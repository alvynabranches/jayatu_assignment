preface
most
of
the
adventures
recorded
in
this
book
really
occurred
one
or
two
were
experiences
of
my
own
the
rest
those
of
boys
who
were
schoolmates
of
mine
huck
finn
is
drawn
from
life
tom
sawyer
also
but
not
from
an
individual
he
is
a
combination
of
the
characteristics
of
three
boys
whom
i
knew
and
therefore
belongs
to
the
composite
order
of
architecture
the
odd
superstitions
touched
upon
were
all
prevalent
among
children
and
slaves
in
the
west
at
the
period
of
this
story
that
is
to
say
thirty
or
forty
years
ago
although
my
book
is
intended
mainly
for
the
entertainment
of
boys
and
girls
i
hope
it
will
not
be
shunned
by
men
and
women
on
that
account
for
part
of
my
plan
has
been
to
try
to
pleasantly
remind
adults
of
what
they
once
were
themselves
and
of
how
they
felt
and
thought
and
talked
and
what
queer
enterprises
they
sometimes
engaged
in
the
author
hartford
chapter
i
tom
no
answer
tom
no
answer
what's
gone
with
that
boy
i
wonder
you
tom
no
answer
the
old
lady
pulled
her
spectacles
down
and
looked
over
them
about
the
room
then
she
put
them
up
and
looked
out
under
them
she
seldom
or
never
looked
through
them
for
so
small
a
thing
as
a
boy
they
were
her
state
pair
the
pride
of
her
heart
and
were
built
for
style
not
service
she
could
have
seen
through
a
pair
of
stove
lids
just
as
well
she
looked
perplexed
for
a
moment
and
then
said
not
fiercely
but
still
loud
enough
for
the
furniture
to
hear
well
i
lay
if
i
get
hold
of
you
i'll
she
did
not
finish
for
by
this
time
she
was
bending
down
and
punching
under
the
bed
with
the
broom
and
so
she
needed
breath
to
punctuate
the
punches
with
she
resurrected
nothing
but
the
cat
i
never
did
see
the
beat
of
that
boy
she
went
to
the
open
door
and
stood
in
it
and
looked
out
among
the
tomato
vines
and
jimpson
weeds
that
constituted
the
garden
no
tom
so
she
lifted
up
her
voice
at
an
angle
calculated
for
distance
and
shouted
y
o
u
u
tom
there
was
a
slight
noise
behind
her
and
she
turned
just
in
time
to
seize
a
small
boy
by
the
slack
of
his
roundabout
and
arrest
his
flight
there
i
might
a
thought
of
that
closet
what
you
been
doing
in
there
nothing
nothing
look
at
your
hands
and
look
at
your
mouth
what
is
that
truck
i
don't
know
aunt
well
i
know
it's
jam
that's
what
it
is
forty
times
i've
said
if
you
didn't
let
that
jam
alone
i'd
skin
you
hand
me
that
switch
the
switch
hovered
in
the
air
the
peril
was
desperate
my
look
behind
you
aunt
the
old
lady
whirled
round
and
snatched
her
skirts
out
of
danger
the
lad
fled
on
the
instant
scrambled
up
the
high
board
fence
and
disappeared
over
it
his
aunt
polly
stood
surprised
a
moment
and
then
broke
into
a
gentle
laugh
hang
the
boy
can't
i
never
learn
anything
ain't
he
played
me
tricks
enough
like
that
for
me
to
be
looking
out
for
him
by
this
time
but
old
fools
is
the
biggest
fools
there
is
can't
learn
an
old
dog
new
tricks
as
the
saying
is
but
my
goodness
he
never
plays
them
alike
two
days
and
how
is
a
body
to
know
what's
coming
he
pears
to
know
just
how
long
he
can
torment
me
before
i
get
my
dander
up
and
he
knows
if
he
can
make
out
to
put
me
off
for
a
minute
or
make
me
laugh
it's
all
down
again
and
i
can't
hit
him
a
lick
i
ain't
doing
my
duty
by
that
boy
and
that's
the
lord's
truth
goodness
knows
spare
the
rod
and
spile
the
child
as
the
good
book
says
i'm
a
laying
up
sin
and
suffering
for
us
both
i
know
he's
full
of
the
old
scratch
but
laws
a
me
he's
my
own
dead
sister's
boy
poor
thing
and
i
ain't
got
the
heart
to
lash
him
somehow
every
time
i
let
him
off
my
conscience
does
hurt
me
so
and
every
time
i
hit
him
my
old
heart
most
breaks
well
a
well
man
that
is
born
of
woman
is
of
few
days
and
full
of
trouble
as
the
scripture
says
and
i
reckon
it's
so
he'll
play
hookey
this
evening
and
southwestern
for
afternoon
i'll
just
be
obleeged
to
make
him
work
tomorrow
to
punish
him
it's
mighty
hard
to
make
him
work
saturdays
when
all
the
boys
is
having
holiday
but
he
hates
work
more
than
he
hates
anything
else
and
i've
got
to
do
some
of
my
duty
by
him
or
i'll
be
the
ruination
of
the
child
tom
did
play
hookey
and
he
had
a
very
good
time
he
got
back
home
barely
in
season
to
help
jim
the
small
colored
boy
saw
next
day's
wood
and
split
the
kindlings
before
supper
at
least
he
was
there
in
time
to
tell
his
adventures
to
jim
while
jim
did
three
fourths
of
the
work
tom's
younger
brother
or
rather
half
brother
sid
was
already
through
with
his
part
of
the
work
picking
up
chips
for
he
was
a
quiet
boy
and
had
no
adventurous
trouble
some
ways
while
tom
was
eating
his
supper
and
stealing
sugar
as
opportunity
offered
aunt
polly
asked
him
questions
that
were
full
of
guile
and
very
deep
for
she
wanted
to
trap
him
into
damaging
revealments
like
many
other
simple
hearted
souls
it
was
her
pet
vanity
to
believe
she
was
endowed
with
a
talent
for
dark
and
mysterious
diplomacy
and
she
loved
to
contemplate
her
most
transparent
devices
as
marvels
of
low
cunning
said
she
tom
it
was
middling
warm
in
school
warn't
it
yes'm
powerful
warm
warn't
it
yes'm
didn't
you
want
to
go
in
a
swimming
tom
a
bit
of
a
scare
shot
through
tom
a
touch
of
uncomfortable
suspicion
he
searched
aunt
polly's
face
but
it
told
him
nothing
so
he
said
no'm
well
not
very
much
the
old
lady
reached
out
her
hand
and
felt
tom's
shirt
and
said
but
you
ain't
too
warm
now
though
and
it
flattered
her
to
reflect
that
she
had
discovered
that
the
shirt
was
dry
without
anybody
knowing
that
that
was
what
she
had
in
her
mind
but
in
spite
of
her
tom
knew
where
the
wind
lay
now
so
he
forestalled
what
might
be
the
next
move
some
of
us
pumped
on
our
heads
mine's
damp
yet
see
aunt
polly
was
vexed
to
think
she
had
overlooked
that
bit
of
circumstantial
evidence
and
missed
a
trick
then
she
had
a
new
inspiration
tom
you
didn't
have
to
undo
your
shirt
collar
where
i
sewed
it
to
pump
on
your
head
did
you
unbutton
your
jacket
the
trouble
vanished
out
of
tom's
face
he
opened
his
jacket
his
shirt
collar
was
securely
sewed
bother
well
go
long
with
you
i'd
made
sure
you'd
played
hookey
and
been
a
swimming
but
i
forgive
ye
tom
i
reckon
you're
a
kind
of
a
singed
cat
as
the
saying
is
better'n
you
look
this
time
she
was
half
sorry
her
sagacity
had
miscarried
and
half
glad
that
tom
had
stumbled
into
obedient
conduct
for
once
but
sidney
said
well
now
if
i
didn't
think
you
sewed
his
collar
with
white
thread
but
it's
black
why
i
did
sew
it
with
white
tom
but
tom
did
not
wait
for
the
rest
as
he
went
out
at
the
door
he
said
siddy
i'll
lick
you
for
that
in
a
safe
place
tom
examined
two
large
needles
which
were
thrust
into
the
lapels
of
his
jacket
and
had
thread
bound
about
them
one
needle
carried
white
thread
and
the
other
black
he
said
she'd
never
noticed
if
it
hadn't
been
for
sid
confound
it
sometimes
she
sews
it
with
white
and
sometimes
she
sews
it
with
black
i
wish
to
gee
miny
she'd
stick
to
one
or
t'other
i
can't
keep
the
run
of
em
but
i
bet
you
i'll
lam
sid
for
that
i'll
learn
him
he
was
not
the
model
boy
of
the
village
he
knew
the
model
boy
very
well
though
and
loathed
him
within
two
minutes
or
even
less
he
had
forgotten
all
his
troubles
not
because
his
troubles
were
one
whit
less
heavy
and
bitter
to
him
than
a
man's
are
to
a
man
but
because
a
new
and
powerful
interest
bore
them
down
and
drove
them
out
of
his
mind
for
the
time
just
as
men's
misfortunes
are
forgotten
in
the
excitement
of
new
enterprises
this
new
interest
was
a
valued
novelty
in
whistling
which
he
had
just
acquired
from
a
negro
and
he
was
suffering
to
practise
it
un
disturbed
it
consisted
in
a
peculiar
bird
like
turn
a
sort
of
liquid
warble
produced
by
touching
the
tongue
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
at
short
intervals
in
the
midst
of
the
music
the
reader
probably
remembers
how
to
do
it
if
he
has
ever
been
a
boy
diligence
and
attention
soon
gave
him
the
knack
of
it
and
he
strode
down
the
street
with
his
mouth
full
of
harmony
and
his
soul
full
of
gratitude
he
felt
much
as
an
astronomer
feels
who
has
discovered
a
new
planet
no
doubt
as
far
as
strong
deep
unalloyed
pleasure
is
concerned
the
advantage
was
with
the
boy
not
the
astronomer
the
summer
evenings
were
long
it
was
not
dark
yet
presently
tom
checked
his
whistle
a
stranger
was
before
him
a
boy
a
shade
larger
than
himself
a
new
comer
of
any
age
or
either
sex
was
an
im
pressive
curiosity
in
the
poor
little
shabby
village
of
st
petersburg
this
boy
was
well
dressed
too
well
dressed
on
a
week
day
this
was
simply
as
astounding
his
cap
was
a
dainty
thing
his
close
buttoned
blue
cloth
roundabout
was
new
and
natty
and
so
were
his
pantaloons
he
had
shoes
on
and
it
was
only
friday
he
even
wore
a
necktie
a
bright
bit
of
ribbon
he
had
a
citified
air
about
him
that
ate
into
tom's
vitals
the
more
tom
stared
at
the
splendid
marvel
the
higher
he
turned
up
his
nose
at
his
finery
and
the
shabbier
and
shabbier
his
own
outfit
seemed
to
him
to
grow
neither
boy
spoke
if
one
moved
the
other
moved
but
only
sidewise
in
a
circle
they
kept
face
to
face
and
eye
to
eye
all
the
time
finally
tom
said
i
can
lick
you
i'd
like
to
see
you
try
it
well
i
can
do
it
no
you
can't
either
yes
i
can
no
you
can't
i
can
you
can't
can
can't
an
uncomfortable
pause
then
tom
said
what's
your
name
tisn't
any
of
your
business
maybe
well
i
low
i'll
make
it
my
business
well
why
don't
you
if
you
say
much
i
will
much
much
much
there
now
oh
you
think
you're
mighty
smart
don't
you
i
could
lick
you
with
one
hand
tied
behind
me
if
i
wanted
to
well
why
don't
you
do
it
you
say
you
can
do
it
well
i
will
if
you
fool
with
me
oh
yes
i've
seen
whole
families
in
the
same
fix
smarty
you
think
you're
some
now
don't
you
oh
what
a
hat
you
can
lump
that
hat
if
you
don't
like
it
i
dare
you
to
knock
it
off
and
anybody
that'll
take
a
dare
will
suck
eggs
you're
a
liar
you're
another
you're
a
fighting
liar
and
dasn't
take
it
up
aw
take
a
walk
say
if
you
give
me
much
more
of
your
sass
i'll
take
and
bounce
a
rock
off'n
your
head
oh
of
course
you
will
well
i
will
well
why
don't
you
do
it
then
what
do
you
keep
saying
you
will
for
why
don't
you
do
it
it's
because
you're
afraid
i
ain't
afraid
you
are
i
ain't
you
are
another
pause
and
more
eying
and
sidling
around
each
other
presently
they
were
shoulder
to
shoulder
tom
said
get
away
from
here
go
away
yourself
i
won't
i
won't
either
so
they
stood
each
with
a
foot
placed
at
an
angle
as
a
brace
and
both
shoving
with
might
and
main
and
glowering
at
each
other
with
hate
but
neither
could
get
an
advantage
after
struggling
till
both
were
hot
and
flushed
each
relaxed
his
strain
with
watchful
caution
and
tom
said
you're
a
coward
and
a
pup
i'll
tell
my
big
brother
on
you
and
he
can
thrash
you
with
his
little
finger
and
i'll
make
him
do
it
too
what
do
i
care
for
your
big
brother
i've
got
a
brother
that's
bigger
than
he
is
and
what's
more
he
can
throw
him
over
that
fence
too
brothers
were
imaginary
that's
a
lie
your
saying
so
don't
make
it
so
tom
drew
a
line
in
the
dust
with
his
big
toe
and
said
i
dare
you
to
step
over
that
and
i'll
lick
you
till
you
can't
stand
up
anybody
that'll
take
a
dare
will
steal
sheep
the
new
boy
stepped
over
promptly
and
said
now
you
said
you'd
do
it
now
let's
see
you
do
it
don't
you
crowd
me
now
you
better
look
out
well
you
said
you'd
do
it
why
don't
you
do
it
by
jingo
for
two
cents
i
will
do
it
the
new
boy
took
two
broad
coppers
out
of
his
pocket
and
held
them
out
with
derision
tom
struck
them
to
the
ground
in
an
instant
both
boys
were
rolling
and
tumbling
in
the
dirt
gripped
together
like
cats
and
for
the
space
of
a
minute
they
tugged
and
tore
at
each
other's
hair
and
clothes
punched
and
scratched
each
other's
nose
and
covered
themselves
with
dust
and
glory
presently
the
confusion
took
form
and
through
the
fog
of
battle
tom
appeared
seated
astride
the
new
boy
and
pounding
him
with
his
fists
holler
nuff
said
he
the
boy
only
struggled
to
free
himself
he
was
crying
mainly
from
rage
holler
nuff
and
the
pounding
went
on
at
last
the
stranger
got
out
a
smothered
nuff
and
tom
let
him
up
and
said
now
that'll
learn
you
better
look
out
who
you're
fooling
with
next
time
the
new
boy
went
off
brushing
the
dust
from
his
clothes
sobbing
snuffling
and
occasionally
looking
back
and
shaking
his
head
and
threatening
what
he
would
do
to
tom
the
next
time
he
caught
him
out
to
which
tom
responded
with
jeers
and
started
off
in
high
feather
and
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
the
new
boy
snatched
up
a
stone
threw
it
and
hit
him
between
the
shoulders
and
then
turned
tail
and
ran
like
an
antelope
tom
chased
the
traitor
home
and
thus
found
out
where
he
lived
he
then
held
a
position
at
the
gate
for
some
time
daring
the
enemy
to
come
outside
but
the
enemy
only
made
faces
at
him
through
the
window
and
declined
at
last
the
enemy's
mother
appeared
and
called
tom
a
bad
vicious
vulgar
child
and
ordered
him
away
so
he
went
away
but
he
said
he
lowed
to
lay
for
that
boy
he
got
home
pretty
late
that
night
and
when
he
climbed
cautiously
in
at
the
window
he
uncovered
an
ambuscade
in
the
person
of
his
aunt
and
when
she
saw
the
state
his
clothes
were
in
her
resolution
to
turn
his
saturday
holiday
into
captivity
at
hard
labor
became
adamantine
in
its
firmness
chapter
ii
saturday
morning
was
come
and
all
the
summer
world
was
bright
and
fresh
and
brimming
with
life
there
was
a
song
in
every
heart
and
if
the
heart
was
young
the
music
issued
at
the
lips
there
was
cheer
in
every
face
and
a
spring
in
every
step
the
locust
trees
were
in
bloom
and
the
fragrance
of
the
blossoms
filled
the
air
cardiff
hill
beyond
the
village
and
above
it
was
green
with
vegetation
and
it
lay
just
far
enough
away
to
seem
a
delectable
land
dreamy
reposeful
and
inviting
tom
appeared
on
the
sidewalk
with
a
bucket
of
whitewash
and
a
long
handled
brush
he
surveyed
the
fence
and
all
gladness
left
him
and
a
deep
melancholy
settled
down
upon
his
spirit
thirty
yards
of
board
fence
nine
feet
high
life
to
him
seemed
hollow
and
existence
but
a
burden
sighing
he
dipped
his
brush
and
passed
it
along
the
topmost
plank
repeated
the
operation
did
it
again
compared
the
insignificant
whitewashed
streak
with
the
far
reaching
continent
of
unwhitewashed
fence
and
sat
down
on
a
tree
box
discouraged
jim
came
skipping
out
at
the
gate
with
a
tin
pail
and
singing
buffalo
gals
bringing
water
from
the
town
pump
had
always
been
hateful
work
in
tom's
eyes
before
but
now
it
did
not
strike
him
so
he
remembered
that
there
was
company
at
the
pump
white
mulatto
and
negro
boys
and
girls
were
always
there
waiting
their
turns
resting
trading
playthings
quarrelling
fighting
skylarking
and
he
remembered
that
although
the
pump
was
only
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
off
jim
never
got
back
with
a
bucket
of
water
under
an
hour
and
even
then
somebody
generally
had
to
go
after
him
tom
said
say

besides
if
you

i'll
show
you
my
sore
toe
jim
was
only
human
this
attraction
was
too
much
for
him
he
put
down
his
pail
took
the
white
alley
and
bent
over
the
toe
with
absorbing
interest
while
the
bandage
was
being
unwound
in
another
moment
he
was
flying
down
the
street
with
his
pail
and
a
tingling
rear
tom
was
whitewashing
with
vigor
and
aunt
polly
was
retiring
from
the
field
with
a
slipper
in
her
hand
and
triumph
in
her
eye
but
tom's
energy
did
not
last
he
began
to
think
of
the
fun
he
had
planned
for
this
day
and
his
sorrows
multiplied
soon
the
free
boys
would
come
tripping
along
on
all
sorts
of
delicious
expeditions
and
they
would
make
a
world
of
fun
of
him
for
having
to
work
the
very
thought
of
it
burnt
him
like
fire
he
got
out
his
worldly
wealth
and
examined
it
bits
of
toys
marbles
and
trash
enough
to
buy
an
exchange
of
work
maybe
but
not
half
enough
to
buy
so
much
as
half
an
hour
of
pure
freedom
so
he
returned
his
straitened
means
to
his
pocket
and
gave
up
the
idea
of
trying
to
buy
the
boys
at
this
dark
and
hopeless
moment
an
inspiration
burst
upon
him
nothing
less
than
a
great
magnificent
inspiration
he
took
up
his
brush
and
went
tranquilly
to
work
ben
rogers
hove
in
sight
presently
the
very
boy
of
all
boys
whose
ridicule
he
had
been
dreading
ben's
gait
was
the
hop
skip
and
jump
proof
enough
that
his
heart
was
light
and
his
anticipations
high
he
was
eating
an
apple
and
giving
a
long
melodious
whoop
at
intervals
followed
by
a
deep
toned
ding
dong
dong
ding
dong
dong
for
he
was
personating
a
steamboat
as
he
drew
near
he
slackened
speed
took
the
middle
of
the
street
leaned
far
over
to
starboard
and
rounded
to
ponderously
and
with
laborious
pomp
and
circumstance
for
he
was
personating
the
big
missouri
and
considered
himself
to
be
drawing
nine
feet
of
water
he
was
boat
and
captain
and
engine
bells
combined
so
he
had
to
imagine
himself
standing
on
his
own
hurricane

tom
went
on

paid
no
attention
to
the
steamboat
ben
stared
a
moment
and
then
said
hi
yi
you're
up
a
stump
ain't
you
no
answer
tom
surveyed
his
last
touch
with
the
eye
of
an
artist
then
he
gave
his
brush
another
gentle
sweep
and
surveyed
the
result
as
before
ben
ranged
up
alongside
of
him
tom's
mouth
watered
for
the
apple
but
he
stuck
to
his
work
ben
said
hello
old
chap
you
got
to
work
hey
tom
wheeled
suddenly
and
said
why
it's
you
ben
i
warn't
noticing
say
i'm
going
in
a
swimming
i
am
don't
you
wish
you
could
but
of
course
you'd
druther
work
wouldn't
you
course
you
would
tom
contemplated
the
boy
a
bit
and
said
what
do
you
call
work
why
ain't
that
work
tom
resumed
his
whitewashing
and
answered
carelessly
well
maybe
it
is
and
maybe
it
ain't
all
i
know
is
it
suits
tom
sawyer
oh
come
now
you
don't
mean
to
let
on
that
you
like
it
the
brush
continued
to
move
like
it
well
i
don't
see
why
i
oughtn't
to
like
it
does
a
boy
get
a
chance
to
whitewash
a
fence
every
day
that
put
the
thing
in
a
new
light
ben
stopped
nibbling
his
apple
tom
swept
his
brush
daintily
back
and
forth
stepped
back
to
note
the
effect
added
a
touch
here
and
there
criticised
the
effect
again
ben
watching
every
move
and
getting
more
and
more
interested
more
and
more
absorbed
presently
he
said
say
tom
let
me
whitewash
a
little
tom
considered
was
about
to
consent
but
he
altered
his
mind
no
no
i
reckon
it
wouldn't
hardly
do
ben
you
see
aunt
polly's
awful
particular
about
this
fence
right
here
on
the
street
you
know
but
if
it
was
the
back
fence
i
wouldn't
mind
and
she
wouldn't
yes
she's
awful
particular
about
this
fence
it's
got
to
be
done
very
careful
i
reckon
there
ain't
one
boy
in
a
thousand
maybe
two
thousand
that
can
do
it
the
way
it's
got
to
be
done
no
is
that
so
oh
come
now
lemme
just
try
only
just
a
little
i'd
let
you
if
you
was
me
tom
ben
i'd
like
to
honest
injun
but
aunt
polly
well
jim
wanted
to
do
it
but
she
wouldn't
let
him
sid
wanted
to
do
it
and
she
wouldn't
let
sid
now
don't
you
see
how
i'm
fixed
if
you
was
to
tackle
this
fence
and
anything
was
to
happen
to
it
oh
shucks
i'll
be
just
as
careful
now
lemme
try
say
i'll
give
you
the
core
of
my
apple
well
here
no
ben
now
don't
i'm
afeard
i'll
give
you
all
of
it
tom
gave
up
the
brush
with
reluctance
in
his
face
but
alacrity
in
his
heart
and
while
the
late
steamer
big
missouri
worked
and
sweated
in
the
sun
the
retired
artist
sat
on
a
barrel
in
the
shade
close
by
dangled
his
legs
munched
his
apple
and
planned
the
slaughter
of
more
innocents
there
was
no
lack
of
material
boys
happened
along
every
little
while
they
came
to
jeer
but
remained
to
whitewash
by
the
time
ben
was
fagged
out
tom
had
traded
the
next
chance
to
billy
fisher
for
a
kite
in
good
repair
and
when
he
played
out
johnny
miller
bought
in
for
a
dead
rat
and
a
string
to
swing
it
with
and
so
on
and
so
on
hour
after
hour
and
when
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
came
from
being
a
poor
poverty
stricken
boy
in
the
morning
tom
was
literally
rolling
in
wealth
he
had
besides
the
things
before
mentioned
twelve
marbles
part
of
a
jews
harp
a
piece
of
blue
bottle
glass
to
look
through
a
spool
cannon
a
key
that
wouldn't
unlock
anything
a
fragment
of
chalk
a
glass
stopper
of
a
decanter
a
tin
soldier
a
couple
of
tadpoles
six
fire
crackers
a
kitten
with
only
one
eye
a
brass
door
knob
a
dog
collar
but
no
dog
the
handle
of
a
knife
four
pieces
of
orange
peel
and
a
dilapidated
old
window
sash
he
had
had
a
nice
good
idle
time
all
the
while
plenty
of
company
and
the
fence
had
three
coats
of
whitewash
on
it
if
he
hadn't
run
out
of
whitewash
he
would
have
bankrupted
every
boy
in
the
village
tom
said
to
himself
that
it
was
not
such
a
hollow
world
after
all
he
had
discovered
a
great
law
of
human
action
without
knowing
it
namely
that
in
order
to
make
a
man
or
a
boy
covet
a
thing
it
is
only
necessary
to
make
the
thing
difficult
to
attain
if
he
had
been
a
great
and
wise
philosopher
like
the
writer
of
this
book
he
would
now
have
comprehended
that
work
consists
of
whatever
a
body
is
obliged
to
do
and
that
play
consists
of
whatever
a
body
is
not
obliged
to
do
and
this
would
help
him
to
understand
why
constructing
artificial
flowers
or
performing
on
a
tread
mill
is
work
while
rolling
ten
pins
or
climbing
mont
blanc
is
only
amusement
there
are
wealthy
gentlemen
in
england
who
drive
four
horse
passenger
coaches
twenty
or
thirty
miles
on
a
daily
line
in
the
summer
because
the
privilege
costs
them
considerable
money
but
if
they
were
offered
wages
for
the
service
that
would
turn
it
into
work
and
then
they
would
resign
the
boy
mused
awhile
over
the
substantial
change
which
had
taken
place
in
his
worldly
circumstances
and
then
wended
toward
headquarters
to
report
chapter
iii
tom
presented
himself
before
aunt
polly
who
was
sitting
by
an
open
window
in
a
pleasant
rearward
apartment
which
was
bedroom
breakfast
room
dining
room
and
library
combined
the
balmy
summer
air
the
restful
quiet
the
odor
of
the
flowers
and
the
drowsing
murmur
of
the
bees
had
had
their
effect
and
she
was
nodding
over
her
knitting
for
she
had
no
company
but
the
cat
and
it
was
asleep
in
her
lap
her
spectacles
were
propped
up
on
her
gray
head
for
safety
she
had
thought
that
of
course
tom
had
deserted
long
ago
and
she
wondered
at
seeing
him
place
himself
in
her
power
again
in
this
intrepid
way
he
said
mayn't
i
go
and
play
now
aunt
what
a'ready
how
much
have
you
done
it's
all
done
aunt
tom
don't
lie
to
me
i
can't
bear
it
i
ain't
aunt
it
is
all
done
aunt
polly
placed
small
trust
in
such
evidence
she
went
out
to
see
for
herself
and
she
would
have
been
content
to
find
twenty
per
cent
of
tom's
statement
true
when
she
found
the
entire
fence
white
washed
and
not
only
whitewashed
but
elaborately
coated
and
recoated
and
even
a
streak
added
to
the
ground
her
astonishment
was
almost
unspeakable
she
said
well
i
never
there's
no
getting
round
it
you
can
work
when
you're
a
mind
to
tom
and
then
she
diluted
the
compliment
by
adding
but
it's
powerful
seldom
you're
a
mind
to
i'm
bound
to
say
well
go
long
and
play
but
mind
you
get
back
some
time
in
a
week
or
i'll
tan
you
she
was
so
overcome
by
the
splendor
of
his
achievement
that
she
took
him
into
the
closet
and
selected
a
choice
apple
and
delivered
it
to
him
along
with
an
improving
lecture
upon
the
added
value
and
flavor
a
treat
took
to
itself
when
it
came
without
sin
through
virtuous
effort
and
while
she
closed
with
a
happy
scriptural
flourish
he
hooked
a
doughnut
then
he
skipped
out
and
saw
sid
just
starting
up
the
outside
stairway
that
led
to
the
back
rooms
on
the
second
floor
clods
were
handy
and
the
air
was
full
of
them
in
a
twinkling
they
raged
around
sid
like
a
hail
storm
and
before
aunt
polly
could
collect
her
surprised
faculties
and
sally
to
the
rescue
six
or
seven
clods
had
taken
personal
effect
and
tom
was
over
the
fence
and
gone
there
was
a
gate
but
as
a
general
thing
he
was
too
crowded
for
time
to
make
use
of
it
his
soul
was
at
peace
now
that
he
had
settled
with
sid
for
calling
attention
to
his
black
thread
and
getting
him
into
trouble
tom
skirted
the
block
and
came
round
into
a
muddy
alley
that
led
by
the
back
of
his
aunt's
cow
stable
he
presently
got
safely
beyond
the
reach
of
capture
and
punishment
and
hastened
toward
the
public
square
of
the
village
where
two
military
companies
of
boys
had
met
for
conflict
according
to
previous
appointment
tom
was
general
of
one
of
these
armies
joe
harper
a
bosom
friend
general
of
the
other
these
two
great
commanders
did
not
condescend
to
fight
in
person
that
being
better
suited
to
the
still
smaller
fry
but
sat
together
on
an
eminence
and
conducted
the
field
operations
by
orders
delivered
through
aides
de
camp
tom's
army
won
a
great
victory
after
a
long
and
hard
fought
battle
then
the
dead
were
counted
prisoners
exchanged
the
terms
of
the
next
disagreement
agreed
upon
and
the
day
for
the
necessary
battle
appointed
after
which
the
armies
fell
into
line
and
marched
away
and
tom
turned
homeward
alone
as
he
was
passing
by
the
house
where
jeff
thatcher
lived
he
saw
a
new
girl
in
the
garden
a
lovely
little
blue
eyed
creature
with
yellow
hair
plaited
into
two
long
tails
white
summer
frock
and
embroidered
pan
talettes
the
fresh
crowned
hero
fell
without
firing
a
shot
a
certain
amy
lawrence
vanished
out
of
his
heart
and
left
not
even
a
memory
of
herself
behind
he
had
thought
he
loved
her
to
distraction
he
had
regarded
his
passion
as
adoration
and
behold
it
was
only
a
poor
little
evanescent
partiality
he
had
been
months
winning
her
she
had
confessed
hardly
a
week
ago
he
had
been
the
happiest
and
the
proudest
boy
in
the
world
only
seven
short
days
and
here
in
one
instant
of
time
she
had
gone
out
of
his
heart
like
a
casual
stranger
whose
visit
is
done
he
worshipped
this
new
angel
with
furtive
eye
till
he
saw
that
she
had
discovered
him
then
he
pretended
he
did
not
know
she
was
present
and
began
to
show
off
in
all
sorts
of
absurd
boyish
ways
in
order
to
win
her
admiration
he
kept
up
this
grotesque
foolishness
for
some
time
but
by
and
by
while
he
was
in
the
midst
of
some
dangerous
gymnastic
performances
he
glanced
aside
and
saw
that
the
little
girl
was
wending
her
way
toward
the
house
tom
came
up
to
the
fence
and
leaned
on
it
grieving
and
hoping
she
would
tarry
yet
awhile
longer
she
halted
a
moment
on
the
steps
and
then
moved
toward
the
door
tom
heaved
a
great
sigh
as
she
put
her
foot
on
the
threshold
but
his
face
lit
up
right
away
for
she
tossed
a
pansy
over
the
fence
a
moment
before
she
disappeared
the
boy
ran
around
and
stopped
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
flower
and
then
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
began
to
look
down
street
as
if
he
had
discovered
something
of
interest
going
on
in
that
direction
presently
he
picked
up
a
straw
and
began
trying
to
balance
it
on
his
nose
with
his
head
tilted
far
back
and
as
he
moved
from
side
to
side
in
his
efforts
he
edged
nearer
and
nearer
toward
the
pansy
finally
his
bare
foot
rested
upon
it
his
pliant
toes
closed
upon
it
and
he
hopped
away
with
the
treasure
and
disappeared
round
the
corner
but
only
for
a
minute
only
while
he
could
button
the
flower
inside
his
jacket
next
his
heart
or
next
his
stomach
possibly
for
he
was
not
much
posted
in
anatomy
and
not
hypercritical
anyway
he
returned
now
and
hung
about
the
fence
till
nightfall
showing
off
as
before
but
the
girl
never
exhibited
herself
again
though
tom
comforted
himself
a
little
with
the
hope
that
she
had
been
near
some
window
meantime
and
been
aware
of
his
attentions
finally
he
strode
home
reluctantly
with
his
poor
head
full
of
visions
all
through
supper
his
spirits
were
so
high
that
his
aunt
wondered
what
had
got
into
the
child
he
took
a
good
scolding
about
clodding
sid
and
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
in
the
least
he
tried
to
steal
sugar
under
his
aunt's
very
nose
and
got
his
knuckles
rapped
for
it
he
said
aunt
you
don't
whack
sid
when
he
takes
it
well
sid
don't
torment
a
body
the
way
you
do
you'd
be
always
into
that
sugar
if
i
warn't
watching
you
presently
she
stepped
into
the
kitchen
and
sid
happy
in
his
immunity
reached
for
the
sugar
bowl
a
sort
of
glorying
over
tom
which
was
wellnigh
unbearable
but
sid's
fingers
slipped
and
the
bowl
dropped
and
broke
tom
was
in
ecstasies
in
such
ecstasies
that
he
even
controlled
his
tongue
and
was
silent
he
said
to
himself
that
he
would
not
speak
a
word
even
when
his
aunt
came
in
but
would
sit
perfectly
still
till
she
asked
who
did
the
mischief
and
then
he
would
tell
and
there
would
be
nothing
so
good
in
the
world
as
to
see
that
pet
model
catch
it
he
was
so
brimful
of
exultation
that
he
could
hardly
hold
himself
when
the
old
lady
came
back
and
stood
above
the
wreck
discharging
lightnings
of
wrath
from
over
her
spectacles
he
said
to
himself
now
it's
coming
and
the
next
instant
he
was
sprawling
on
the
floor
the
potent
palm
was
uplifted
to
strike
again
when
tom
cried
out
hold
on
now
what
er
you
belting
me
for
sid
broke
it
aunt
polly
paused
perplexed
and
tom
looked
for
healing
pity
but
when
she
got
her
tongue
again
she
only
said
umf
well
you
didn't
get
a
lick
amiss
i
reckon
you
been
into
some
other
audacious
mischief
when
i
wasn't
around
like
enough
then
her
conscience
reproached
her
and
she
yearned
to
say
something
kind
and
loving
but
she
judged
that
this
would
be
construed
into
a
confession
that
she
had
been
in
the
wrong
and
discipline
forbade
that
so
she
kept
silence
and
went
about
her
affairs
with
a
troubled
heart
tom
sulked
in
a
corner
and
exalted
his
woes
he
knew
that
in
her
heart
his
aunt
was
on
her
knees
to
him
and
he
was
morosely
gratified
by
the
consciousness
of
it
he
would
hang
out
no
signals
he
would
take
notice
of
none
he
knew
that
a
yearning
glance
fell
upon
him
now
and
then
through
a
film
of
tears
but
he
refused
recognition
of
it
he
pictured
himself
lying
sick
unto
death
and
his
aunt
bending
over
him
beseeching
one
little
forgiving
word
but
he
would
turn
his
face
to
the
wall
and
die
with
that
word
unsaid
ah
how
would
she
feel
then
and
he
pictured
himself
brought
home
from
the
river
dead
with
his
curls
all
wet
and
his
sore
heart
at
rest
how
she
would
throw
herself
upon
him
and
how
her
tears
would
fall
like
rain
and
her
lips
pray
god
to
give
her
back
her
boy
and
she
would
never
never
abuse
him
any
more
but
he
would
lie
there
cold
and
white
and
make
no
sign
a
poor
little
sufferer
whose
griefs
were
at
an
end
he
so
worked
upon
his
feelings
with
the
pathos
of
these
dreams
that
he
had
to
keep
swallowing
he
was
so
like
to
choke
and
his
eyes
swam
in
a
blur
of
water
which
overflowed
when
he
winked
and
ran
down
and
trickled
from
the
end
of
his
nose
and
such
a
luxury
to
him
was
this
petting
of
his
sorrows
that
he
could
not
bear
to
have
any
worldly
cheeriness
or
any
grating
delight
intrude
upon
it
it
was
too
sacred
for
such
contact
and
so
presently
when
his
cousin
mary
danced
in
all
alive
with
the
joy
of
seeing
home
again
after
an
age
long
visit
of
one
week
to
the
country
he
got
up
and
moved
in
clouds
and
darkness
out
at
one
door
as
she
brought
song
and
sunshine
in
at
the
other
he
wandered
far
from
the
accustomed
haunts
of
boys
and
sought
desolate
places
that
were
in
harmony
with
his
spirit
a
log
raft
in
the
river
invited
him
and
he
seated
himself
on
its
outer
edge
and
contemplated
the
dreary
vastness
of
the
stream
wishing
the
while
that
he
could
only
be
drowned
all
at
once
and
unconsciously
without
undergoing
the
uncomfortable
routine
devised
by
nature
then
he
thought
of
his
flower
he
got
it
out
rumpled
and
wilted
and
it
mightily
increased
his
dismal
felicity
he
wondered
if
she
would
pity
him
if
she
knew
would
she
cry
and
wish
that
she
had
a
right
to
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
comfort
him
or
would
she
turn
coldly
away
like
all
the
hollow
world
this
picture
brought
such
an
agony
of
pleasurable
suffering
that
he
worked
it
over
and
over
again
in
his
mind
and
set
it
up
in
new
and
varied
lights
till
he
wore
it
threadbare
at
last
he
rose
up
sighing
and
departed
in
the
darkness
about
half
past
nine
or
ten
o'clock
he
came
along
the
deserted
street
to
where
the
adored
unknown
lived
he
paused
a
moment
no
sound
fell
upon
his
listening
ear
a
candle
was
casting
a
dull
glow
upon
the
curtain
of
a
second
story
window
was
the
sacred
presence
there
he
climbed
the
fence
threaded
his
stealthy
way
through
the
plants
till
he
stood
under
that
window
he
looked
up
at
it
long
and
with
emotion
then
he
laid
him
down
on
the
ground
under
it
disposing
himself
upon
his
back
with
his
hands
clasped
upon
his
breast
and
holding
his
poor
wilted
flower
and
thus
he
would
die
out
in
the
cold
world
with
no
shelter
over
his
homeless
head
no
friendly
hand
to
wipe
the
death
damps
from
his
brow
no
loving
face
to
bend
pityingly
over
him
when
the
great
agony
came
and
thus
she
would
see
him
when
she
looked
out
upon
the
glad
morning
and
oh
would
she
drop
one
little
tear
upon
his
poor
lifeless
form
would
she
heave
one
little
sigh
to
see
a
bright
young
life
so
rudely
blighted
so
untimely
cut
down
the
window
went
up
a
maid
servant's
discordant
voice
profaned
the
holy
calm
and
a
deluge
of
water
drenched
the
prone
martyr's
remains
the
strangling
hero
sprang
up
with
a
relieving
snort
there
was
a
whiz
as
of
a
missile
in
the
air
mingled
with
the
murmur
of
a
curse
a
sound
as
of
shivering
glass
followed
and
a
small
vague
form
went
over
the
fence
and
shot
away
in
the
gloom
not
long
after
as
tom
all
undressed
for
bed
was
surveying
his
drenched
garments
by
the
light
of
a
tallow
dip
sid
woke
up
but
if
he
had
any
dim
idea
of
making
any
references
to
allusions
he
thought
better
of
it
and
held
his
peace
for
there
was
danger
in
tom's
eye
tom
turned
in
without
the
added
vexation
of
prayers
and
sid
made
mental
note
of
the
omission
chapter
iv
the
sun
rose
upon
a
tranquil
world
and
beamed
down
upon
the
peaceful
village
like
a
benediction
breakfast
over
aunt
polly
had
family
worship
it
began
with
a
prayer
built
from
the
ground
up
of
solid
courses
of
scriptural
quotations
welded
together
with
a
thin
mortar
of
originality
and
from
the
summit
of
this
she
delivered
a
grim
chapter
of
the
mosaic
law
as
from
sinai
then
tom
girded
up
his
loins
so
to
speak
and
went
to
work
to
get
his
verses
sid
had
learned
his
lesson
days
before
tom
bent
all
his
energies
to
the
memorizing
of
five
verses
and
he
chose
part
of
the
sermon
on
the
mount
because
he
could
find
no
verses
that
were
shorter
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
tom
had
a
vague
general
idea
of
his
lesson
but
no
more
for
his
mind
was
traversing
the
whole
field
of
human
thought
and
his
hands
were
busy
with
distracting
recreations
mary
took
his
book
to
hear
him
recite
and
he
tried
to
find
his
way
through
the
fog
blessed
are
the
a
a
poor
yes
poor
blessed
are
the
poor
a
a

what
why
don't
you
tell
me
mary
what
do
you
want
to
be
so
mean
for
oh
tom
you
poor
thick
headed
thing
i'm
not
teasing
you
i
wouldn't
do
that
you
must
go
and
learn
it
again
don't
you
be
discouraged
tom
you'll
manage
it
and
if
you
do
i'll
give
you
something
ever
so
nice
there
now
that's
a
good
boy
all
right
what
is
it
mary
tell
me
what
it
is
never
you
mind
tom
you
know
if
i
say
it's
nice
it
is
nice
you
bet
you
that's
so
mary
all
right
i'll
tackle
it
again
and
he
did
tackle
it
again
and
under
the
double
pressure
of
curiosity
and
prospective
gain
he
did
it
with
such
spirit
that
he
accomplished
a
shining
success
mary
gave
him
a
brand
new
barlow
knife
worth
twelve
and
a
half
cents
and
the
convulsion
of
delight
that
swept
his
system
shook
him
to
his
foundations
true
the
knife
would
not
cut
anything
but
it
was
a
sure
enough
barlow
and
there
was
inconceivable
grandeur
in
that
though
where
the
western
boys
ever
got
the
idea
that
such
a
weapon
could
possibly
be
counterfeited
to
its
injury
is
an
imposing
mystery
and
will
always
remain
so
perhaps
tom
contrived
to
scarify
the
cupboard
with
it
and
was
arranging
to
begin
on
the
bureau
when
he
was
called
off
to
dress
for
sunday
school
mary
gave
him
a
tin
basin
of
water
and
a
piece
of
soap
and
he
went
outside
the
door
and
set
the
basin
on
a
little
bench
there
then
he
dipped
the
soap
in
the
water
and
laid
it
down
turned
up
his
sleeves
poured
out
the
water
on
the
ground
gently
and
then
entered
the
kitchen
and
began
to
wipe
his
face
diligently
on
the
towel
behind
the
door
but
mary
removed
the
towel
and
said
now
ain't
you
ashamed
tom
you
mustn't
be
so
bad
water
won't
hurt
you
tom
was
a
trifle
disconcerted
the
basin
was
refilled
and
this
time
he
stood
over
it
a
little
while
gathering
resolution
took
in
a
big
breath
and
began
when
he
entered
the
kitchen
presently
with
both
eyes
shut
and
groping
for
the
towel
with
his
hands
an
honorable
testimony
of
suds
and
water
was
dripping
from
his
face
but
when
he
emerged
from
the
towel
he
was
not
yet
satisfactory
for
the
clean
territory
stopped
short
at
his
chin
and
his
jaws
like
a
mask
below
and
beyond
this
line
there
was
a
dark
expanse
of
unirrigated
soil
that
spread
downward
in
front
and
backward
around
his
neck
mary
took
him
in
hand
and
when
she
was
done
with
him
he
was
a
man
and
a
brother
without
distinction
of
color
and
his
saturated
hair
was
neatly
brushed
and
its
short
curls
wrought
into
a
dainty
and
symmetrical
general
effect
privately
smoothed
out
the
curls
with
labor
and
difficulty
and
plastered
his
hair
close
down
to
his
head
for
he
held
curls
to
be
effeminate
and
his
own
filled
his
life
with
bitterness
then
mary
got
out
a
suit
of
his
clothing
that
had
been
used
only
on
sundays
during
two
years
they
were
simply
called
his
other
clothes
and
so
by
that
we
know
the
size
of
his
wardrobe
the
girl
put
him
to
rights
after
he
had
dressed
himself
she
buttoned
his
neat
roundabout
up
to
his
chin
turned
his
vast
shirt
collar
down
over
his
shoulders
brushed
him
off
and
crowned
him
with
his
speckled
straw
hat
he
now
looked
exceedingly
improved
and
uncomfortable
he
was
fully
as
uncomfortable
as
he
looked
for
there
was
a
restraint
about
whole
clothes
and
cleanliness
that
galled
him
he
hoped
that
mary
would
forget
his
shoes
but
the
hope
was
blighted
she
coated
them
thoroughly
with
tallow
as
was
the
custom
and
brought
them
out
he
lost
his
temper
and
said
he
was
always
being
made
to
do
everything
he
didn't
want
to
do
but
mary
said
persuasively
please
tom
that's
a
good
boy
so
he
got
into
the
shoes
snarling
mary
was
soon
ready
and
the
three
children
set
out
for
sunday
school
a
place
that
tom
hated
with
his
whole
heart
but
sid
and
mary
were
fond
of
it
sabbath
school
hours
were
from
nine
to
half
past
ten
and
then
church
service
two
of
the
children
always
remained
for
the
sermon
voluntarily
and
the
other
always
remained
too
for
stronger
reasons
the
church's
high
backed
uncushioned
pews
would
seat
about
three
hundred
persons
the
edifice
was
but
a
small
plain
affair
with
a
sort
of
pine
board
tree
box
on
top
of
it
for
a
steeple
at
the
door
tom
dropped
back
a
step
and
accosted
a
sunday
dressed
comrade
say
billy
got
a
yaller
ticket
yes
what'll
you
take
for
her
what'll
you
give
piece
of
lickrish
and
a
fish
hook
less
see
em
tom
exhibited
they
were
satisfactory
and
the
property
changed
hands
then
tom
traded
a
couple
of
white
alleys
for
three
red
tickets
and
some
small
trifle
or
other
for
a
couple
of
blue
ones
he
waylaid
other
boys
as
they
came
and
went
on
buying
tickets
of
various
colors
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
longer
he
entered
the
church
now
with
a
swarm
of
clean
and
noisy
boys
and
girls
proceeded
to
his
seat
and
started
a
quarrel
with
the
first
boy
that
came
handy
the
teacher
a
grave
elderly
man
interfered
then
turned
his
back
a
moment
and
tom
pulled
a
boy's
hair
in
the
next
bench
and
was
absorbed
in
his
book
when
the
boy
turned
around
stuck
a
pin
in
another
boy
presently
in
order
to
hear
him
say
ouch
and
got
a
new
reprimand
from
his
teacher
tom's
whole
class
were
of
a
pattern
restless
noisy
and
troublesome
when
they
came
to
recite
their
lessons
not
one
of
them
knew
his
verses
perfectly
but
had
to
be
prompted
all
along
however
they
worried
through
and
each
got
his
reward
in
small
blue
tickets
each
with
a
passage
of
scripture
on
it
each
blue
ticket
was
pay
for
two
verses
of
the
recitation
ten
blue
tickets
equalled
a
red
one
and
could
be
exchanged
for
it
ten
red
tickets
equalled
a
yellow
one
for
ten
yellow
tickets
the
superintendent
gave
a
very
plainly
bound
bible
worth
forty
cents
in
those
easy
times
to
the
pupil
how
many
of
my
readers
would
have
the
industry
and
application
to
memorize
two
thousand
verses
even
for
a
dore
bible
and
yet
mary
had
acquired
two
bibles
in
this
way
it
was
the
patient
work
of
two
years
and
a
boy
of
german
parentage
had
won
four
or
five
he
once
recited
three
thousand
verses
without
stopping
but
the
strain
upon
his
mental
faculties
was
too
great
and
he
was
little
better
than
an
idiot
from
that
day
forth
a
grievous
misfortune
for
the
school
for
on
great
occasions
before
company
the
superintendent
as
tom
expressed
it
had
always
made
this
boy
come
out
and
spread
himself
only
the
older
pupils
managed
to
keep
their
tickets
and
stick
to
their
tedious
work
long
enough
to
get
a
bible
and
so
the
delivery
of
one
of
these
prizes
was
a
rare
and
noteworthy
circumstance
the
successful
pupil
was
so
great
and
conspicuous
for
that
day
that
on
the
spot
every
scholar's
heart
was
fired
with
a
fresh
ambition
that
often
lasted
a
couple
of
weeks
it
is
possible
that
tom's
mental
stomach
had
never
really
hungered
for
one
of
those
prizes
but
unquestionably
his
entire
being
had
for
many
a
day
longed
for
the
glory
and
the
eclat
that
came
with
it
in
due
course
the
superintendent
stood
up
in
front
of
the
pulpit
with
a
closed
hymn
book
in
his
hand
and
his
forefinger
inserted
between
its
leaves
and
commanded
attention
when
a
sunday
school
superintendent
makes
his
customary
little
speech
a
hymn
book
in
the
hand
is
as
necessary
as
is
the
inevitable
sheet
of
music
in
the
hand
of
a
singer
who
stands
forward
on
the
platform
and
sings
a
solo
at
a
concert
though
why
is
a
mystery
for
neither
the
hymn
book
nor
the
sheet
of
music
is
ever
referred
to
by
the
sufferer
this
superintendent
was
a
slim
creature
of
thirty
five
with
a
sandy
goatee
and
short
sandy
hair
he
wore
a
stiff
standing
collar
whose
upper
edge
almost
reached
his
ears
and
whose
sharp
points
curved
forward
abreast
the
corners
of
his
mouth
a
fence
that
compelled
a
straight
lookout
ahead
and
a
turning
of
the
whole
body
when
a
side
view
was
required
his
chin
was
propped
on
a
spreading
cravat
which
was
as
broad
and
as
long
as
a
bank
note
and
had
fringed
ends
his
boot
toes
were
turned
sharply
up
in
the
fashion
of
the
day
like
sleigh
runners
an
effect
patiently
and
laboriously
produced
by
the
young
men
by
sitting
with
their
toes
pressed
against
a
wall
for
hours
together
mr
walters
was
very
earnest
of
mien
and
very
sincere
and
honest
at
heart
and
he
held
sacred
things
and
places
in
such
reverence
and
so
separated
them
from
worldly
matters
that
unconsciously
to
himself
his
sunday
school
voice
had
acquired
a
peculiar
intonation
which
was
wholly
absent
on
week
days
he
began
after
this
fashion
now
children
i
want
you
all
to
sit
up
just
as
straight
and
pretty
as
you
can
and
give
me
all
your
attention
for
a
minute
or
two
there
that
is
it
that
is
the
way
good
little
boys
and
girls
should
do
i
see
one
little
girl
who
is
looking
out
of
the
window
i
am
afraid
she
thinks
i
am
out
there
somewhere
perhaps
up
in
one
of
the
trees
making
a
speech
to
the
little
birds
titter
i
want
to
tell
you
how
good
it
makes
me
feel
to
see
so
many
bright
clean
little
faces
assembled
in
a
place
like
this
learning
to
do
right
and
be
good
and
so
forth
and
so
on
it
is
not
necessary
to
set
down
the
rest
of
the
oration
it
was
of
a
pattern
which
does
not
vary
and
so
it
is
familiar
to
us
all
the
latter
third
of
the
speech
was
marred
by
the
resumption
of
fights
and
other
recreations
among
certain
of
the
bad
boys
and
by
fidgetings
and
whisperings
that
extended
far
and
wide
washing
even
to
the
bases
of
isolated
and
incorruptible
rocks
like
sid
and
mary
but
now
every
sound
ceased
suddenly
with
the
subsidence
of
mr
walters
voice
and
the
conclusion
of
the
speech
was
received
with
a
burst
of
silent
gratitude
a
good
part
of
the
whispering
had
been
occasioned
by
an
event
which
was
more
or
less
rare
the
entrance
of
visitors
lawyer
thatcher
accompanied
by
a
very
feeble
and
aged
man
a
fine
portly
middle
aged
gentleman
with
iron
gray
hair
and
a
dignified
lady
who
was
doubtless
the
latter's
wife
the
lady
was
leading
a
child
tom
had
been
restless
and
full
of
chafings
and
repinings
conscience
smitten
too
he
could
not
meet
amy
lawrence's
eye
he
could
not
brook
her
loving
gaze
but
when
he
saw
this
small
newcomer
his
soul
was
all
ablaze
with
bliss
in
a
moment
the
next
moment
he
was
showing
off
with
all
his
might
cuffing
boys
pulling
hair
making
faces
in
a
word
using
every
art
that
seemed
likely
to
fascinate
a
girl
and
win
her
applause
his
exaltation
had
but
one
alloy
the
memory
of
his
humiliation
in
this
angel's
garden
and
that
record
in
sand
was
fast
washing
out
under
the
waves
of
happiness
that
were
sweeping
over
it
now
the
visitors
were
given
the
highest
seat
of
honor
and
as
soon
as
mr
walters
speech
was
finished
he
introduced
them
to
the
school
the
middle
aged
man
turned
out
to
be
a
prodigious
personage
no
less
a
one
than
the
county
judge
altogether
the
most
august
creation
these
children
had
ever
looked
upon
and
they
wondered
what
kind
of
material
he
was
made
of
and
they
half
wanted
to
hear
him
roar
and
were
half
afraid
he
might
too
he
was
from
constantinople
twelve
miles
away
so
he
had
travelled
and
seen
the
world
these
very
eyes
had
looked
upon
the
county
court
house
which
was
said
to
have
a
tin
roof
the
awe
which
these
reflections
inspired
was
attested
by
the
impressive
silence
and
the
ranks
of
staring
eyes
this
was
the
great
judge
thatcher
brother
of
their
own
lawyer
jeff
thatcher
immediately
went
forward
to
be
familiar
with
the
great
man
and
be
envied
by
the
school
it
would
have
been
music
to
his
soul
to
hear
the
whisperings
look
at
him
jim
he's
a
going
up
there
say
look
he's
a
going
to
shake
hands
with
him
he
is
shaking
hands
with
him
by
jings
don't
you
wish
you
was
jeff
mr
walters
fell
to
showing
off
with
all
sorts
of
official
bustlings
and
activities
giving
orders
delivering
judgments
discharging
directions
here
there
everywhere
that
he
could
find
a
target
the
librarian
showed
off
running
hither
and
thither
with
his
arms
full
of
books
and
making
a
deal
of
the
splutter
and
fuss
that
insect
authority
delights
in
the
young
lady
teachers
showed
off
bending
sweetly
over
pupils
that
were
lately
being
boxed
lifting
pretty
warning
fingers
at
bad
little
boys
and
patting
good
ones
lovingly
the
young
gentlemen
teachers
showed
off
with
small
scoldings
and
other
little
displays
of
authority
and
fine
attention
to
discipline
and
most
of
the
teachers
of
both
sexes
found
business
up
at
the
library
by
the
pulpit
and
it
was
business
that
frequently
had
to
be
done
over
again
two
or
three
times
with
much
seeming
vexation
the
little
girls
showed
off
in
various
ways
and
the
little
boys
showed
off
with
such
diligence
that
the
air
was
thick
with
paper
wads
and
the
murmur
of
scufflings
and
above
it
all
the
great
man
sat
and
beamed
a
majestic
judicial
smile
upon
all
the
house
and
warmed
himself
in
the
sun
of
his
own
grandeur
for
he
was
showing
off
too
there
was
only
one
thing
wanting
to
make
mr
walters
ecstasy
complete
and
that
was
a
chance
to
deliver
a
bible
prize
and
exhibit
a
prodigy
several
pupils
had
a
few
yellow
tickets
but
none
had
enough
he
had
been
around
among
the
star
pupils
inquiring
he
would
have
given
worlds
now
to
have
that
german
lad
back
again
with
a
sound
mind
and
now
at
this
moment
when
hope
was
dead
tom
sawyer
came
forward
with
nine
yellow
tickets
nine
red
tickets
and
ten
blue
ones
and
demanded
a
bible
this
was
a
thunderbolt
out
of
a
clear
sky
walters
was
not
expecting
an
application
from
this
source
for
the
next
ten
years
but
there
was
no
getting
around
it
here
were
the
certified
checks
and
they
were
good
for
their
face
tom
was
therefore
elevated
to
a
place
with
the
judge
and
the
other
elect
and
the
great
news
was
announced
from
headquarters
it
was
the
most
stunning
surprise
of
the
decade
and
so
profound
was
the
sensation
that
it
lifted
the
new
hero
up
to
the
judicial
one's
altitude
and
the
school
had
two
marvels
to
gaze
upon
in
place
of
one
the
boys
were
all
eaten
up
with
envy
but
those
that
suffered
the
bitterest
pangs
were
those
who
perceived
too
late
that
they
themselves
had
contributed
to
this
hated
splendor
by
trading
tickets
to
tom
for
the
wealth
he
had
amassed
in
selling
whitewashing
privileges
these
despised
themselves
as
being
the
dupes
of
a
wily
fraud
a
guileful
snake
in
the
grass
the
prize
was
delivered
to
tom
with
as
much
effusion
as
the
superintendent
could
pump
up
under
the
circumstances
but
it
lacked
somewhat
of
the
true
gush
for
the
poor
fellow's
instinct
taught
him
that
there
was
a
mystery
here
that
could
not
well
bear
the
light
perhaps
it
was
simply
preposterous
that
this
boy
had
warehoused
two
thousand
sheaves
of
scriptural
wisdom
on
his
premises
a
dozen
would
strain
his
capacity
without
a
doubt
amy
lawrence
was
proud
and
glad
and
she
tried
to
make
tom
see
it
in
her
face
but
he
wouldn't
look
she
wondered
then
she
was
just
a
grain
troubled
next
a
dim
suspicion
came
and
went
came
again
she
watched
a
furtive
glance
told
her
worlds
and
then
her
heart
broke
and
she
was
jealous
and
angry
and
the
tears
came
and
she
hated
everybody
tom
most
of
all
she
thought
tom
was
introduced
to
the
judge
but
his
tongue
was
tied
his
breath
would
hardly
come
his
heart
quaked
partly
because
of
the
awful
greatness
of
the
man
but
mainly
because
he
was
her
parent
he
would
have
liked
to
fall
down
and
worship
him
if
it
were
in
the
dark
the
judge
put
his
hand
on
tom's
head
and
called
him
a
fine
little
man
and
asked
him
what
his
name
was
the
boy
stammered
gasped
and
got
it
out
tom
oh
no
not
tom
it
is
thomas
ah
that's
it
i
thought
there
was
more
to
it
maybe
that's
very
well
but
you've
another
one
i
daresay
and
you'll
tell
it
to
me
won't
you
tell
the
gentleman
your
other
name
thomas
said
walters
and
say
sir
you
mustn't
forget
your
manners
thomas
sawyer
sir
that's
it
that's
a
good
boy
fine
boy
fine
manly
little
fellow
two
thousand
verses
is
a
great
many
very
very
great
many
and
you
never
can
be
sorry
for
the
trouble
you
took
to
learn
them
for
knowledge
is
worth
more
than
anything
there
is
in
the
world
it's
what
makes
great
men
and
good
men
you'll
be
a
great
man
and
a
good
man
yourself
some
day
thomas
and
then
you'll
look
back
and
say
it's
all
owing
to
the
precious
sunday
school
privileges
of
my
boyhood
it's
all
owing
to
my
dear
teachers
that
taught
me
to
learn
it's
all
owing
to
the
good
superintendent
who
encouraged
me
and
watched
over
me
and
gave
me
a
beautiful
bible
a
splendid
elegant
bible
to
keep
and
have
it
all
for
my
own
always
it's
all
owing
to
right
bringing
up
that
is
what
you
will
say
thomas
and
you
wouldn't
take
any
money
for
those
two
thousand
verses
no
indeed
you
wouldn't
and
now
you
wouldn't
mind
telling
me
and
this
lady
some
of
the
things
you've
learned
no
i
know
you
wouldn't
for
we
are
proud
of
little
boys
that
learn
now
no
doubt
you
know
the
names
of
all
the
twelve
disciples
won't
you
tell
us
the
names
of
the
first
two
that
were
appointed
tom
was
tugging
at
a
button
hole
and
looking
sheepish
he
blushed
now
and
his
eyes
fell
mr
walters
heart
sank
within
him
he
said
to
himself
it
is
not
possible
that
the
boy
can
answer
the
simplest
question
why
did
the
judge
ask
him
yet
he
felt
obliged
to
speak
up
and
say
answer
the
gentleman
thomas
don't
be
afraid
tom
still
hung
fire
now
i
know
you'll
tell
me
said
the
lady
the
names
of
the
first
two
disciples
were
david
and
goliah
let
us
draw
the
curtain
of
charity
over
the
rest
of
the
scene
chapter
v
about
half
past
ten
the
cracked
bell
of
the
small
church
began
to
ring
and
presently
the
people
began
to
gather
for
the
morning
sermon
the
sunday
school
children
distributed
themselves
about
the
house
and
occupied
pews
with
their
parents
so
as
to
be
under
supervision
aunt
polly
came
and
tom
and
sid
and
mary
sat
with
her
tom
being
placed
next
the
aisle
in
order
that
he
might
be
as
far
away
from
the
open
window
and
the
seductive
outside
summer
scenes
as
possible
the
crowd
filed
up
the
aisles
the
aged
and
needy
postmaster
who
had
seen
better
days
the
mayor
and
his
wife
for
they
had
a
mayor
there
among
other
unnecessaries
the
justice
of
the
peace
the
widow
douglass
fair
smart
and
forty
a
generous
good
hearted
soul
and
well
to
do
her
hill
mansion
the
only
palace
in
the
town
and
the
most
hospitable
and
much
the
most
lavish
in
the
matter
of
festivities
that
st
petersburg
could
boast
the
bent
and
venerable
major
and
mrs
ward
lawyer
riverson
the
new
notable
from
a
distance
next
the
belle
of
the
village
followed
by
a
troop
of
lawn
clad
and
ribbon
decked
young
heart
breakers
then
all
the
young
clerks
in
town
in
a
body
for
they
had
stood
in
the
vestibule
sucking
their
cane
heads
a
circling
wall
of
oiled
and
simpering
admirers
till
the
last
girl
had
run
their
gantlet
and
last
of
all
came
the
model
boy
willie
mufferson
taking
as
heedful
care
of
his
mother
as
if
she
were
cut
glass
he
always
brought
his
mother
to
church
and
was
the
pride
of
all
the
matrons
the
boys
all
hated
him
he
was
so
good
and
besides
he
had
been
thrown
up
to
them
so
much
his
white
handkerchief
was
hanging
out
of
his
pocket
behind
as
usual
on
sundays
accidentally
tom
had
no
handkerchief
and
he
looked
upon
boys
who
had
as
snobs
the
congregation
being
fully
assembled
now
the
bell
rang
once
more
to
warn
laggards
and
stragglers
and
then
a
solemn
hush
fell
upon
the
church
which
was
only
broken
by
the
tittering
and
whispering
of
the
choir
in
the
gallery
the
choir
always
tittered
and
whispered
all
through
service
there
was
once
a
church
choir
that
was
not
ill
bred
but
i
have
forgotten
where
it
was
now
it
was
a
great
many
years
ago
and
i
can
scarcely
remember
anything
about
it
but
i
think
it
was
in
some
foreign
country
the
minister
gave
out
the
hymn
and
read
it
through
with
a
relish
in
a
peculiar
style
which
was
much
admired
in
that
part
of
the
country
his
voice
began
on
a
medium
key
and
climbed
steadily
up
till
it
reached
a
certain
point
where
it
bore
with
strong
emphasis
upon
the
topmost
word
and
then
plunged
down
as
if
from
a
spring
board
shall
i
be
car
ri
ed
toe
the
skies
on
flow'ry
beds
of
ease
whilst
others
fight
to
win
the
prize
and
sail
thro
blood
y
seas
he
was
regarded
as
a
wonderful
reader
at
church
sociables
he
was
always
called
upon
to
read
poetry
and
when
he
was
through
the
ladies
would
lift
up
their
hands
and
let
them
fall
helplessly
in
their
laps
and
wall
their
eyes
and
shake
their
heads
as
much
as
to
say
words
cannot
express
it
it
is
too
beautiful
too
beautiful
for
this
mortal
earth
after
the
hymn
had
been
sung
the
rev
mr
sprague
turned
himself
into
a
bulletin
board
and
read
off
notices
of
meetings
and
societies
and
things
till
it
seemed
that
the
list
would
stretch
out
to
the
crack
of
doom
a
queer
custom
which
is
still
kept
up
in
america
even
in
cities
away
here
in
this
age
of
abundant
newspapers
often
the
less
there
is
to
justify
a
traditional
custom
the
harder
it
is
to
get
rid
of
it
and
now
the
minister
prayed
a
good
generous
prayer
it
was
and
went
into
details
it
pleaded
for
the
church
and
the
little
children
of
the
church
for
the
other
churches
of
the
village
for
the
village
itself
for
the
county
for
the
state
for
the
state
officers
for
the
united
states
for
the
churches
of
the
united
states
for
congress
for
the
president
for
the
officers
of
the
government
for
poor
sailors
tossed
by
stormy
seas
for
the
oppressed
millions
groaning
under
the
heel
of
european
monarchies
and
oriental
despotisms
for
such
as
have
the
light
and
the
good
tidings
and
yet
have
not
eyes
to
see
nor
ears
to
hear
withal
for
the
heathen
in
the
far
islands
of
the
sea
and
closed
with
a
supplication
that
the
words
he
was
about
to
speak
might
find
grace
and
favor
and
be
as
seed
sown
in
fertile
ground
yielding
in
time
a
grateful
harvest
of
good
amen
there
was
a
rustling
of
dresses
and
the
standing
congregation
sat
down
the
boy
whose
history
this
book
relates
did
not
enjoy
the
prayer
he
only
endured
it
if
he
even
did
that
much
he
was
restive
all
through
it
he
kept
tally
of
the
details
of
the
prayer
unconsciously
for
he
was
not
listening
but
he
knew
the
ground
of
old
and
the
clergyman's
regular
route
over
it
and
when
a
little
trifle
of
new
matter
was
interlarded
his
ear
detected
it
and
his
whole
nature
resented
it
he
considered
additions
unfair
and
scoundrelly
in
the
midst
of
the
prayer
a
fly
had
lit
on
the
back
of
the
pew
in
front
of
him
and
tortured
his
spirit
by
calmly
rubbing
its
hands
together
embracing
its
head
with
its
arms
and
polishing
it
so
vigorously
that
it
seemed
to
almost
part
company
with
the
body
and
the
slender
thread
of
a
neck
was
exposed
to
view
scraping
its
wings
with
its
hind
legs
and
smoothing
them
to
its
body
as
if
they
had
been
coat
tails
going
through
its
whole
toilet
as
tranquilly
as
if
it
knew
it
was
perfectly
safe
as
indeed
it
was
for
as
sorely
as
tom's
hands
itched
to
grab
for
it
they
did
not
dare
he
believed
his
soul
would
be
instantly
destroyed
if
he
did
such
a
thing
while
the
prayer
was
going
on
but
with
the
closing
sentence
his
hand
began
to
curve
and
steal
forward
and
the
instant
the
amen
was
out
the
fly
was
a
prisoner
of
war
his
aunt
detected
the
act
and
made
him
let
it
go
the
minister
gave
out
his
text
and
droned
along
monotonously
through
an
argument
that
was
so
prosy
that
many
a
head
by
and
by
began
to
nod
and
yet
it
was
an
argument
that
dealt
in
limitless
fire
and
brimstone
and
thinned
the
predestined
elect
down
to
a
company
so
small
as
to
be
hardly
worth
the
saving
tom
counted
the
pages
of
the
sermon
after
church
he
always
knew
how
many
pages
there
had
been
but
he
seldom
knew
anything
else
about
the
discourse
however
this
time
he
was
really
interested
for
a
little
while
the
minister
made
a
grand
and
moving
picture
of
the
assembling
together
of
the
world's
hosts
at
the
millennium
when
the
lion
and
the
lamb
should
lie
down
together
and
a
little
child
should
lead
them
but
the
pathos
the
lesson
the
moral
of
the
great
spectacle
were
lost
upon
the
boy
he
only
thought
of
the
conspicuousness
of
the
principal
character
before
the
on
looking
nations
his
face
lit
with
the
thought
and
he
said
to
himself
that
he
wished
he
could
be
that
child
if
it
was
a
tame
lion
now
he
lapsed
into
suffering
again
as
the
dry
argument
was
resumed
presently
he
bethought
him
of
a
treasure
he
had
and
got
it
out
it
was
a
large
black
beetle
with
formidable
jaws
a
pinchbug
he
called
it
it
was
in
a
percussion
cap
box
the
first
thing
the
beetle
did
was
to
take
him
by
the
finger
a
natural
fillip
followed
the
beetle
went
floundering
into
the
aisle
and
lit
on
its
back
and
the
hurt
finger
went
into
the
boy's
mouth
the
beetle
lay
there
working
its
helpless
legs
unable
to
turn
over
tom
eyed
it
and
longed
for
it
but
it
was
safe
out
of
his
reach
other
people
uninterested
in
the
sermon
found
relief
in
the
beetle
and
they
eyed
it
too
presently
a
vagrant
poodle
dog
came
idling
along
sad
at
heart
lazy
with
the
summer
softness
and
the
quiet
weary
of
captivity
sighing
for
change
he
spied
the
beetle
the
drooping
tail
lifted
and
wagged
he
surveyed
the
prize
walked
around
it
smelt
at
it
from
a
safe
distance
walked
around
it
again
grew
bolder
and
took
a
closer
smell
then
lifted
his
lip
and
made
a
gingerly
snatch
at
it
just
missing
it
made
another
and
another
began
to
enjoy
the
diversion
subsided
to
his
stomach
with
the
beetle
between
his
paws
and
continued
his
experiments
grew
weary
at
last
and
then
indifferent
and
absent
minded
his
head
nodded
and
little
by
little
his
chin
descended
and
touched
the
enemy
who
seized
it
there
was
a
sharp
yelp
a
flirt
of
the
poodle's
head
and
the
beetle
fell
a
couple
of
yards
away
and
lit
on
its
back
once
more
the
neighboring
spectators
shook
with
a
gentle
inward
joy
several
faces
went
behind
fans
and
hand
kerchiefs
and
tom
was
entirely
happy
the
dog
looked
foolish
and
probably
felt
so
but
there
was
resentment
in
his
heart
too
and
a
craving
for
revenge
so
he
went
to
the
beetle
and
began
a
wary
attack
on
it
again
jumping
at
it
from
every
point
of
a
circle
lighting
with
his
fore
paws
within
an
inch
of
the
creature
making
even
closer
snatches
at
it
with
his
teeth
and
jerking
his
head
till
his
ears
flapped
again
but
he
grew
tired
once
more
after
a
while
tried
to
amuse
himself
with
a
fly
but
found
no
relief
followed
an
ant
around
with
his
nose
close
to
the
floor
and
quickly
wearied
of
that
yawned
sighed
forgot
the
beetle
entirely
and
sat
down
on
it
then
there
was
a
wild
yelp
of
agony
and
the
poodle
went
sailing
up
the
aisle
the
yelps
continued
and
so
did
the
dog
he
crossed
the
house
in
front
of
the
altar
he
flew
down
the
other
aisle
he
crossed
before
the
doors
he
clamored
up
the
home
stretch
his
anguish
grew
with
his
progress
till
presently
he
was
but
a
woolly
comet
moving
in
its
orbit
with
the
gleam
and
the
speed
of
light
at
last
the
frantic
sufferer
sheered
from
its
course
and
sprang
into
its
master's
lap
he
flung
it
out
of
the
window
and
the
voice
of
distress
quickly
thinned
away
and
died
in
the
distance
by
this
time
the
whole
church
was
red
faced
and
suffocating
with
suppressed
laughter
and
the
sermon
had
come
to
a
dead
standstill
the
discourse
was
resumed
presently
but
it
went
lame
and
halting
all
possibility
of
impressiveness
being
at
an
end
for
even
the
gravest
sentiments
were
constantly
being
received
with
a
smothered
burst
of
unholy
mirth
under
cover
of
some
remote
pew
back
as
if
the
poor
parson
had
said
a
rarely
facetious
thing
it
was
a
genuine
relief
to
the
whole
congregation
when
the
ordeal
was
over
and
the
benediction
pronounced
tom
sawyer
went
home
quite
cheerful
thinking
to
himself
that
there
was
some
satisfaction
about
divine
service
when
there
was
a
bit
of
variety
in
it
he
had
but
one
marring
thought
he
was
willing
that
the
dog
should
play
with
his
pinchbug
but
he
did
not
think
it
was
upright
in
him
to
carry
it
off
chapter
vi
monday
morning
found
tom
sawyer
miserable
monday
morning
always
found
him
so
because
it
began
another
week's
slow
suffering
in
school
he
generally
began
that
day
with
wishing
he
had
had
no
intervening
holiday
it
made
the
going
into
captivity
and
fetters
again
so
much
more
odious
tom
lay
thinking
presently
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
wished
he
was
sick
then
he
could
stay
home
from
school
here
was
a
vague
possibility
he
canvassed
his
system
no
ailment
was
found
and
he
investigated
again
this
time
he
thought
he
could
detect
colicky
symptoms
and
he
began
to
encourage
them
with
considerable
hope
but
they
soon
grew
feeble
and
presently
died
wholly
away
he
reflected
further
suddenly
he
discovered
something
one
of
his
upper
front
teeth
was
loose
this
was
lucky
he
was
about
to
begin
to
groan
as
a
starter
as
he
called
it
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
came
into
court
with
that
argument
his
aunt
would
pull
it
out
and
that
would
hurt
so
he
thought
he
would
hold
the
tooth
in
reserve
for
the
present
and
seek
further
nothing
offered
for
some
little
time
and
then
he
remembered
hearing
the
doctor
tell
about
a
certain
thing
that
laid
up
a
patient
for
two
or
three
weeks
and
threatened
to
make
him
lose
a
finger
so
the
boy
eagerly
drew
his
sore
toe
from
under
the
sheet
and
held
it
up
for
inspection
but
now
he
did
not
know
the
necessary
symptoms
however
it
seemed
well
worth
while
to
chance
it
so
he
fell
to
groaning
with
considerable
spirit
but
sid
slept
on
unconscious
tom
groaned
louder
and
fancied
that
he
began
to
feel
pain
in
the
toe
no
result
from
sid
tom
was
panting
with
his
exertions
by
this
time
he
took
a
rest
and
then
swelled
himself
up
and
fetched
a
succession
of
admirable
groans
sid
snored
on
tom
was
aggravated
he
said
sid
sid
and
shook
him
this
course
worked
well
and
tom
began
to
groan
again
sid
yawned
stretched
then
brought
himself
up
on
his
elbow
with
a
snort
and
began
to
stare
at
tom
tom
went
on
groaning
sid
said
tom
say
tom
response
here
tom
tom
what
is
the
matter
tom
and
he
shook
him
and
looked
in
his
face
anxiously
tom
moaned
out
oh
don't
sid
don't
joggle
me
why
what's
the
matter
tom
i
must
call
auntie
no
never
mind
it'll
be
over
by
and
by
maybe
don't
call
anybody
but
i
must
don't
groan
so
tom
it's
awful
how
long
you
been
this
way
hours
ouch
oh
don't
stir
so
sid
you'll
kill
me
tom
why
didn't
you
wake
me
sooner
oh
tom
don't
it
makes
my
flesh
crawl
to
hear
you
tom
what
is
the
matter
i
forgive
you
everything
sid
everything
you've
ever
done
to
me
when
i'm
gone
oh
tom
you
ain't
dying
are
you
don't
tom
oh
don't
maybe
i
forgive
everybody
sid
tell
em
so
sid
and
sid
you
give
my
window
sash
and
my
cat
with
one
eye
to
that
new
girl
that's
come
to
town
and
tell
her
but
sid
had
snatched
his
clothes
and
gone
tom
was
suffering
in
reality
now
so
handsomely
was
his
imagination
working
and
so
his
groans
had
gathered
quite
a
genuine
tone
sid
flew
downstairs
and
said
oh
aunt
polly
come
tom's
dying
dying
yes'm
don't
wait
come
quick
rubbage
i
don't
believe
it
but
she
fled
upstairs
nevertheless
with
sid
and
mary
at
her
heels
and
her
face
grew
white
too
and
her
lip
trembled
when
she
reached
the
bedside
she
gasped
out
you
tom
tom
what's
the
matter
with
you
oh
auntie
i'm
what's
the
matter
with
you
what
is
the
matter
with
you
child
oh
auntie
my
sore
toe's
mortified
the
old
lady
sank
down
into
a
chair
and
laughed
a
little
then
cried
a
little
then
did
both
together
this
restored
her
and
she
said
tom
what
a
turn
you
did
give
me
now
you
shut
up
that
nonsense
and
climb
out
of
this
the
groans
ceased
and
the
pain
vanished
from
the
toe
the
boy
felt
a
little
foolish
and
he
said
aunt
polly
it
seemed
mortified
and
it
hurt
so
i
never
minded
my
tooth
at
all
your
tooth
indeed
what's
the
matter
with
your
tooth
one
of
them's
loose
and
it
aches
perfectly
awful
there
there
now
don't
begin
that
groaning
again
open
your
mouth
well
your
tooth
is
loose
but
you're
not
going
to
die
about
that
mary
get
me
a
silk
thread
and
a
chunk
of
fire
out
of
the
kitchen
tom
said
oh
please
auntie
don't
pull
it
out
it
don't
hurt
any
more
i
wish
i
may
never
stir
if
it
does
please
don't
auntie
i
don't
want
to
stay
home
from
school
oh
you
don't
don't
you
so
all
this
row
was
because
you
thought
you'd
get
to
stay
home
from
school
and
go
a
fishing
tom
tom
i
love
you
so
and
you
seem
to
try
every
way
you
can
to
break
my
old
heart
with
your
outrageousness
by
this
time
the
dental
instruments
were
ready
the
old
lady
made
one
end
of
the
silk
thread
fast
to
tom's
tooth
with
a
loop
and
tied
the
other
to
the
bedpost
then
she
seized
the
chunk
of
fire
and
suddenly
thrust
it
almost
into
the
boy's
face
the
tooth
hung
dangling
by
the
bedpost
now
but
all
trials
bring
their
compensations
as
tom
wended
to
school
after
breakfast
he
was
the
envy
of
every
boy
he
met
because
the
gap
in
his
upper
row
of
teeth
enabled
him
to
expectorate
in
a
new
and
admirable
way
he
gathered
quite
a
following
of
lads
interested
in
the
exhibition
and
one
that
had
cut
his
finger
and
had
been
a
centre
of
fascination
and
homage
up
to
this
time
now
found
himself
suddenly
without
an
adherent
and
shorn
of
his
glory
his
heart
was
heavy
and
he
said
with
a
disdain
which
he
did
not
feel
that
it
wasn't
anything
to
spit
like
tom
sawyer
but
another
boy
said
sour
grapes
and
he
wandered
away
a
dismantled
hero
shortly
tom
came
upon
the
juvenile
pariah
of
the
village
huckleberry
finn
son
of
the
town
drunkard
huckleberry
was
cordially
hated
and
dreaded
by
all
the
mothers
of
the
town
because
he
was
idle
and
lawless
and
vulgar
and
bad
and
because
all
their
children
admired
him
so
and
delighted
in
his
forbidden
society
and
wished
they
dared
to
be
like
him
tom
was
like
the
rest
of
the
respectable
boys
in
that
he
envied
huckleberry
his
gaudy
outcast
condition
and
was
under
strict
orders
not
to
play
with
him
so
he
played
with
him
every
time
he
got
a
chance
huckleberry
was
always
dressed
in
the
cast
off
clothes
of
full
grown
men
and
they
were
in
perennial
bloom
and
fluttering
with
rags
his
hat
was
a
vast
ruin
with
a
wide
crescent
lopped
out
of
its
brim
his
coat
when
he
wore
one
hung
nearly
to
his
heels
and
had
the
rearward
buttons
far
down
the
back
but
one
suspender
supported
his
trousers
the
seat
of
the
trousers
bagged
low
and
contained
nothing
the
fringed
legs
dragged
in
the
dirt
when
not
rolled
up
huckleberry
came
and
went
at
his
own
free
will
he
slept
on
doorsteps
in
fine
weather
and
in
empty
hogsheads
in
wet
he
did
not
have
to
go
to
school
or
to
church
or
call
any
being
master
or
obey
anybody
he
could
go
fishing
or
swimming
when
and
where
he
chose
and
stay
as
long
as
it
suited
him
nobody
forbade
him
to
fight
he
could
sit
up
as
late
as
he
pleased
he
was
always
the
first
boy
that
went
barefoot
in
the
spring
and
the
last
to
resume
leather
in
the
fall
he
never
had
to
wash
nor
put
on
clean
clothes
he
could
swear
wonderfully
in
a
word
everything
that
goes
to
make
life
precious
that
boy
had
so
thought
every
harassed
hampered
respectable
boy
in
st
petersburg
tom
hailed
the
romantic
outcast

the
slaughter
house
where'd
you

the
blue
ticket

off'n
ben
rogers
two
weeks
ago
for
a
hoop
stick
say
what
is
dead
cats
good
for
huck
good
for
cure
warts
with
no
is
that
so
i
know
something
that's
better
i
bet
you
don't
what
is
it
why
spunk
water
spunk
water
i
wouldn't
give
a
dern
for
spunk
water
you
wouldn't
wouldn't
you
d'you
ever
try
it
no
i
hain't
but
bob
tanner
did
who
told
you
so
why
he
told
jeff
thatcher
and
jeff
told
johnny
baker
and
johnny
told
jim
hollis
and
jim
told
ben
rogers
and
ben
told
a
nigger
and
the
nigger
told
me
there
now
well
what
of
it
they'll
all
lie
leastways
all
but
the
nigger
i
don't
know
him
but
i
never
see
a
nigger
that
wouldn't
lie
shucks
now
you
tell
me
how
bob
tanner
done
it
huck
why
he
took
and
dipped
his
hand
in
a
rotten
stump
where
the
rain
water
was
in
the
daytime
certainly
with
his
face
to
the
stump
yes
least
i
reckon
so
did
he
say
anything
i
don't
reckon
he
did
i
don't
know
aha
talk
about
trying
to
cure
warts
with
spunk
water
such
a
blame
fool
way
as
that
why
that
ain't
a
going
to
do
any
good
you
got
to
go
all
by
yourself
to
the
middle
of
the
woods
where
you
know
there's
a
spunk
water
stump
and
just
as
it's
midnight
you
back
up
against
the
stump
and
jam
your
hand
in
and
say
barley
corn
barley
corn
injun
meal
shorts
spunk
water
spunk
water
swaller
these
warts
and
then
walk
away
quick
eleven
steps
with
your
eyes
shut
and
then
turn
around
three
times
and
walk
home
without
speaking
to
anybody
because
if
you
speak
the
charm's
busted
well
that
sounds
like
a
good
way
but
that
ain't
the
way
bob
tanner
done
no
sir
you
can
bet
he
didn't
becuz
he's
the
wartiest
boy
in
this
town
and
he
wouldn't
have
a
wart
on
him
if
he'd
knowed
how
to
work
spunk
water
i've
took
off
thousands
of
warts
off
of
my
hands
that
way
huck
i
play
with
frogs
so
much
that
i've
always
got
considerable
many
warts
sometimes
i
take
em
off
with
a
bean
yes
bean's
good
i've
done
that
have
you
what's
your
way
you
take
and
split
the
bean
and
cut
the
wart
so
as
to
get
some
blood
and
then
you
put
the
blood
on
one
piece
of
the
bean
and
take
and
dig
a
hole
and
bury
it
bout
midnight
at
the
crossroads
in
the
dark
of
the
moon
and
then
you
burn
up
the
rest
of
the
bean
you
see
that
piece
that's
got
the
blood
on
it
will
keep
drawing
and
drawing
trying
to
fetch
the
other
piece
to
it
and
so
that
helps
the
blood
to
draw
the
wart
and
pretty
soon
off
she
comes
yes
that's
it
huck
that's
it
though
when
you're
burying
it
if
you
say
down
bean
off
wart
come
no
more
to
bother
me
it's
better
that's
the
way
joe
harper
does
and
he's
been
nearly
to
coonville
and
most
everywheres
but
say
how
do
you
cure
em
with
dead
cats
why
you
take
your
cat
and
go
and
get
in
the
grave
yard
long
about
midnight
when
somebody
that
was
wicked
has
been
buried
and
when
it's
midnight
a
devil
will
come
or
maybe
two
or
three
but
you
can't
see
em
you
can
only
hear
something
like
the
wind
or
maybe
hear
em
talk
and
when
they're
taking
that
feller
away
you
heave
your
cat
after
em
and
say
devil
follow
corpse
cat
follow
devil
warts
follow
cat
i'm
done
with
ye
that'll
fetch
any
wart
sounds
right
d'you
ever
try
it
huck
no
but
old
mother
hopkins
told
me
well
i
reckon
it's
so
then
becuz
they
say
she's
a
witch

own
self
he
come
along
one
day
and
he
see
she
was
a
witching
him
so
he
took
up
a
rock
and
if
she
hadn't
dodged
he'd
a
got
her
well
that
very
night
he
rolled
off'n
a
shed
wher
he
was
a
layin
drunk
and
broke
his
arm
why
that's
awful
how
did
he

mumble
becuz
when
they

they're
saying
the
lord's
prayer
backards
say
hucky
when
you
going
to
try
the
cat

old
hoss
williams
to
night
but
they
buried
him
saturday

they
get
him
saturday
night
why

their
charms

till
midnight
and
then

sunday
devils
don't
slosh
around
much
of
a
sunday
i
don't
reckon
i
never
thought
of
that
that's
so
lemme
go
with
you
of
course
if
you
ain't
afeard
afeard

and
you
meow

if

a

meowing
around

a
brick
through

that
night
becuz
auntie

watching
me
but
i'll
meow
this
time

what's
that
nothing
but
a
tick
where'd
you
get
him
out
in
the
woods
what'll
you
take
for
him
i
don't
know
i
don't
want
to
sell
him
all
right
it's
a
mighty
small
tick
anyway
oh
anybody
can
run
a
tick
down
that
don't
belong
to
them
i'm
satisfied
with
it
it's
a
good
enough
tick
for
me
sho
there's
ticks
a
plenty
i
could
have
a
thousand
of
em
if
i
wanted
to
well
why
don't
you
becuz
you
know
mighty
well
you
can't
this
is
a
pretty
early
tick
i
reckon
it's
the
first
one
i've
seen
this
year
say
huck
i'll
give
you
my
tooth
for
him
less
see
it
tom
got
out
a
bit
of
paper
and
carefully
unrolled
it
huckleberry
viewed
it
wistfully
the
temptation
was
very
strong
at
last
he
said
is
it
genuwyne
tom
lifted
his
lip
and
showed
the
vacancy
well
all
right
said
huckleberry
it's
a
trade
tom
enclosed
the
tick
in
the
percussion
cap
box
that
had
lately
been
the
pinchbug's
prison
and
the
boys
separated
each
feeling
wealthier
than
before
when
tom
reached
the
little
isolated
frame
school
house
he
strode
in
briskly
with
the
manner
of
one
who
had
come
with
all
honest
speed
he
hung
his
hat
on
a
peg
and
flung
himself
into
his
seat
with
business
like
alacrity
the
master
throned
on
high
in
his
great
splint
bottom
arm
chair
was
dozing
lulled
by
the
drowsy
hum
of
study
the
interruption
roused
him
thomas
sawyer
tom
knew
that
when
his
name
was
pronounced
in
full
it
meant
trouble
sir
come
up
here
now
sir
why
are
you
late
again
as
usual
tom
was
about
to
take
refuge
in
a
lie
when
he
saw
two
long
tails
of
yellow
hair
hanging
down
a
back
that
he
recognized
by
the
electric
sympathy
of
love
and
by
that
form
was
the
only
vacant
place
on
the
girls
side
of
the
school
house
he
instantly
said
i
stopped
to
talk
with
huckleberry
finn
the
master's
pulse
stood
still
and
he
stared
helplessly
the
buzz
of
study
ceased
the
pupils
wondered
if
this
foolhardy
boy
had
lost
his
mind
the
master
said
you
you
did
what
stopped
to
talk
with
huckleberry
finn
there
was
no
mistaking
the
words
thomas
sawyer
this
is
the
most
astounding
confession
i
have
ever
listened
to
no
mere
ferule
will
answer
for
this
offence
take
off
your
jacket
the
master's
arm
performed
until
it
was
tired
and
the
stock
of
switches
notably
diminished
then
the
order
followed
now
sir
go
and
sit
with
the
girls
and
let
this
be
a
warning
to
you
the
titter
that
rippled
around
the
room
appeared
to
abash
the
boy
but
in
reality
that
result
was
caused
rather
more
by
his
worshipful
awe
of
his
unknown
idol
and
the
dread
pleasure
that
lay
in
his
high
good
fortune
he
sat
down
upon
the
end
of
the
pine
bench
and
the
girl
hitched
herself
away
from
him
with
a
toss
of
her
head
nudges
and
winks
and
whispers
traversed
the
room
but
tom
sat
still
with
his
arms
upon
the
long
low
desk
before
him
and
seemed
to
study
his
book
by
and
by
attention
ceased
from
him
and
the
accustomed
school
murmur
rose
upon
the
dull
air
once
more
presently
the
boy
began
to
steal
furtive
glances
at
the
girl
she
observed
it
made
a
mouth
at
him
and
gave
him
the
back
of
her
head
for
the
space
of
a
minute
when
she
cautiously
faced
around
again
a
peach
lay
before
her
she
thrust
it
away
tom
gently
put
it
back
she
thrust
it
away
again
but
with
less
animosity
tom
patiently
returned
it
to
its
place
then
she
let
it
remain
tom
scrawled
on
his
slate
please
take
it
i
got
more
the
girl
glanced
at
the
words
but
made
no
sign
now
the
boy
began
to
draw
something
on
the
slate
hiding
his
work
with
his
left
hand
for
a
time
the
girl
refused
to
notice
but
her
human
curiosity
presently
began
to
manifest
itself
by
hardly
perceptible
signs
the
boy
worked
on
apparently
unconscious
the
girl
made
a
sort
of
non
committal
attempt
to
see
but
the
boy
did
not
betray
that
he
was
aware
of
it
at
last
she
gave
in
and
hesitatingly
whispered
let
me
see
it
tom
partly
uncovered
a
dismal
caricature
of
a
house
with
two
gable
ends
to
it
and
a
corkscrew
of
smoke
issuing
from
the
chimney
then
the
girl's
interest
began
to
fasten
itself
upon
the
work
and
she
forgot
everything
else
when
it
was
finished
she
gazed
a
moment
then
whispered
it's
nice
make
a
man
the
artist
erected
a
man
in
the
front
yard
that
resembled
a
derrick
he
could
have
stepped
over
the
house
but
the
girl
was
not
hypercritical
she
was
satisfied
with
the
monster
and
whispered
it's
a
beautiful
man
now
make
me
coming
along
tom
drew
an
hour
glass
with
a
full
moon
and
straw
limbs
to
it
and
armed
the
spreading
fingers
with
a
portentous
fan
the
girl
said
it's
ever
so
nice
i
wish
i
could
draw
it's
easy
whispered
tom
i'll
learn
you
oh
will
you
when
at
noon
do
you
go
home
to
dinner
i'll
stay
if
you
will
good
that's
a
whack
what's
your
name
becky
thatcher
what's
yours
oh
i
know
it's
thomas
sawyer
that's
the
name
they
lick
me
by
i'm
tom
when
i'm
good
you
call
me
tom
will
you
yes
now
tom
began
to
scrawl
something
on
the
slate
hiding
the
words
from
the
girl
but
she
was
not
backward
this
time
she
begged
to
see
tom
said
oh
it
ain't
anything
yes
it
is
no
it
ain't
you
don't
want
to
see
yes
i
do
indeed
i
do
please
let
me
you'll
tell
no
i
won't
deed
and
deed
and
double
deed
won't
you
won't
tell
anybody
at
all
ever
as
long
as
you
live
no
i
won't
ever
tell
any
body
now
let
me
oh
you
don't
want
to
see
now
that
you
treat
me
so
i
will
see
and
she
put
her
small
hand
upon
his
and
a
little
scuffle
ensued
tom
pretending
to
resist
in
earnest
but
letting
his
hand
slip
by
degrees
till
these
words
were
revealed
i
love
you
oh
you
bad
thing
and
she
hit
his
hand
a
smart
rap
but
reddened
and
looked
pleased
nevertheless
just
at
this
juncture
the
boy
felt
a
slow
fateful
grip
closing
on
his
ear
and
a
steady
lifting
impulse
in
that
wise
he
was
borne
across
the
house
and
deposited
in
his
own
seat
under
a
peppering
fire
of
giggles
from
the
whole
school
then
the
master
stood
over
him
during
a
few
awful
moments
and
finally
moved
away
to
his
throne
without
saying
a
word
but
although
tom's
ear
tingled
his
heart
was
jubilant
as
the
school
quieted
down
tom
made
an
honest
effort
to
study
but
the
turmoil
within
him
was
too
great
in
turn
he
took
his
place
in
the
reading
class
and
made
a
botch
of
it
then
in
the
geography
class
and
turned
lakes
into
mountains
mountains
into
rivers
and
rivers
into
continents
till
chaos
was
come
again
then
in
the
spelling
class
and
got
turned
down
by
a
succession
of
mere
baby
words
till
he
brought
up
at
the
foot
and
yielded
up
the
pewter
medal
which
he
had
worn
with
ostentation
for
months
chapter
vii
the
harder
tom
tried
to
fasten
his
mind
on
his
book
the
more
his
ideas
wandered
so
at
last
with
a
sigh
and
a
yawn
he
gave
it
up
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
noon
recess
would
never
come
the
air
was
utterly
dead
there
was
not
a
breath
stirring
it
was
the
sleepiest
of
sleepy
days
the
drowsing
murmur
of
the
five
and
twenty
studying
scholars
soothed
the
soul
like
the
spell
that
is
in
the
murmur
of
bees
away
off
in
the
flaming
sunshine
cardiff
hill
lifted
its
soft
green
sides
through
a
shimmering
veil
of
heat
tinted
with
the
purple
of
distance
a
few
birds
floated
on
lazy
wing
high
in
the
air
no
other
living
thing
was
visible
but
some
cows
and
they
were
asleep
tom's
heart
ached
to
be
free
or
else
to
have
something
of
interest
to
do
to
pass
the
dreary
time
his
hand
wandered
into
his
pocket
and
his
face
lit
up
with
a
glow
of
gratitude
that
was
prayer
though
he
did
not
know
it
then
furtively
the
percussion
cap
box
came
out
he
released
the
tick
and
put
him
on
the
long
flat
desk
the
creature
probably
glowed
with
a
gratitude
that
amounted
to
prayer
too
at
this
moment
but
it
was
premature
for
when
he
started
thankfully
to
travel
off
tom
turned
him
aside
with
a
pin
and
made
him
take
a
new
direction
tom's
bosom
friend
sat
next
him
suffering
just
as
tom
had
been
and
now
he
was
deeply
and
gratefully
interested
in
this
entertainment
in
an
instant
this
bosom
friend
was
joe
harper
the
two
boys
were
sworn
friends
all
the
week
and
embattled
enemies
on
saturdays
joe
took
a
pin
out
of
his
lapel
and
began
to
assist
in
exercising
the
prisoner
the
sport
grew
in
interest
momently
soon
tom
said
that
they
were
interfering
with
each
other
and
neither
getting
the
fullest
benefit
of
the
tick
so
he
put
joe's
slate
on
the
desk
and
drew
a
line
down
the
middle
of
it
from
top
to
bottom
now
said
he
as
long
as
he
is
on
your
side
you
can
stir
him
up
and
i'll
let
him
alone
but
if
you
let
him
get
away
and
get
on
my
side
you're
to
leave
him
alone
as
long
as
i
can
keep
him
from
crossing
over
all
right
go
ahead
start
him
up
the
tick
escaped
from
tom
presently
and
crossed
the
equator
joe
harassed
him
awhile
and
then
he
got
away
and
crossed
back
again
this
change
of
base
occurred
often
while
one
boy
was
worrying
the
tick
with
absorbing
interest
the
other
would
look
on
with
interest
as
strong
the
two
heads
bowed
together
over
the
slate
and
the
two
souls
dead
to
all
things
else
at
last
luck
seemed
to
settle
and
abide
with
joe
the
tick
tried
this
that
and
the
other
course
and
got
as
excited
and
as
anxious
as
the
boys
themselves
but
time
and
again
just
as
he
would
have
victory
in
his
very
grasp
so
to
speak
and
tom's
fingers
would
be
twitching
to
begin
joe's
pin
would
deftly
head
him
off
and
keep
possession
at
last
tom
could
stand
it
no
longer
the
temptation
was
too
strong
so
he
reached
out
and
lent
a
hand
with
his
pin
joe
was
angry
in
a
moment
said
he
tom
you
let
him
alone
i
only
just
want
to
stir
him
up
a
little
joe
no
sir
it
ain't
fair
you
just
let
him
alone
blame
it
i
ain't
going
to
stir
him
much
let
him
alone
i
tell
you
i
won't
you
shall
he's
on
my
side
of
the
line
look
here
joe
harper
whose
is
that
tick
i
don't
care
whose
tick
he
is
he's
on
my
side
of
the
line
and
you
sha'n't
touch
him
well
i'll
just
bet
i
will
though
he's
my
tick
and
i'll
do
what
i
blame
please
with
him
or
die
a
tremendous
whack
came
down
on
tom's
shoulders
and
its
duplicate
on
joe's
and
for
the
space
of
two
minutes
the
dust
continued
to
fly
from
the
two
jackets
and
the
whole
school
to
enjoy
it
the
boys
had
been
too
absorbed
to
notice
the
hush
that
had
stolen
upon
the
school
awhile
before
when
the
master
came
tiptoeing
down
the
room
and
stood
over
them
he
had
contemplated
a
good
part
of
the
performance
before
he
contributed
his
bit
of
variety
to
it
when
school
broke
up
at
noon
tom
flew
to
becky
thatcher
and
whispered
in
her
ear
put
on
your
bonnet
and
let
on
you're
going
home
and
when
you
get
to
the
corner
give
the
rest
of
em
the
slip
and
turn
down
through
the
lane
and
come
back
i'll
go
the
other
way
and
come
it
over
em
the
same
way
so
the
one
went
off
with
one
group
of
scholars
and
the
other
with
another
in
a
little
while
the
two
met
at
the
bottom
of
the
lane
and
when
they
reached
the
school
they
had
it
all
to
themselves
then
they
sat
together
with
a
slate
before
them
and
tom
gave
becky
the
pencil
and
held
her
hand
in
his
guiding
it
and
so
created
another
surprising
house
when
the
interest
in
art
began
to
wane
the
two
fell
to
talking
tom
was
swimming
in
bliss
he
said
do
you
love
rats
no
i
hate
them
well
i
do
too
live
ones
but
i
mean
dead
ones
to
swing
round
your
head
with
a
string
no
i
don't
care
for
rats
much
anyway
what
i
like
is
chewing
gum
oh
i
should
say
so
i
wish
i
had
some
now
do
you
i've
got
some
i'll
let
you
chew
it
awhile
but
you
must
give
it
back
to
me
that
was
agreeable
so
they
chewed
it
turn
about
and
dangled
their
legs
against
the
bench
in
excess
of
contentment
was
you
ever
at
a
circus
said
tom
yes
and
my
pa's
going
to
take
me
again

time

ever
so
easy
becky
hesitating
tom
took
silence
for
consent
and
passed
his
arm
about
her
waist
and
whispered
the
tale
ever
so
softly
with
his
mouth
close
to
her
ear
and
then
he
added
now
you
whisper
it
to
me
just
the
same
she
resisted
for
a
while
and
then
said
you
turn
your
face
away
so
you
can't
see
and
then
i
will
but
you
mustn't
ever
tell
anybody
will

you
won't
will
you
no

won't

becky
he
turned
his
face
away
she
bent
timidly
around
till
her
breath
stirred
his
curls
and
whispered
i
love
you
then
she
sprang
away
and
ran
around
and
around
the
desks
and
benches
with
tom
after
her
and
took
refuge
in
a
corner
at
last
with
her
little
white
apron
to
her
face
tom
clasped
her
about
her
neck
and
pleaded
now
becky
it's
all
done
all
over
but
the
kiss
don't
you
be
afraid
of
that
it
ain't
anything
at
all
please
becky
and
he
tugged
at
her
apron
and
the
hands
by
and
by
she
gave
up
and
let
her
hands
drop
her
face
all
glowing
with
the
struggle
came
up
and
submitted
tom
kissed
the
red
lips
and
said
now
it's
all
done
becky
and
always
after
this
you
know
you
ain't
ever
to
love
anybody
but
me
and
you
ain't
ever
to
marry
anybody
but
me
ever
never
and
forever
will
you
no
i'll
never
love
anybody
but
you
tom
and
i'll
never
marry
anybody
but
you
and
you
ain't
to
ever
marry
anybody
but
me
either
certainly
of
course
that's
part
of
it
and
always
coming
to
school
or
when
we're
going
home
you're
to
walk
with
me
when
there
ain't
anybody
looking
and
you
choose
me
and
i
choose
you
at
parties
because
that's
the
way
you
do
when
you're
engaged
it's
so
nice
i
never
heard
of
it
before
oh
it's
ever
so
gay
why
me
and
amy
lawrence
the
big
eyes
told
tom
his
blunder
and
he
stopped
confused
oh
tom
then
i
ain't
the
first
you've
ever
been
engaged
to
the
child
began
to
cry
tom
said
oh
don't
cry
becky
i
don't
care
for
her
any
more
yes
you
do
tom
you
know
you
do
tom
tried
to
put
his
arm
about
her
neck
but
she
pushed
him
away
and
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
and
went
on
crying
tom
tried
again
with
soothing
words
in
his
mouth
and
was
repulsed
again
then
his
pride
was
up
and
he
strode
away
and
went
outside
he
stood
about
restless
and
uneasy
for
a
while
glancing
at
the
door
every
now
and
then
hoping
she
would
repent
and
come
to
find
him
but
she
did
not
then
he
began
to
feel
badly
and
fear
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
it
was
a
hard
struggle
with
him
to
make
new
advances
now
but
he
nerved
himself
to
it
and
entered
she
was
still
standing
back
there
in
the
corner
sobbing
with
her
face
to
the
wall
tom's
heart
smote
him
he
went
to
her
and
stood
a
moment
not
knowing
exactly
how
to
proceed
then
he
said
hesitatingly
becky
i
i
don't
care
for
anybody
but
you
no
reply
but
sobs
becky
pleadingly
becky
won't
you
say
something
more
sobs
tom
got
out
his
chiefest
jewel
a
brass
knob
from
the
top
of
an
andiron
and
passed
it
around
her
so
that
she
could
see
it
and
said
please
becky
won't
you
take
it
she
struck
it
to
the
floor
then
tom
marched
out
of
the
house
and
over
the
hills
and
far
away
to
return
to
school
no
more
that
day
presently
becky
began
to
suspect
she
ran
to
the
door
he
was
not
in
sight
she
flew
around
to
the
play
yard
he
was
not
there
then
she
called
tom
come
back
tom
she
listened
intently
but
there
was
no
answer
she
had
no
companions
but
silence
and
loneliness
so
she
sat
down
to
cry
again
and
upbraid
herself
and
by
this
time
the
scholars
began
to
gather
again
and
she
had
to
hide
her
griefs
and
still
her
broken
heart
and
take
up
the
cross
of
a
long
dreary
aching
afternoon
with
none
among
the
strangers
about
her
to
exchange
sorrows
with
chapter
viii
tom
dodged
hither
and
thither
through
lanes
until
he
was
well
out
of
the
track
of
returning
scholars
and
then
fell
into
a
moody
jog
he
crossed
a
small
branch
two
or
three
times
because
of
a
prevailing
juvenile
superstition
that
to
cross
water
baffled
pursuit
half
an
hour
later
he
was
disappearing
behind
the
douglas
mansion
on
the
summit
of
cardiff
hill
and
the
school
house
was
hardly
distinguishable
away
off
in
the
valley
behind
him
he
entered
a
dense
wood
picked
his
pathless
way
to
the
centre
of
it
and
sat
down
on
a
mossy
spot
under
a
spreading
oak
there
was
not
even
a
zephyr
stirring
the
dead
noonday
heat
had
even
stilled
the
songs
of
the
birds
nature
lay
in
a
trance
that
was
broken
by
no
sound
but
the
occasional
far
off
hammering
of
a
wood
pecker
and
this
seemed
to
render
the
pervading
silence
and
sense
of
loneliness
the
more
profound
the
boy's
soul
was
steeped
in
melancholy
his
feelings
were
in
happy
accord
with
his
surroundings
he
sat
long
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
chin
in
his
hands
meditating
it
seemed
to
him
that
life
was
but
a
trouble
at
best
and
he
more
than
half
envied
jimmy
hodges
so
lately
released
it
must
be
very
peaceful
he
thought
to
lie
and
slumber
and
dream
forever
and
ever
with
the
wind
whispering
through
the
trees
and
caressing
the
grass
and
the
flowers
over
the
grave
and
nothing
to
bother
and
grieve
about
ever
any
more
if
he
only
had
a
clean
sunday
school
record
he
could
be
willing
to
go
and
be
done
with
it
all
now
as
to
this
girl
what
had
he
done
nothing
he
had
meant
the
best
in
the
world
and
been
treated
like
a
dog
like
a
very
dog
she
would
be
sorry
some
day
maybe
when
it
was
too
late
ah
if
he
could
only
die
temporarily
but
the
elastic
heart
of
youth
cannot
be
compressed
into
one
constrained
shape
long
at
a
time
tom
presently
began
to
drift
insensibly
back
into
the
concerns
of
this
life
again
what
if
he
turned
his
back
now
and
disappeared
mysteriously
what
if
he
went
away
ever
so
far
away
into
unknown
countries
beyond
the
seas
and
never
came
back
any
more
how
would
she
feel
then
the
idea
of
being
a
clown
recurred
to
him
now
only
to
fill
him
with
disgust
for
frivolity
and
jokes
and
spotted
tights
were
an
offense
when
they
intruded
themselves
upon
a
spirit
that
was
exalted
into
the
vague
august
realm
of
the
romantic
no
he
would
be
a
soldier
and
return
after
long
years
all
war
worn
and
illustrious
no
better
still
he
would
join
the
indians
and
hunt
buffaloes
and
go
on
the
warpath
in
the
mountain
ranges
and
the
trackless
great
plains
of
the
far
west
and
away
in
the
future
come
back
a
great
chief
bristling
with
feathers
hideous
with
paint
and
prance
into
sunday
school
some
drowsy
summer
morning
with
a
blood
curdling
war
whoop
and
sear
the
eyeballs
of
all
his
companions
with
unappeasable
envy
but
no
there
was
something
gaudier
even
than
this
he
would
be
a
pirate
that
was
it
now
his
future
lay
plain
before
him
and
glowing
with
unimaginable
splendor
how
his
name
would
fill
the
world
and
make
people
shudder
how
gloriously
he
would
go
plowing
the
dancing
seas
in
his
long
low
black
hulled
racer
the
spirit
of
the
storm
with
his
grisly
flag
flying
at
the
fore
and
at
the
zenith
of
his
fame
how
he
would
suddenly
appear
at
the
old
village
and
stalk
into
church
brown
and
weather
beaten
in
his
black
velvet
doublet
and
trunks
his
great
jack
boots
his
crimson
sash
his
belt
bristling
with
horse
pistols
his
crime
rusted
cutlass
at
his
side
his
slouch
hat
with
waving
plumes
his
black
flag
unfurled
with
the
skull
and
crossbones
on
it
and
hear
with
swelling
ecstasy
the
whisperings
it's
tom
sawyer
the
pirate
the
black
avenger
of
the
spanish
main
yes
it
was
settled
his
career
was
determined
he
would
run
away
from
home
and
enter
upon
it
he
would
start
the
very
next
morning
therefore
he
must
now
begin
to
get
ready
he
would
collect
his
resources
together
he
went
to
a
rotten
log
near
at
hand
and
began
to
dig
under
one
end
of
it
with
his
barlow
knife
he
soon
struck
wood
that
sounded
hollow
he
put
his
hand
there
and
uttered
this
incantation
impressively
what
hasn't
come
here
come
what's
here
stay
here
then
he
scraped
away
the
dirt
and
exposed
a
pine
shingle
he
took
it
up
and
disclosed
a
shapely
little
treasure
house
whose
bottom
and
sides
were
of
shingles
in
it
lay
a
marble
tom's
astonishment
was
bound
less
he
scratched
his
head
with
a
perplexed
air
and
said
well
that
beats
anything
then
he
tossed
the
marble
away
pettishly
and
stood
cogitating
the
truth
was
that
a
superstition
of
his
had
failed
here
which
he
and
all
his
comrades
had
always
looked
upon
as
infallible
if
you
buried
a
marble
with
certain
necessary
incantations
and
left
it
alone
a
fortnight
and
then
opened
the
place
with
the
incantation
he
had
just
used
you
would
find
that
all
the
marbles
you
had
ever
lost
had
gathered
themselves
together
there
meantime
no
matter
how
widely
they
had
been
separated
but
now
this
thing
had
actually
and
unquestionably
failed
tom's
whole
structure
of
faith
was
shaken
to
its
foundations
he
had
many
a
time
heard
of
this
thing
succeeding
but
never
of
its
failing
before
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
he
had
tried
it
several
times
before
himself
but
could
never
find
the
hiding
places
afterward
he
puzzled
over
the
matter
some
time
and
finally
decided
that
some
witch
had
interfered
and
broken
the
charm
he
thought
he
would
satisfy
himself
on
that
point
so
he
searched
around
till
he
found
a
small
sandy
spot
with
a
little
funnel
shaped
depression
in
it
he
laid
himself
down
and
put
his
mouth
close
to
this
depression
and
called
doodle
bug
doodle
bug
tell
me
what
i
want
to
know
doodle
bug
doodle
bug
tell
me
what
i
want
to
know
the
sand
began
to
work
and
presently
a
small
black
bug
appeared
for
a
second
and
then
darted
under
again
in
a
fright
he
dasn't
tell
so
it
was
a
witch
that
done
it
i
just
knowed
it
he
well
knew
the
futility
of
trying
to
contend
against
witches
so
he
gave
up
discouraged
but
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
as
well
have
the
marble
he
had
just
thrown
away
and
therefore
he
went
and
made
a
patient
search
for
it
but
he
could
not
find
it
now
he
went
back
to
his
treasure
house
and
carefully
placed
himself
just
as
he
had
been
standing
when
he
tossed
the
marble
away
then
he
took
another
marble
from
his
pocket
and
tossed
it
in
the
same
way
saying
brother
go
find
your
brother
he
watched
where
it
stopped
and
went
there
and
looked
but
it
must
have
fallen
short
or
gone
too
far
so
he
tried
twice
more
the
last
repetition
was
successful
the
two
marbles
lay
within
a
foot
of
each
other
just
here
the
blast
of
a
toy
tin
trumpet
came
faintly
down
the
green
aisles
of
the
forest
tom
flung
off
his
jacket
and
trousers
turned
a
suspender
into
a
belt
raked
away
some
brush
behind
the
rotten
log
disclosing
a
rude
bow
and
arrow
a
lath
sword
and
a
tin
trumpet
and
in
a
moment
had
seized
these
things
and
bounded
away
barelegged
with
fluttering
shirt
he
presently
halted
under
a
great
elm
blew
an
answering
blast
and
then
began
to
tiptoe
and
look
warily
out
this
way
and
that
he
said
cautiously
to
an
imaginary
company
hold
my
merry
men
keep
hid
till
i
blow
now
appeared
joe
harper
as
airily
clad
and
elaborately
armed
as
tom
tom
called
hold
who
comes
here
into
sherwood
forest
without
my
pass
guy
of
guisborne
wants
no
man's
pass
who
art
thou
that
that
dares
to
hold
such
language
said
tom
prompting
for
they
talked
by
the
book
from
memory
who
art
thou
that
dares
to
hold
such
language
i
indeed
i
am
robin
hood
as
thy
caitiff
carcase
soon
shall
know
then
art
thou
indeed
that
famous
outlaw
right
gladly
will
i
dispute
with
thee
the
passes
of
the
merry
wood
have
at
thee
they
took
their
lath
swords
dumped
their
other
traps
on
the
ground
struck
a
fencing
attitude
foot
to
foot
and
began
a
grave
careful
combat
two
up
and
two
down
presently
tom
said
now
if
you've
got
the
hang
go
it
lively
so
they
went
it
lively
panting
and
perspiring
with
the
work
by
and
by
tom
shouted
fall
fall
why
don't
you
fall
i
sha'n't
why
don't
you
fall
yourself
you're
getting
the
worst
of
it
why
that
ain't
anything
i
can't
fall
that
ain't
the
way
it
is
in
the
book
the
book
says
then
with
one
back
handed
stroke
he
slew
poor
guy
of
guisborne
you're
to
turn
around
and
let
me
hit
you
in
the
back
there
was
no
getting
around
the
authorities
so
joe
turned
received
the
whack
and
fell
now
said
joe
getting
up
you
got
to
let
me
kill
you
that's
fair
why
i
can't
do
that
it
ain't
in
the
book
well
it's
blamed
mean
that's
all
well
say
joe
you
can
be
friar
tuck
or
much
the
miller's
son
and
lam
me
with
a
quarter
staff
or
i'll
be
the
sheriff
of
nottingham
and
you
be
robin
hood
a
little
while
and
kill
me
this
was
satisfactory
and
so
these
adventures
were
carried
out
then
tom
became
robin
hood
again
and
was
allowed
by
the
treacherous
nun
to
bleed
his
strength
away
through
his
neglected
wound
and
at
last
joe
representing
a
whole
tribe
of
weeping
outlaws
dragged
him
sadly
forth
gave
his
bow
into
his
feeble
hands
and
tom
said
where
this
arrow
falls
there
bury
poor
robin
hood
under
the
greenwood
tree
then
he
shot
the
arrow
and
fell
back
and
would
have
died
but
he
lit
on
a
nettle
and
sprang
up
too
gaily
for
a
corpse
the
boys
dressed
themselves
hid
their
accoutrements
and
went
off
grieving
that
there
were
no
outlaws
any
more
and
wondering
what
modern
civilization
could
claim
to
have
done
to
compensate
for
their
loss
they
said
they
would
rather
be
outlaws
a
year
in
sherwood
forest
than
president
of
the
united
states
forever
chapter
ix
at
half
past
nine
that
night
tom
and
sid
were
sent
to
bed
as
usual
they
said
their
prayers
and
sid
was
soon
asleep
tom
lay
awake
and
waited
in
restless
impatience
when
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
must
be
nearly
daylight
he
heard
the
clock
strike
ten
this
was
despair
he
would
have
tossed
and
fidgeted
as
his
nerves
demanded
but
he
was
afraid
he
might
wake
sid
so
he
lay
still
and
stared
up
into
the
dark
everything
was
dismally
still
by
and
by
out
of
the
stillness
little
scarcely
perceptible
noises
began
to
emphasize
themselves
the
ticking
of
the
clock
began
to
bring
itself
into
notice
old
beams
began
to
crack
mysteriously
the
stairs
creaked
faintly
evidently
spirits
were
abroad
a
measured
muffled
snore
issued
from
aunt
polly's
chamber
and
now
the
tiresome
chirping
of
a
cricket
that
no
human
ingenuity
could
locate
began
next
the
ghastly
ticking
of
a
death
watch
in
the
wall
at
the
bed's
head
made
tom
shudder
it
meant
that
somebody's
days
were
numbered
then
the
howl
of
a
far
off
dog
rose
on
the
night
air
and
was
answered
by
a
fainter
howl
from
a
remoter
distance
tom
was
in
an
agony
at
last
he
was
satisfied
that
time
had
ceased
and
eternity
begun
he
began
to
doze
in
spite
of
himself
the
clock
chimed
eleven
but
he
did
not
hear
it
and
then
there
came
mingling
with
his
half
formed
dreams
a
most
melancholy
caterwauling
the
raising
of
a
neighboring
window
disturbed
him
a
cry
of
scat
you
devil
and
the
crash
of
an
empty
bottle
against
the
back
of
his
aunt's
woodshed
brought
him
wide
awake
and
a
single
minute
later
he
was
dressed
and
out
of
the
window
and
creeping
along
the
roof
of
the
ell
on
all
fours
he
meow'd
with
caution
once
or
twice
as
he
went
then
jumped
to
the
roof
of
the
woodshed
and
thence
to
the
ground
huckleberry
finn
was
there
with
his
dead
cat
the
boys
moved
off
and
disappeared
in
the
gloom
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
they
were
wading
through
the
tall
grass
of
the
graveyard
it
was
a
graveyard
of
the
old
fashioned
western
kind
it
was
on
a
hill
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
village
it
had
a
crazy
board
fence
around
it
which
leaned
inward
in
places
and
outward
the
rest
of
the
time
but
stood
upright
nowhere
grass
and
weeds
grew
rank
over
the
whole
cemetery
all
the
old
graves
were
sunken
in
there
was
not
a
tombstone
on
the
place
round
topped
worm
eaten
boards
staggered
over
the
graves
leaning
for
support
and
finding
none
sacred
to
the
memory
of
so
and
so
had
been
painted
on
them
once
but
it
could
no
longer
have
been
read
on
the
most
of
them
now
even
if
there
had
been
light
a
faint
wind
moaned
through
the
trees
and
tom
feared
it
might
be
the
spirits
of
the
dead
complaining
at
being
disturbed
the
boys
talked
little
and
only
under
their
breath
for
the
time
and
the
place
and
the
pervading
solemnity
and
silence
oppressed
their
spirits
they
found
the
sharp
new
heap
they
were
seeking
and
ensconced
themselves
within
the
protection
of
three
great
elms
that
grew
in
a
bunch
within
a
few
feet
of
the
grave
then
they
waited
in
silence
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
the
hooting
of
a
distant
owl
was
all
the
sound
that
troubled
the
dead
stillness
tom's
reflections
grew
oppressive
he
must
force
some
talk
so
he
said
in
a
whisper
hucky
do
you
believe
the
dead
people
like
it
for
us
to
be
here
huckleberry
whispered
i
wisht
i
knowed
it's
awful
solemn
like
ain't
it
i
bet
it
is
there
was
a
considerable
pause
while
the
boys
canvassed
this
matter
inwardly
then
tom
whispered
say
hucky
do
you
reckon
hoss
williams
hears
us
talking
o
course
he
does
least
his
sperrit
does
tom
after
a
pause
i
wish
i'd
said
mister
williams
but
i
never
meant
any
harm
everybody
calls
him
hoss
a
body
can't
be
too
partic'lar
how
they
talk
bout
these
yer
dead
people
tom
this
was
a
damper
and
conversation
died
again
presently
tom
seized
his
comrade's
arm
and
said
sh
what
is
it
tom
and
the
two
clung
together
with
beating
hearts
sh
there
tis
again
didn't
you
hear
it
i
there
now
you
hear
it
lord
tom

the
dark

come
oh

afeard
i
don't
believe
they'll
bother
us
we
ain't
doing
any
harm
if
we
keep
perfectly
still
maybe
they
won't
notice
us
at
all
i'll
try
to
tom
but
lord
i'm
all
of
a
shiver
listen
the
boys
bent
their
heads
together
and
scarcely
breathed
a
muffled
sound
of
voices
floated
up
from
the
far
end
of
the
graveyard
look
see
there
whispered
tom
what
is
it
it's
devil
fire
oh
tom
this
is
awful
some
vague
figures
approached
through
the
gloom
swinging
an
old
fashioned
tin
lantern
that
freckled
the
ground
with
innumerable
little
spangles
of
light
presently
huckleberry
whispered
with
a
shudder
it's
the
devils
sure
enough
three
of
em
lordy
tom

goners

that's
so
that
murderin
half
breed
i'd
druther
they
was
devils
a
dern
sight
what
kin
they
be
up
to
the
whisper
died
wholly
out
now
for
the
three
men
had
reached
the
grave
and
stood
within
a
few
feet
of
the
boys
hiding
place
here
it
is
said
the
third
voice
and
the
owner
of
it
held
the
lantern
up
and
revealed
the
face
of
young
doctor
robinson
potter
and
injun
joe
were
carrying
a
handbarrow
with
a
rope
and
a
couple
of
shovels
on
it
they
cast
down
their
load
and
began
to
open
the
grave
the
doctor
put
the
lantern
at
the
head
of
the
grave
and
came
and
sat
down
with
his
back
against
one
of
the
elm
trees
he
was
so
close
the
boys
could
have
touched
him
hurry
men
he
said
in
a
low
voice
the
moon
might
come
out
at
any
moment
they
growled
a
response
and
went
on
digging
for
some
time
there
was
no
noise
but
the
grating
sound
of
the
spades
discharging
their
freight
of
mould
and
gravel
it
was
very
monotonous
finally
a
spade
struck
upon
the
coffin
with
a
dull
woody
accent
and
within
another
minute
or
two
the
men
had
hoisted
it
out
on
the
ground
they
pried
off
the
lid
with
their
shovels
got
out
the
body
and
dumped
it
rudely
on
the
ground
the
moon
drifted
from
behind
the
clouds
and
exposed
the
pallid
face
the
barrow
was
got
ready
and
the
corpse
placed
on
it
covered
with
a
blanket
and
bound
to
its
place
with
the
rope
potter
took
out
a
large
spring
knife
and
cut
off
the
dangling
end
of
the
rope
and
then
said
now
the
cussed
thing's
ready
sawbones
and
you'll
just
out
with
another
five
or
here
she
stays
that's
the
talk
said
injun
joe
look
here
what
does
this
mean
said
the
doctor
you
required
your
pay
in
advance
and
i've
paid
you
yes
and
you
done
more
than
that
said
injun
joe
approaching
the
doctor
who
was
now
standing
five
years
ago
you
drove
me
away
from
your
father's
kitchen
one
night
when
i
come
to
ask
for
something
to
eat
and
you
said
i
warn't
there
for
any
good
and
when
i
swore
i'd
get
even
with
you
if
it
took
a
hundred
years
your
father
had
me
jailed
for
a
vagrant
did
you
think
i'd
forget
the
injun
blood
ain't
in
me
for
nothing
and
now
i've
got
you
and
you
got
to
settle
you
know
he
was
threatening
the
doctor
with
his
fist
in
his
face
by
this
time
the
doctor
struck
out
suddenly
and
stretched
the
ruffian
on
the
ground
potter
dropped
his
knife
and
exclaimed
here
now
don't
you
hit
my
pard
and
the
next
moment
he
had
grappled
with
the
doctor
and
the
two
were
struggling
with
might
and
main
trampling
the
grass
and
tearing
the
ground
with
their
heels
injun
joe
sprang
to
his
feet
his
eyes
flaming
with
passion
snatched
up
potter's
knife
and
went
creeping
catlike
and
stooping
round
and
round
about
the
combatants
seeking
an
opportunity
all
at
once
the
doctor
flung
himself
free
seized
the
heavy
headboard
of
williams
grave
and
felled
potter
to
the
earth
with
it
and
in
the
same
instant
the
half
breed
saw
his
chance
and
drove
the
knife
to
the
hilt
in
the
young
man's
breast
he
reeled
and
fell
partly
upon
potter
flooding
him
with
his
blood
and
in
the
same
moment
the
clouds
blotted
out
the
dreadful
spectacle
and
the
two
frightened
boys
went
speeding
away
in
the
dark
presently
when
the
moon
emerged
again
injun
joe
was
standing
over
the
two
forms
contemplating
them
the
doctor
murmured
inarticulately
gave
a
long
gasp
or
two
and
was
still
the
half
breed
muttered
that
score
is
settled
damn
you
then
he
robbed
the
body
after
which
he
put
the
fatal
knife
in
potter's
open
right
hand
and
sat
down
on
the
dismantled
coffin
three
four
five
minutes
passed
and
then
potter
began
to
stir
and
moan
his
hand
closed
upon
the
knife
he
raised
it
glanced
at
it
and
let
it
fall
with
a
shudder
then
he
sat
up
pushing
the
body
from
him
and
gazed
at
it
and
then
around
him
confusedly
his
eyes
met
joe's
lord
how
is
this
joe
he
said
it's
a
dirty
business
said
joe
without
moving
what
did
you
do
it
for
i
i
never
done
it
look
here
that
kind
of
talk
won't
wash
potter
trembled
and
grew
white
i
thought
i'd
got
sober
i'd
no
business
to
drink
to
night
but
it's
in
my
head
yet
worse'n
when
we
started
here
i'm
all
in
a
muddle
can't
recollect
anything
of
it
hardly
tell
me
joe
honest
now
old
feller
did
i
do
it
joe
i
never
meant
to
pon
my
soul
and
honor
i
never
meant
to
joe
tell
me
how
it
was
joe
oh
it's
awful
and
him
so
young
and
promising
why
you
two
was
scuffling
and
he
fetched
you
one
with
the
headboard
and
you
fell
flat
and
then
up
you
come
all
reeling
and
staggering
like
and
snatched
the
knife
and
jammed
it
into
him
just
as
he
fetched
you
another
awful
clip
and
here
you've
laid
as
dead
as
a
wedge
til
now
oh
i
didn't
know
what
i
was
a
doing
i
wish
i
may
die
this
minute
if
i
did
it
was
all
on
account
of
the
whiskey
and
the
excitement
i
reckon
i
never
used
a
weepon
in
my
life
before
joe
i've
fought
but
never
with
weepons
they'll
all
say
that
joe
don't
tell
say
you
won't
tell
joe
that's
a
good
feller
i
always
liked
you
joe
and
stood
up
for
you
too
don't
you
remember
you
won't
tell
will
you
joe
and
the
poor
creature
dropped
on
his
knees
before
the
stolid
murderer
and
clasped
his
appealing
hands
no
you've
always
been
fair
and
square
with
me
muff
potter
and
i
won't
go
back
on
you
there
now
that's
as
fair
as
a
man
can
say
oh
joe
you're
an
angel
i'll
bless
you
for
this
the
longest
day
i
live
and
potter
began
to
cry
come
now
that's
enough
of
that
this
ain't
any
time
for
blubbering
you
be
off
yonder
way
and
i'll
go
this
move
now
and
don't
leave
any
tracks
behind
you
potter
started
on
a
trot
that
quickly
increased
to
a
run
the
half
breed
stood
looking
after
him
he
muttered
if
he's
as
much
stunned
with
the
lick
and
fuddled
with
the
rum
as
he
had
the
look
of
being
he
won't
think
of
the
knife
till
he's
gone
so
far
he'll
be
afraid
to
come
back
after
it
to
such
a
place
by
himself
chicken
heart
two
or
three
minutes
later
the
murdered
man
the
blanketed
corpse
the
lidless
coffin
and
the
open
grave
were
under
no
inspection
but
the
moon's
the
stillness
was
complete
again
too
chapter
x
the
two
boys
flew
on
and
on
toward
the
village
speechless
with
horror
they
glanced
backward
over
their
shoulders
from
time
to
time
apprehensively
as
if
they
feared
they
might
be
followed
every
stump
that
started
up
in
their
path
seemed
a
man
and
an
enemy
and
made
them
catch
their
breath
and
as
they
sped
by
some
outlying
cottages
that
lay
near
the
village
the
barking
of
the
aroused
watch
dogs
seemed
to
give
wings
to
their
feet
if
we
can
only
get
to
the
old
tannery
before
we
break
down
whispered
tom
in
short
catches
between
breaths
i
can't
stand
it
much
longer
huckleberry's
hard
pantings
were
his
only
reply
and
the
boys
fixed
their
eyes
on
the
goal
of
their
hopes
and
bent
to
their
work
to
win
it
they
gained
steadily
on
it
and
at
last
breast
to
breast
they
burst
through
the
open
door
and
fell
grateful
and
exhausted
in
the
sheltering
shadows
beyond
by
and
by
their
pulses
slowed
down
and
tom
whispered
huckleberry
what
do
you
reckon'll
come
of
this
if
doctor
robinson
dies
i
reckon
hanging'll
come
of
it
do
you
though
why
i
know
it
tom
tom
thought
a
while
then
he
said
who'll
tell
we
what
are
you
talking
about
s'pose
something
happened
and
injun
joe
didn't
hang
why
he'd
kill
us
some
time
or
other
just
as
dead
sure
as
we're
a
laying
here
that's
just
what
i
was
thinking
to
myself
huck
if
anybody
tells
let
muff
potter
do
it
if
he's
fool
enough
he's
generally
drunk
enough
tom
said
nothing
went
on
thinking
presently
he
whispered
huck
muff
potter
don't
know
it
how
can
he
tell
what's
the
reason
he
don't
know
it
because
he'd
just
got
that
whack
when
injun
joe
done
it
d'you
reckon
he
could
see
anything
d'you
reckon
he
knowed
anything
by
hokey
that's
so
tom
and
besides
look
a
here
maybe
that
whack
done
for
him
no
taint
likely
tom
he
had
liquor
in
him
i
could
see
that
and
besides
he
always
has
well
when
pap's
full
you
might
take
and
belt
him
over
the
head
with
a
church
and
you
couldn't
phase
him
he
says
so
his
own
self
so
it's
the
same
with
muff
potter
of
course
but
if
a
man
was
dead
sober
i
reckon
maybe
that
whack
might
fetch
him
i
dono
after
another
reflective
silence
tom
said
hucky
you
sure
you
can
keep
mum
tom
we
got
to
keep
mum
you
know
that
that
injun
devil
wouldn't
make
any
more
of
drownding
us
than
a
couple
of
cats
if
we
was
to
squeak
bout
this
and
they
didn't
hang
him
now
look
a
here
tom
less
take
and
swear
to
one
another
that's
what
we
got
to
do
swear
to
keep
mum
i'm
agreed
it's
the
best
thing
would
you
just
hold
hands
and
swear
that
we
oh
no
that
wouldn't
do
for
this
that's
good
enough
for
little
rubbishy
common
things
specially
with
gals
cuz
they
go
back
on
you
anyway
and
blab
if
they
get
in
a
huff
but
there
orter
be
writing
bout
a
big
thing
like
this
and
blood
tom's
whole
being
applauded
this
idea
it
was
deep
and
dark
and
awful
the
hour
the
circumstances
the
surroundings
were
in
keeping
with
it
he
picked
up
a
clean
pine
shingle
that
lay
in
the
moon
light
took
a
little
fragment
of
red
keel
out
of
his
pocket
got
the
moon
on
his
work
and
painfully
scrawled
these
lines
emphasizing
each
slow
down
stroke
by
clamping
his
tongue
between
his
teeth
and
letting
up
the
pressure
on
the
up
strokes
next
page
huck
finn
and
tom
sawyer
swears
they
will
keep
mum
about
this
and
they
wish
they
may
drop
down
dead
in
their
tracks
if
they
ever
tell
and
rot
huckleberry
was
filled
with
admiration
of
tom's
facility
in
writing
and
the
sublimity
of
his
language
he
at
once
took
a
pin
from
his
lapel
and
was
going
to
prick
his
flesh
but
tom
said
hold
on
don't
do
that
a
pin's
brass
it
might
have
verdigrease
on
it
what's
verdigrease
it's
p'ison
that's
what
it
is
you
just
swaller
some
of
it
once
you'll
see
so
tom
unwound
the
thread
from
one
of
his
needles
and
each
boy
pricked
the
ball
of
his
thumb
and
squeezed
out
a
drop
of
blood
in
time
after
many
squeezes
tom
managed
to
sign
his
initials
using
the
ball
of
his
little
finger
for
a
pen
then
he
showed
huckleberry
how
to
make
an
h
and
an
f
and
the
oath
was
complete
they
buried
the
shingle
close
to
the
wall
with
some
dismal
ceremonies
and
incantations
and
the
fetters
that
bound
their
tongues
were
considered
to
be
locked
and
the
key
thrown
away
a
figure
crept
stealthily
through
a
break
in
the
other
end
of
the
ruined
building
now
but
they
did
not
notice
it
tom
whispered
huckleberry
does
this
keep
us
from
ever
telling
always
of
course
it
does
it
don't
make
any
difference
what
happens
we
got
to
keep
mum
we'd
drop
down
dead
don't
you
know
that
yes
i
reckon
that's
so
they
continued
to
whisper
for
some
little
time
presently
a
dog
set
up
a
long
lugubrious
howl
just
outside
within
ten
feet
of
them
the
boys
clasped
each
other
suddenly
in
an
agony
of
fright
which
of
us
does
he
mean
gasped
huckleberry
i
dono
peep
through
the
crack
quick
no
you
tom
i
can't
i
can't
do
it
huck
please
tom
there
tis
again
oh
lordy
i'm
thankful
whispered
tom
i
know
his
voice
it's
bull
harbison
if
mr
harbison
owned
a
slave
named
bull
tom
would
have
spoken
of
him
as
harbison's
bull
but
a
son
or
a
dog
of
that
name
was
bull
harbison
oh
that's
good
i
tell
you
tom
i
was
most
scared
to
death
i'd
a
bet
anything
it
was
a
stray
dog
the
dog
howled
again
the
boys
hearts
sank
once
more
oh
my
that
ain't
no
bull
harbison
whispered
huckleberry
do
tom
tom
quaking
with
fear
yielded
and
put
his
eye
to
the
crack
his
whisper
was
hardly
audible
when
he
said
oh
huck
its
a
stray
dog
quick
tom
quick
who
does
he
mean
huck
he
must
mean
us
both
we're
right
together
oh
tom
i
reckon
we're
goners
i
reckon
there
ain't
no
mistake
bout
where
i'll
go
to
i
been
so
wicked
dad
fetch
it
this
comes
of
playing
hookey
and
doing
everything
a
feller's
told
not
to
do
i
might
a
been
good
like
sid
if
i'd
a
tried
but
no
i
wouldn't
of
course
but
if
ever
i
get
off
this
time
i
lay
i'll
just
waller
in
sunday
schools
and
tom
began
to
snuffle
a
little
you
bad
and
huckleberry
began
to
snuffle
too
consound
it
tom
sawyer
you're
just
old
pie
long
side
o
what
i
am
oh
lordy
lordy
lordy
i
wisht
i
only
had
half
your
chance
tom
choked
off
and
whispered
look
hucky
look
he's
got
his
back
to
us
hucky
looked
with
joy
in
his
heart
well
he
has
by
jingoes
did
he
before
yes
he
did
but
i
like
a
fool
never
thought
oh
this
is
bully
you
know
now
who
can
he
mean
the
howling
stopped
tom
pricked
up
his
ears
sh
what's
that
he
whispered
sounds
like
like
hogs
grunting
no
it's
somebody
snoring
tom
that
is
it
where
bouts
is
it
huck
i
bleeve
it's
down
at
tother
end
sounds
so
anyway
pap
used
to
sleep
there
sometimes
long
with
the
hogs
but
laws
bless
you
he
just
lifts
things
when
he
snores
besides
i
reckon
he
ain't
ever
coming
back
to
this
town
any
more
the
spirit
of
adventure
rose
in
the
boys
souls
once
more
hucky
do
you
das't
to
go
if
i
lead
i
don't
like
to
much
tom
s'pose
it's
injun
joe
tom
quailed
but
presently
the
temptation
rose
up
strong
again
and
the
boys
agreed
to
try
with
the
understanding
that
they
would
take
to
their
heels
if
the
snoring
stopped
so
they
went
tiptoeing
stealthily
down
the
one
behind
the
other
when
they
had
got
to
within
five
steps
of
the
snorer
tom
stepped
on
a
stick
and
it
broke
with
a
sharp
snap
the
man
moaned
writhed
a
little
and
his
face
came
into
the
moonlight
it
was
muff
potter
the
boys
hearts
had
stood
still
and
their
hopes
too
when
the
man
moved
but
their
fears
passed
away
now
they
tip
toed
out
through
the
broken
weather
boarding
and
stopped
at
a
little
distance
to
exchange
a
parting
word
that
long
lugubrious
howl
rose
on
the
night
air
again
they
turned
and
saw
the
strange
dog
standing
within
a
few
feet
of
where
potter
was
lying
and
facing
potter
with
his
nose
pointing
heavenward
oh
geeminy
it's
him
exclaimed
both
boys
in
a
breath
say
tom
they
say
a
stray
dog
come
howling
around
johnny
miller's
house
bout
midnight
as
much
as
two
weeks
ago
and
a
whippoorwill
come
in
and
lit
on
the
banisters
and
sung
the
very
same
evening
and
there
ain't
anybody
dead
there
yet
well
i
know
that
and
suppose
there
ain't
didn't
gracie
miller
fall
in
the
kitchen
fire
and
burn
herself
terrible
the
very
next
saturday
yes
but
she
ain't
dead
and
what's
more
she's
getting
better
too
all
right
you
wait
and
see
she's
a
goner
just
as
dead
sure
as
muff
potter's
a
goner
that's
what
the
niggers
say
and
they
know
all
about
these
kind
of
things
huck
then
they
separated
cogitating
when
tom
crept
in
at
his
bedroom
window
the
night
was
almost
spent
he
undressed
with
excessive
caution
and
fell
asleep
congratulating
himself
that
nobody
knew
of
his
escapade
he
was
not
aware
that
the
gently
snoring
sid
was
awake
and
had
been
so
for
an
hour
when
tom
awoke
sid
was
dressed
and
gone
there
was
a
late
look
in
the
light
a
late
sense
in
the
atmosphere
he
was
startled
why
had
he
not
been
called
persecuted
till
he
was
up
as
usual
the
thought
filled
him
with
bodings
within
five
minutes
he
was
dressed
and
down
stairs
feeling
sore
and
drowsy
the
family
were
still
at
table
but
they
had
finished
breakfast
there
was
no
voice
of
rebuke
but
there
were
averted
eyes
there
was
a
silence
and
an
air
of
solemnity
that
struck
a
chill
to
the
culprit's
heart
he
sat
down
and
tried
to
seem
gay
but
it
was
up
hill
work
it
roused
no
smile
no
response
and
he
lapsed
into
silence
and
let
his
heart
sink
down
to
the
depths
after
breakfast
his
aunt
took
him
aside
and
tom
almost
brightened
in
the
hope
that
he
was
going
to
be
flogged
but
it
was
not
so
his
aunt
wept
over
him
and
asked
him
how
he
could
go
and
break
her
old
heart
so
and
finally
told
him
to
go
on
and
ruin
himself
and
bring
her
gray
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
for
it
was
no
use
for
her
to
try
any
more
this
was
worse
than
a
thousand
whippings
and
tom's
heart
was
sorer
now
than
his
body
he
cried
he
pleaded
for
forgiveness
promised
to
reform
over
and
over
again
and
then
received
his
dismissal
feeling
that
he
had
won
but
an
imperfect
forgiveness
and
established
but
a
feeble
confidence
he
left
the
presence
too
miserable
to
even
feel
revengeful
toward
sid
and
so
the
latter's
prompt
retreat
through
the
back
gate
was
unnecessary
he
moped
to
school
gloomy
and
sad
and
took
his
flogging
along
with
joe
harper
for
playing
hookey
the
day
before
with
the
air
of
one
whose
heart
was
busy
with
heavier
woes
and
wholly
dead
to
trifles
then
he
betook
himself
to
his
seat
rested
his
elbows
on
his
desk
and
his
jaws
in
his
hands
and
stared
at
the
wall
with
the
stony
stare
of
suffering
that
has
reached
the
limit
and
can
no
further
go
his
elbow
was
pressing
against
some
hard
substance
after
a
long
time
he
slowly
and
sadly
changed
his
position
and
took
up
this
object
with
a
sigh
it
was
in
a
paper
he
unrolled
it
a
long
lingering
colossal
sigh
followed
and
his
heart
broke
it
was
his
brass
andiron
knob
this
final
feather
broke
the
camel's
back
chapter
xi
close
upon
the
hour
of
noon
the
whole
village
was
suddenly
electrified
with
the
ghastly
news
no
need
of
the
as
yet
un
dreamed
of
telegraph
the
tale
flew
from
man
to
man
from
group
to
group
from
house
to
house
with
little
less
than
telegraphic
speed
of
course
the
schoolmaster
gave
holi
day
for
that
afternoon
the
town
would
have
thought
strangely
of
him
if
he
had
not
a
gory
knife
had
been
found
close
to
the
murdered
man
and
it
had
been
recognized
by
somebody
as
belonging
to
muff
potter
so
the
story
ran
and
it
was
said
that
a
belated
citizen
had
come
upon
potter
washing
himself
in
the
branch
about
one
or
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
that
potter
had
at
once
sneaked
off
suspicious
circumstances
especially
the
washing
which
was
not
a
habit
with
potter
it
was
also
said
that
the
town
had
been
ransacked
for
this
murderer
the
public
are
not
slow
in
the
matter
of
sifting
evidence
and
arriving
at
a
verdict
but
that
he
could
not
be
found
horsemen
had
departed
down
all
the
roads
in
every
direction
and
the
sheriff
was
confident
that
he
would
be
captured
before
night
all
the
town
was
drifting
toward
the
graveyard
tom's
heartbreak
vanished
and
he
joined
the
procession
not
because
he
would
not
a
thousand
times
rather
go
anywhere
else
but
because
an
awful
unaccountable
fascination
drew
him
on
arrived
at
the
dreadful
place
he
wormed
his
small
body
through
the
crowd
and
saw
the
dismal
spectacle
it
seemed
to
him
an
age
since
he
was
there
before
somebody
pinched
his
arm
he
turned
and
his
eyes
met
huckleberry's
then
both
looked
elsewhere
at
once
and
wondered
if
anybody
had
noticed
anything
in
their
mutual
glance
but
everybody
was
talking
and
intent
upon
the
grisly
spectacle
before
them
poor
fellow
poor
young
fellow
this
ought
to
be
a
lesson
to
grave
robbers
muff
potter'll
hang
for
this
if
they
catch
him
this
was
the
drift
of
remark
and
the
minister
said
it
was
a
judgment
his
hand
is
here
now
tom
shivered
from
head
to
heel
for
his
eye
fell
upon
the
stolid
face
of
injun
joe
at
this
moment
the
crowd
began
to
sway
and
struggle
and
voices
shouted
it's
him
it's
him
he's
coming
himself
who
who
from
twenty
voices
muff
potter
hallo
he's
stopped
look
out
he's
turning
don't
let
him
get
away
people
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
over
tom's
head
said
he
wasn't
trying
to
get
away
he
only
looked
doubtful
and
perplexed
infernal
impudence
said
a
bystander
wanted
to
come
and
take
a
quiet
look
at
his
work
i
reckon
didn't
expect
any
company
the
crowd
fell
apart
now
and
the
sheriff
came
through
ostentatiously
leading
potter
by
the
arm
the
poor
fellow's
face
was
haggard
and
his
eyes
showed
the
fear
that
was
upon
him
when
he
stood
before
the
murdered
man
he
shook
as
with
a
palsy
and
he
put
his
face
in
his
hands
and
burst
into
tears
i
didn't
do
it
friends
he
sobbed
pon
my
word
and
honor
i
never
done
it
who's
accused
you
shouted
a
voice
this
shot
seemed
to
carry
home
potter
lifted
his
face
and
looked
around
him
with
a
pathetic
hopelessness
in
his
eyes
he
saw
injun
joe
and
exclaimed
oh
injun
joe
you
promised
me
you'd
never
is
that
your
knife
and
it
was
thrust
before
him
by
the
sheriff
potter
would
have
fallen
if
they
had
not
caught
him
and
eased
him
to
the
ground
then
he
said
something
told
me
t
if
i
didn't
come
back
and
get
he
shuddered
then
waved
his
nerveless
hand
with
a
vanquished
gesture
and
said
tell
em
joe
tell
em
it
ain't
any
use
any
more
then
huckleberry
and
tom
stood
dumb
and
staring
and
heard
the
stony
hearted
liar
reel
off
his
serene
statement
they
expecting
every
moment
that
the
clear
sky
would
deliver
god's
lightnings
upon
his
head
and
wondering
to
see
how
long
the
stroke
was
delayed
and
when
he
had
finished
and
still
stood
alive
and
whole
their
wavering
impulse
to
break
their
oath
and
save
the
poor
betrayed
prisoner's
life
faded
and
vanished
away
for
plainly
this
miscreant
had
sold
himself
to
satan
and
it
would
be
fatal
to
meddle
with
the
property
of
such
a
power
as
that
why
didn't
you
leave
what
did
you
want
to
come
here
for
somebody
said
i
couldn't
help
it
i
couldn't
help
it
potter
moaned
i
wanted
to
run
away
but
i
couldn't
seem
to
come
anywhere
but
here
and
he
fell
to
sobbing
again
injun
joe
repeated
his
statement
just
as
calmly
a
few
minutes
afterward
on
the
inquest
under
oath
and
the
boys
seeing
that
the
lightnings
were
still
withheld
were
confirmed
in
their
belief
that
joe
had
sold
himself
to
the
devil
he
was
now
become
to
them
the
most
balefully
interesting
object
they
had
ever
looked
upon
and
they
could
not
take
their
fascinated
eyes
from
his
face
they
inwardly
resolved
to
watch
him
nights
when
opportunity
should
offer
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
glimpse
of
his
dread
master
injun
joe
helped
to
raise
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
and
put
it
in
a
wagon
for
removal
and
it
was
whispered
through
the
shuddering
crowd
that
the
wound
bled
a
little
the
boys
thought
that
this
happy
circumstance
would
turn
suspicion
in
the
right
direction
but
they
were
disappointed
for
more
than
one
villager
remarked
it
was
within
three
feet
of
muff
potter
when
it
done
it
tom's
fearful
secret
and
gnawing
conscience
disturbed
his
sleep
for
as
much
as
a
week
after
this
and
at
breakfast
one
morning
sid
said
tom
you
pitch
around
and
talk
in
your
sleep
so
much
that
you
keep
me
awake
half
the
time
tom
blanched
and
dropped
his
eyes
it's
a
bad
sign
said
aunt
polly
gravely
what
you
got
on
your
mind
tom
nothing
nothing
t
i
know
of
but
the
boy's
hand
shook
so
that
he
spilled
his
coffee
and
you
do
talk
such
stuff
sid
said
last
night
you
said
it's
blood
it's
blood
that's
what
it
is
you
said
that
over
and
over
and
you
said
don't
torment
me
so
i'll
tell
tell
what
what
is
it
you'll
tell
everything
was
swimming
before
tom
there
is
no
telling
what
might
have
happened
now
but
luckily
the
concern
passed
out
of
aunt
polly's
face
and
she
came
to
tom's
relief
without
knowing
it
she
said
sho
it's
that
dreadful
murder
i
dream
about
it
most
every
night
myself
sometimes
i
dream
it's
me
that
done
it
mary
said
she
had
been
affected
much
the
same
way
sid
seemed
satisfied
tom
got
out
of
the
presence
as
quick
as
he
plausibly
could
and
after
that
he
complained
of
toothache
for
a
week
and
tied
up
his
jaws
every
night
he
never
knew
that
sid
lay
nightly
watching
and
frequently
slipped
the
bandage
free
and
then
leaned
on
his
elbow
listening
a
good
while
at
a
time
and
afterward
slipped
the
bandage
back
to
its
place
again
tom's
distress
of
mind
wore
off
gradually
and
the
toothache
grew
irksome
and
was
discarded
if
sid
really
managed
to
make
anything
out
of
tom's
disjointed
mutterings
he
kept
it
to
himself
it
seemed
to
tom
that
his
schoolmates
never
would
get
done
holding
inquests
on
dead
cats
and
thus
keeping
his
trouble
present
to
his
mind
sid
noticed
that
tom
never
was
coroner
at
one
of
these
inquiries
though
it
had
been
his
habit
to
take
the
lead
in
all
new
enterprises
he
noticed
too
that
tom
never
acted
as
a
witness
and
that
was
strange
and
sid
did
not
overlook
the
fact
that
tom
even
showed
a
marked
aversion
to
these
inquests
and
always
avoided
them
when
he
could
sid
marvelled
but
said
nothing
however
even
inquests
went
out
of
vogue
at
last
and
ceased
to
torture
tom's
conscience
every
day
or
two
during
this
time
of
sorrow
tom
watched
his
opportunity
and
went
to
the
little
grated
jail
window
and
smuggled
such
small
comforts
through
to
the
murderer
as
he
could
get
hold
of
the
jail
was
a
trifling
little
brick
den
that
stood
in
a
marsh
at
the
edge
of
the
village
and
no
guards
were
afforded
for
it
indeed
it
was
seldom
occupied
these
offerings
greatly
helped
to
ease
tom's
conscience
the
villagers
had
a
strong
desire
to
tar
and
feather
injun
joe
and
ride
him
on
a
rail
for
body
snatching
but
so
formidable
was
his
character
that
nobody
could
be
found
who
was
willing
to
take
the
lead
in
the
matter
so
it
was
dropped
he
had
been
careful
to
begin
both
of
his
inquest
statements
with
the
fight
without
confessing
the
grave
robbery
that
preceded
it
therefore
it
was
deemed
wisest
not
to
try
the
case
in
the
courts
at
present
chapter
xii
one
of
the
reasons
why
tom's
mind
had
drifted
away
from
its
secret
troubles
was
that
it
had
found
a
new
and
weighty
matter
to
interest
itself
about
becky
thatcher
had
stopped
coming
to
school
tom
had
struggled
with
his
pride
a
few
days
and
tried
to
whistle
her
down
the
wind
but
failed
he
began
to
find
himself
hanging
around
her
father's
house
nights
and
feeling
very
miserable
she
was
ill
what
if
she
should
die
there
was
distraction
in
the
thought
he
no
longer
took
an
interest
in
war
nor
even
in
piracy
the
charm
of
life
was
gone
there
was
nothing
but
dreariness
left
he
put
his
hoop
away
and
his
bat
there
was
no
joy
in
them
any
more
his
aunt
was
concerned
she
began
to
try
all
manner
of
remedies
on
him
she
was
one
of
those
people
who
are
infatuated
with
patent
medicines
and
all
new
fangled
methods
of
producing
health
or
mending
it
she
was
an
inveterate
experimenter
in
these
things
when
something
fresh
in
this
line
came
out
she
was
in
a
fever
right
away
to
try
it
not
on
herself
for
she
was
never
ailing
but
on
anybody
else
that
came
handy
she
was
a
subscriber
for
all
the
health
periodicals
and
phrenological
frauds
and
the
solemn
ignorance
they
were
inflated
with
was
breath
to
her
nostrils
all
the
rot
they
contained
about
ventilation
and
how
to
go
to
bed
and
how
to
get
up
and
what
to
eat
and
what
to
drink
and
how
much
exercise
to
take
and
what
frame
of
mind
to
keep
one's
self
in
and
what
sort
of
clothing
to
wear
was
all
gospel
to
her
and
she
never
observed
that
her
health
journals
of
the
current
month
customarily
upset
everything
they
had
recommended
the
month
before
she
was
as
simple
hearted
and
honest
as
the
day
was
long
and
so
she
was
an
easy
victim
she
gathered
together
her
quack
periodicals
and
her
quack
medicines
and
thus
armed
with
death
went
about
on
her
pale
horse
metaphorically
speaking
with
hell
following
after
but
she
never
suspected
that
she
was
not
an
angel
of
healing
and
the
balm
of
gilead
in
disguise
to
the
suffering
neighbors
the
water
treatment
was
new
now
and
tom's
low
condition
was
a
windfall
to
her
she
had
him
out
at
daylight
every
morning
stood
him
up
in
the
wood
shed
and
drowned
him
with
a
deluge
of
cold
water
then
she
scrubbed
him
down
with
a
towel
like
a
file
and
so
brought
him
to
then
she
rolled
him
up
in
a
wet
sheet
and
put
him
away
under
blankets
till
she
sweated
his
soul
clean
and
the
yellow
stains
of
it
came
through
his
pores
as
tom
said
yet
notwithstanding
all
this
the
boy
grew
more
and
more
melancholy
and
pale
and
dejected
she
added
hot
baths
sitz
baths
shower
baths
and
plunges
the
boy
remained
as
dismal
as
a
hearse
she
began
to
assist
the
water
with
a
slim
oatmeal
diet
and
blister
plasters
she
calculated
his
capacity
as
she
would
a
jug's
and
filled
him
up
every
day
with
quack
cure
alls
tom
had
become
indifferent
to
persecution
by
this
time
this
phase
filled
the
old
lady's
heart
with
consternation
this
indifference
must
be
broken
up
at
any
cost
now
she
heard
of
pain
killer
for
the
first
time
she
ordered
a
lot
at
once
she
tasted
it
and
was
filled
with
gratitude
it
was
simply
fire
in
a
liquid
form
she
dropped
the
water
treatment
and
everything
else
and
pinned
her
faith
to
pain
killer
she
gave
tom
a
teaspoonful
and
watched
with
the
deepest
anxiety
for
the
result
her
troubles
were
instantly
at
rest
her
soul
at
peace
again
for
the
indifference
was
broken
up
the
boy
could
not
have
shown
a
wilder
heartier
interest
if
she
had
built
a
fire
under
him
tom
felt
that
it
was
time
to
wake
up
this
sort
of
life
might
be
romantic
enough
in
his
blighted
condition
but
it
was
getting
to
have
too
little
sentiment
and
too
much
distracting
variety
about
it
so
he
thought
over
various
plans
for
relief
and
finally
hit
upon
that
of
professing
to
be
fond
of
pain
killer
he
asked
for
it
so
often
that
he
became
a
nuisance
and
his
aunt
ended
by
telling
him
to
help
himself
and
quit
bothering
her
if
it
had
been
sid
she
would
have
had
no
misgivings
to
alloy
her
delight
but
since
it
was
tom
she
watched
the
bottle
clandestinely
she
found
that
the
medicine
did
really
diminish
but
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
the
boy
was
mending
the
health
of
a
crack
in
the
sitting
room
floor
with
it
one
day
tom
was
in
the
act
of
dosing
the
crack
when
his
aunt's
yellow
cat
came
along
purring
eyeing
the
teaspoon
avariciously
and
begging
for
a
taste
tom
said
don't
ask
for
it
unless
you
want
it
peter
but
peter
signified
that
he
did
want
it
you
better
make
sure
peter
was
sure
now
you've
asked
for
it
and
i'll
give
it
to
you
because
there
ain't
anything
mean
about
me
but
if
you
find
you
don't
like
it
you
mustn't
blame
anybody
but
your
own
self
peter
was
agreeable
so
tom
pried
his
mouth
open
and
poured
down
the
pain
killer
peter
sprang
a
couple
of
yards
in
the
air
and
then
delivered
a
war
whoop
and
set
off
round
and
round
the
room
banging
against
furniture
upsetting
flower
pots
and
making
general
havoc
next
he
rose
on
his
hind
feet
and
pranced
around
in
a
frenzy
of
enjoyment
with
his
head
over
his
shoulder
and
his
voice
proclaiming
his
unappeasable
happiness
then
he
went
tearing
around
the
house
again
spreading
chaos
and
destruction
in
his
path
aunt
polly
entered
in
time
to
see
him
throw
a
few
double
summersets
deliver
a
final
mighty
hurrah
and
sail
through
the
open
window
carrying
the
rest
of
the
flower
pots
with
him
the
old
lady
stood
petrified
with
astonishment
peering
over
her
glasses
tom
lay
on
the
floor
expiring
with
laughter
tom
what
on
earth
ails
that
cat
i
don't
know
aunt
gasped
the
boy
why
i
never
see
anything
like
it
what
did
make
him
act
so
deed
i
don't
know
aunt
polly
cats
always
act
so
when
they're
having
a
good
time
they
do
do
they
there
was
something
in
the
tone
that
made
tom
apprehensive
yes'm
that
is
i
believe
they
do
you
do
yes'm
the
old
lady
was
bending
down
tom
watching
with
interest
emphasized
by
anxiety
too
late
he
divined
her
drift
the
handle
of
the
telltale
tea
spoon
was
visible
under
the
bed
valance
aunt
polly
took
it
held
it
up
tom
winced
and
dropped
his
eyes
aunt
polly
raised
him
by
the
usual
handle
his
ear
and
cracked
his
head
soundly
with
her
thimble
now
sir
what
did
you
want
to
treat
that
poor
dumb
beast
so
for
i
done
it
out
of
pity
for
him
because
he
hadn't
any
aunt
hadn't
any
aunt
you
numskull
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
heaps
because
if
he'd
had
one
she'd
a
burnt
him
out
herself
she'd
a
roasted
his
bowels
out
of
him
thout
any
more
feeling
than
if
he
was
a
human
aunt
polly
felt
a
sudden
pang
of
remorse
this
was
putting
the
thing
in
a
new
light
what
was
cruelty
to
a
cat
might
be
cruelty
to
a
boy
too
she
began
to
soften
she
felt
sorry
her
eyes
watered
a
little
and
she
put
her
hand
on
tom's
head
and
said
gently
i
was
meaning
for
the
best
tom
and
tom
it
did
do
you
good
tom
looked
up
in
her
face
with
just
a
perceptible
twinkle
peeping
through
his
gravity
i
know
you
was
meaning
for
the
best
aunty
and
so
was
i
with
peter
it
done
him
good
too
i
never
see
him
get
around
so
since
oh
go
long
with
you
tom
before
you
aggravate
me
again
and
you
try
and
see
if
you
can't
be
a
good
boy
for
once
and
you
needn't
take
any
more
medicine
tom
reached
school
ahead
of
time
it
was
noticed
that
this
strange
thing
had
been
occurring
every
day
latterly
and
now
as
usual
of
late
he
hung
about
the
gate
of
the
schoolyard
instead
of
playing
with
his
comrades
he
was
sick
he
said
and
he
looked
it
he
tried
to
seem
to
be
looking
everywhere
but
whither
he
really
was
looking
down
the
road
presently
jeff
thatcher
hove
in
sight
and
tom's
face
lighted
he
gazed
a
moment
and
then
turned
sorrowfully
away
when
jeff
arrived
tom
accosted
him
and
led
up
warily
to
opportunities
for
remark
about
becky
but
the
giddy
lad
never
could
see
the
bait
tom
watched
and
watched
hoping
whenever
a
frisking
frock
came
in
sight
and
hating
the
owner
of
it
as
soon
as
he
saw
she
was
not
the
right
one
at
last
frocks
ceased
to
appear
and
he
dropped
hopelessly
into
the
dumps
he
entered
the
empty
schoolhouse
and
sat
down
to
suffer
then
one
more
frock
passed
in
at
the
gate
and
tom's
heart
gave
a
great
bound
the
next
instant
he
was
out
and
going
on
like
an
indian
yelling
laughing
chasing
boys
jumping
over
the
fence
at
risk
of
life
and
limb
throwing
handsprings
standing
on
his
head
doing
all
the
heroic
things
he
could
conceive
of
and
keeping
a
furtive
eye
out
all
the
while
to
see
if
becky
thatcher
was
noticing
but
she
seemed
to
be
unconscious
of
it
all
she
never
looked
could
it
be
possible
that
she
was
not
aware
that
he
was
there
he
carried
his
exploits
to
her
immediate
vicinity
came
war
whooping
around
snatched
a
boy's
cap
hurled
it
to
the
roof
of
the
schoolhouse
broke
through
a
group
of
boys
tumbling
them
in
every
direction
and
fell
sprawling
himself
under
becky's
nose
almost
upsetting
her
and
she
turned
with
her
nose
in
the
air
and
he
heard
her
say
mf
some
people
think
they're
mighty
smart
always
showing
off
tom's
cheeks
burned
he
gathered
himself
up
and
sneaked
off
crushed
and
crestfallen
chapter
xiii
tom's
mind
was
made
up
now
he
was
gloomy
and
desperate
he
was
a
forsaken
friendless
boy
he
said
nobody
loved
him
when
they
found
out
what
they
had
driven
him
to
perhaps
they
would
be
sorry
he
had
tried
to
do
right
and
get
along
but
they
would
not
let
him
since
nothing
would
do
them
but
to
be
rid
of
him
let
it
be
so
and
let
them
blame
him
for
the
consequences
why
shouldn't
they
what
right
had
the
friendless
to
complain
yes
they
had
forced
him
to
it
at
last
he
would
lead
a
life
of
crime
there
was
no
choice
by
this
time
he
was
far
down
meadow
lane
and
the
bell
for
school
to
take
up
tinkled
faintly
upon
his
ear
he
sobbed
now
to
think
he
should
never
never
hear
that
old
familiar
sound
any
more
it
was
very
hard
but
it
was
forced
on
him
since
he
was
driven
out
into
the
cold
world
he
must
submit
but
he
forgave
them
then
the
sobs
came
thick
and
fast
just
at
this
point
he
met
his
soul's
sworn
comrade
joe
harper
hard
eyed
and
with
evidently
a
great
and
dismal
purpose
in
his
heart
plainly
here
were
two
souls
with
but
a
single
thought
tom
wiping
his
eyes
with
his
sleeve
began
to
blubber
out
something
about
a
resolution
to
escape
from
hard
usage
and
lack
of
sympathy
at
home
by
roaming
abroad
into
the
great
world
never
to
return
and
ended
by
hoping
that
joe
would
not
forget
him
but
it
transpired
that
this
was
a
request
which
joe
had
just
been
going
to
make
of
tom
and
had
come
to
hunt
him
up
for
that
purpose
his
mother
had
whipped
him
for
drinking
some
cream
which
he
had
never
tasted
and
knew
nothing
about
it
was
plain
that
she
was
tired
of
him
and
wished
him
to
go
if
she
felt
that
way
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
succumb
he
hoped
she
would
be
happy
and
never
regret
having
driven
her
poor
boy
out
into
the
unfeeling
world
to
suffer
and
die
as
the
two
boys
walked
sorrowing
along
they
made
a
new
compact
to
stand
by
each
other
and
be
brothers
and
never
separate
till
death
relieved
them
of
their
troubles
then
they
began
to
lay
their
plans
joe
was
for
being
a
hermit
and
living
on
crusts
in
a
remote
cave
and
dying
some
time
of
cold
and
want
and
grief
but
after
listening
to
tom
he
conceded
that
there
were
some
conspicuous
advantages
about
a
life
of
crime
and
so
he
consented
to
be
a
pirate
three
miles
below
st
petersburg
at
a
point
where
the
mississippi
river
was
a
trifle
over
a
mile
wide
there
was
a
long
narrow
wooded
island
with
a
shallow
bar
at
the
head
of
it
and
this
offered
well
as
a
rendezvous
it
was
not
inhabited
it
lay
far
over
toward
the
further
shore
abreast
a
dense
and
almost
wholly
unpeopled
forest
so
jackson's
island
was
chosen
who
were
to
be
the
subjects
of
their
piracies
was
a
matter
that
did
not
occur
to
them
then
they
hunted
up
huckleberry
finn
and
he
joined
them
promptly
for
all
careers
were
one
to
him
he
was
indifferent
they
presently
separated
to
meet
at
a
lonely
spot
on
the
river
bank
two
miles
above
the
village
at
the
favorite
hour
which
was
midnight
there
was
a
small
log
raft
there
which
they
meant
to
capture
each
would
bring
hooks
and
lines
and
such
provision
as
he
could
steal
in
the
most
dark
and
mysterious
way
as
became
outlaws
and
before
the
afternoon
was
done
they
had
all
managed
to
enjoy
the
sweet
glory
of
spreading
the
fact
that
pretty
soon
the
town
would
hear
something
all
who
got
this
vague
hint
were
cautioned
to
be
mum
and
wait
about
midnight
tom
arrived
with
a
boiled
ham
and
a
few
trifles
and
stopped
in
a
dense
undergrowth
on
a
small
bluff
overlooking
the
meeting
place
it
was
starlight
and
very
still
the
mighty
river
lay
like
an
ocean
at
rest
tom
listened
a
moment
but
no
sound
disturbed
the
quiet
then
he
gave
a
low
distinct
whistle
it
was
answered
from
under
the
bluff
tom
whistled
twice
more
these
signals
were
answered
in
the
same
way
then
a
guarded
voice
said
who
goes
there
tom
sawyer
the
black
avenger
of
the
spanish
main
name
your
names
huck
finn
the
red
handed
and
joe
harper
the
terror
of
the
seas
tom
had
furnished
these
titles
from
his
favorite
literature
tis
well
give
the
countersign
two
hoarse
whispers
delivered
the
same
awful
word
simultaneously
to
the
brooding
night
blood
then
tom
tumbled
his
ham
over
the
bluff
and
let
himself
down
after
it
tearing
both
skin
and
clothes
to
some
extent
in
the
effort
there
was
an
easy
comfortable
path
along
the
shore
under
the
bluff
but
it
lacked
the
advantages
of
difficulty
and
danger
so
valued
by
a
pirate
the
terror
of
the
seas
had
brought
a
side
of
bacon
and
had
about
worn
himself
out
with
getting
it
there
finn
the
red
handed
had
stolen
a
skillet
and
a
quantity
of
half
cured
leaf
tobacco
and
had
also
brought
a
few
corn
cobs
to
make
pipes
with
but
none
of
the
pirates
smoked
or
chewed
but
himself
the
black
avenger
of
the
spanish
main
said
it
would
never
do
to
start
without
some
fire
that
was
a
wise
thought
matches
were
hardly
known
there
in
that
day
they
saw
a
fire
smouldering
upon
a
great
raft
a
hundred
yards
above
and
they
went
stealthily
thither
and
helped
themselves
to
a
chunk
they
made
an
imposing
adventure
of
it
saying
hist
every
now
and
then
and
suddenly
halting
with
finger
on
lip
moving
with
hands
on
imaginary
dagger
hilts
and
giving
orders
in
dismal
whispers
that
if
the
foe
stirred
to
let
him
have
it
to
the
hilt
because
dead
men
tell
no
tales
they
knew
well
enough
that
the
raftsmen
were
all
down
at
the
village
laying
in
stores
or
having
a
spree
but
still
that
was
no
excuse
for
their
conducting
this
thing
in
an
unpiratical
way
they
shoved
off
presently
tom
in
command
huck
at
the
after
oar
and
joe
at
the
forward
tom
stood
amidships
gloomy
browed
and
with
folded
arms
and
gave
his
orders
in
a
low
stern
whisper
luff
and
bring
her
to
the
wind
aye
aye

steady

steady

let
her
go
off
a
point
point
it
is
sir
as
the
boys
steadily
and
monotonously
drove
the
raft
toward
mid
stream
it
was
no
doubt
understood
that
these
orders
were
given
only
for
style
and
were
not
intended
to
mean
anything
in
particular
what

men

y

steady
it

the
raft
drew
beyond
the
middle
of
the
river
the
boys
pointed
her
head
right
and
then
lay
on
their
oars
the
river
was
not
high
so
there
was
not
more
than
a
two
or
three
mile
current
hardly
a
word
was
said
during
the
next
three
quarters
of
an
hour
now
the
raft
was
passing
before
the
distant
town
two
or
three
glimmering
lights
showed
where
it
lay
peacefully
sleeping
beyond
the
vague
vast
sweep
of
star
gemmed
water
unconscious
of
the
tremendous
event
that
was
happening
the
black
avenger
stood
still
with
folded
arms
looking
his
last
upon
the
scene
of
his
former
joys
and
his
later
sufferings
and
wishing
she
could
see
him
now
abroad
on
the
wild
sea
facing
peril
and
death
with
dauntless
heart
going
to
his
doom
with
a
grim
smile
on
his
lips
it
was
but
a
small
strain
on
his
imagination
to
remove
jackson's
island
beyond
eye
shot
of
the
village
and
so
he
looked
his
last
with
a
broken
and
satisfied
heart
the
other
pirates
were
looking
their
last
too
and
they
all
looked
so
long
that
they
came
near
letting
the
current
drift
them
out
of
the
range
of
the
island
but
they
discovered
the
danger
in
time
and
made
shift
to
avert
it
about
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
the
raft
grounded
on
the
bar
two
hundred
yards
above
the
head
of
the
island
and
they
waded
back
and
forth
until
they
had
landed
their
freight
part
of
the
little
raft's
belongings
consisted
of
an
old
sail
and
this
they
spread
over
a
nook
in
the
bushes
for
a
tent
to
shelter
their
provisions
but
they
themselves
would
sleep
in
the
open
air
in
good
weather
as
became
outlaws
they
built
a
fire
against
the
side
of
a
great
log
twenty
or
thirty
steps
within
the
sombre
depths
of
the
forest
and
then
cooked
some
bacon
in
the
frying
pan
for
supper
and
used
up
half
of
the
corn
pone
stock
they
had
brought
it
seemed
glorious
sport
to
be
feasting
in
that
wild
free
way
in
the
virgin
forest
of
an
unexplored
and
uninhabited
island
far
from
the
haunts
of
men
and
they
said
they
never
would
return
to
civilization
the
climbing
fire
lit
up
their
faces
and
threw
its
ruddy
glare
upon
the
pillared
tree
trunks
of
their
forest
temple
and
upon
the
varnished
foliage
and
festooning
vines
when
the
last
crisp
slice
of
bacon
was
gone
and
the
last
allowance
of
corn
pone
devoured
the
boys
stretched
themselves
out
on
the
grass
filled
with
contentment
they
could
have
found
a
cooler
place
but
they
would
not
deny
themselves
such
a
romantic
feature
as
the
roasting
campfire
ain't
it
gay
said
joe
it's
nuts
said
tom
what
would
the
boys
say
if
they
could
see
us
say
well
they'd
just
die
to
be
here
hey
hucky
i
reckon
so
said
huckleberry
anyways
i'm
suited
i
don't
want
nothing
better'n
this
i
don't
ever
get
enough
to
eat
gen'ally
and
here
they
can't
come
and
pick
at
a
feller
and
bullyrag
him
so
it's
just
the
life
for
me
said
tom
you
don't
have
to
get
up
mornings
and
you
don't
have
to
go
to
school
and
wash
and
all
that
blame
foolishness
you
see
a
pirate
don't
have
to
do
anything
joe
when
he's
ashore
but
a
hermit
he
has
to
be
praying
considerable
and
then
he
don't
have
any
fun
anyway
all
by
himself
that
way
oh
yes
that's
so
said
joe
but
i
hadn't
thought
much
about
it
you
know
i'd
a
good
deal
rather
be
a
pirate
now
that
i've
tried
it
you
see
said
tom
people
don't
go
much
on
hermits
nowadays
like
they
used
to
in
old
times
but
a
pirate's
always
respected
and
a
hermit's
got
to
sleep
on
the
hardest
place
he
can
find
and
put
sackcloth
and
ashes
on
his
head
and
stand
out
in
the
rain
and
what
does
he
put
sackcloth
and
ashes
on
his
head
for
inquired
huck
i
dono
but
they've
got
to
do
it
hermits
always
do
you'd
have
to
do
that
if
you
was
a
hermit
dern'd
if
i
would
said
huck
well
what
would
you
do
i
dono
but
i
wouldn't
do
that
why
huck
you'd
have
to
how'd
you
get
around
it
why
i
just
wouldn't
stand
it
i'd
run
away
run
away
well
you
would
be
a
nice
old
slouch
of
a
hermit
you'd
be
a
disgrace
the
red
handed
made
no
response
being
better
employed
he
had
finished
gouging
out
a
cob
and
now
he
fitted
a
weed
stem
to
it
loaded
it
with
tobacco
and
was
pressing
a
coal
to
the
charge
and
blowing
a
cloud
of
fragrant
smoke
he
was
in
the
full
bloom
of
luxurious
contentment
the
other
pirates
envied
him
this
majestic
vice
and
secretly
resolved
to
acquire
it
shortly
presently
huck
said
what
does
pirates
have
to
do
tom
said
oh
they
have
just
a
bully
time
take
ships
and
burn
them
and
get
the
money
and
bury
it
in
awful
places
in
their
island
where
there's
ghosts
and
things
to
watch
it
and
kill
everybody
in
the
ships
make
em
walk
a
plank
and
they
carry
the
women
to
the
island
said
joe
they
don't
kill
the
women
no
assented
tom
they
don't
kill
the
women
they're
too
noble
and
the
women's
always
beautiful
too
and
don't
they
wear
the
bulliest
clothes
oh
no
all
gold
and
silver
and
di'monds
said
joe
with
enthusiasm
who
said
huck
why
the
pirates
huck
scanned
his
own
clothing
forlornly
i
reckon
i
ain't
dressed
fitten
for
a
pirate
said
he
with
a
regretful
pathos
in
his
voice
but
i
ain't
got
none
but
these
but
the
other
boys
told
him
the
fine
clothes
would
come
fast
enough
after
they
should
have
begun
their
adventures
they
made
him
understand
that
his
poor
rags
would
do
to
begin
with
though
it
was
customary
for
wealthy
pirates
to
start
with
a
proper
wardrobe
gradually
their
talk
died
out
and
drowsiness
began
to
steal
upon
the
eyelids
of
the
little
waifs
the
pipe
dropped
from
the
fingers
of
the
red
handed
and
he
slept
the
sleep
of
the
conscience
free
and
the
weary
the
terror
of
the
seas
and
the
black
avenger
of
the
spanish
main
had
more
difficulty
in
getting
to
sleep
they
said
their
prayers
inwardly
and
lying
down
since
there
was
nobody
there
with
authority
to
make
them
kneel
and
recite
aloud
in
truth
they
had
a
mind
not
to
say
them
at
all
but
they
were
afraid
to
proceed
to
such
lengths
as
that
lest
they
might
call
down
a
sudden
and
special
thunderbolt
from
heaven
then
at
once
they
reached
and
hovered
upon
the
imminent
verge
of
sleep
but
an
intruder
came
now
that
would
not
down
it
was
conscience
they
began
to
feel
a
vague
fear
that
they
had
been
doing
wrong
to
run
away
and
next
they
thought
of
the
stolen
meat
and
then
the
real
torture
came
they
tried
to
argue
it
away
by
reminding
conscience
that
they
had
purloined
sweetmeats
and
apples
scores
of
times
but
conscience
was
not
to
be
appeased
by
such
thin
plausibilities
it
seemed
to
them
in
the
end
that
there
was
no
getting
around
the
stubborn
fact
that
taking
sweetmeats
was
only
hooking
while
taking
bacon
and
hams
and
such
valuables
was
plain
simple
stealing
and
there
was
a
command
against
that
in
the
bible
so
they
inwardly
resolved
that
so
long
as
they
remained
in
the
business
their
piracies
should
not
again
be
sullied
with
the
crime
of
stealing
then
conscience
granted
a
truce
and
these
curiously
inconsistent
pirates
fell
peacefully
to
sleep
chapter
xiv
when
tom
awoke
in
the
morning
he
wondered
where
he
was
he
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
around
then
he
comprehended
it
was
the
cool
gray
dawn
and
there
was
a
delicious
sense
of
repose
and
peace
in
the
deep
pervading
calm
and
silence
of
the
woods
not
a
leaf
stirred
not
a
sound
obtruded
upon
great
nature's
meditation
beaded
dewdrops
stood
upon
the
leaves
and
grasses
a
white
layer
of
ashes
covered
the
fire
and
a
thin
blue
breath
of
smoke
rose
straight
into
the
air
joe
and
huck
still
slept
now
far
away
in
the
woods
a
bird
called
another
answered
presently
the
hammering
of
a
woodpecker
was
heard
gradually
the
cool
dim
gray
of
the
morning
whitened
and
as
gradually
sounds
multiplied
and
life
manifested
itself
the
marvel
of
nature
shaking
off
sleep
and
going
to
work
unfolded
itself
to
the
musing
boy
a
little
green
worm
came
crawling
over
a
dewy
leaf
lifting
two
thirds
of
his
body
into
the
air
from
time
to
time
and
sniffing
around
then
proceeding
again
for
he
was
measuring
tom
said
and
when
the
worm
approached
him
of
its
own
accord
he
sat
as
still
as
a
stone
with
his
hopes
rising
and
falling
by
turns
as
the
creature
still
came
toward
him
or
seemed
inclined
to
go
elsewhere
and
when
at
last
it
considered
a
painful
moment
with
its
curved
body
in
the
air
and
then
came
decisively
down
upon
tom's
leg
and
began
a
journey
over
him
his
whole
heart
was
glad
for
that
meant
that
he
was
going
to
have
a
new
suit
of
clothes
without
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
a
gaudy
piratical
uniform
now
a
procession
of
ants
appeared
from
nowhere
in
particular
and
went
about
their
labors
one
struggled
manfully
by
with
a
dead
spider
five
times
as
big
as
itself
in
its
arms
and
lugged
it
straight
up
a
tree
trunk
a
brown
spotted
lady
bug
climbed
the
dizzy
height
of
a
grass
blade
and
tom
bent
down
close
to
it
and
said
lady
bug
lady
bug
fly
away
home
your
house
is
on
fire
your
children's
alone
and
she
took
wing
and
went
off
to
see
about
it
which
did
not
surprise
the
boy
for
he
knew
of
old
that
this
insect
was
credulous
about
conflagrations
and
he
had
practised
upon
its
simplicity
more
than
once
a
tumblebug
came
next
heaving
sturdily
at
its
ball
and
tom
touched
the
creature
to
see
it
shut
its
legs
against
its
body
and
pretend
to
be
dead
the
birds
were
fairly
rioting
by
this
time
a
catbird
the
northern
mocker
lit
in
a
tree
over
tom's
head
and
trilled
out
her
imitations
of
her
neighbors
in
a
rapture
of
enjoyment
then
a
shrill
jay
swept
down
a
flash
of
blue
flame
and
stopped
on
a
twig
almost
within
the
boy's
reach
cocked
his
head
to
one
side
and
eyed
the
strangers
with
a
consuming
curiosity
a
gray
squirrel
and
a
big
fellow
of
the
fox
kind
came
skurrying
along
sitting
up
at
intervals
to
inspect
and
chatter
at
the
boys
for
the
wild
things
had
probably
never
seen
a
human
being
before
and
scarcely
knew
whether
to
be
afraid
or
not
all
nature
was
wide
awake
and
stirring
now
long
lances
of
sunlight
pierced
down
through
the
dense
foliage
far
and
near
and
a
few
butterflies
came
fluttering
upon
the
scene
tom
stirred
up
the
other
pirates
and
they
all
clattered
away
with
a
shout
and
in
a
minute
or
two
were
stripped
and
chasing
after
and
tumbling
over
each
other
in
the
shallow
limpid
water
of
the
white
sandbar
they
felt
no
longing
for
the
little
village
sleeping
in
the
distance
beyond
the
majestic
waste
of
water
a
vagrant
current
or
a
slight
rise
in
the
river
had
carried
off
their
raft
but
this
only
gratified
them
since
its
going
was
something
like
burning
the
bridge
between
them
and
civilization
they
came
back
to
camp
wonderfully
refreshed
glad
hearted
and
ravenous
and
they
soon
had
the
camp
fire
blazing
up
again
huck
found
a
spring
of
clear
cold
water
close
by
and
the
boys
made
cups
of
broad
oak
or
hickory
leaves
and
felt
that
water
sweetened
with
such
a
wildwood
charm
as
that
would
be
a
good
enough
substitute
for
coffee
while
joe
was
slicing
bacon
for
breakfast
tom
and
huck
asked
him
to
hold
on
a
minute
they
stepped
to
a
promising
nook
in
the
river
bank
and
threw
in
their
lines
almost
immediately
they
had
reward
joe
had
not
had
time
to
get
impatient
before
they
were
back
again
with
some
handsome
bass
a
couple
of
sun
perch
and
a
small
catfish
provisions
enough
for
quite
a
family
they
fried
the
fish
with
the
bacon
and
were
astonished
for
no
fish
had
ever
seemed
so
delicious
before
they
did
not
know
that
the
quicker
a
fresh
water
fish
is
on
the
fire
after
he
is
caught
the
better
he
is
and
they
reflected
little
upon
what
a
sauce
open
air
sleeping
open
air
exercise
bathing
and
a
large
ingredient
of
hunger
make
too
they
lay
around
in
the
shade
after
breakfast
while
huck
had
a
smoke
and
then
went
off
through
the
woods
on
an
exploring
expedition
they
tramped
gayly
along
over
decaying
logs
through
tangled
underbrush
among
solemn
monarchs
of
the
forest
hung
from
their
crowns
to
the
ground
with
a
drooping
regalia
of
grape
vines
now
and
then
they
came
upon
snug
nooks
carpeted
with
grass
and
jeweled
with
flowers
they
found
plenty
of
things
to
be
delighted
with
but
nothing
to
be
astonished
at
they
discovered
that
the
island
was
about
three
miles
long
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
and
that
the
shore
it
lay
closest
to
was
only
separated
from
it
by
a
narrow
channel
hardly
two
hundred
yards
wide
they
took
a
swim
about
every
hour
so
it
was
close
upon
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
when
they
got
back
to
camp
they
were
too
hungry
to
stop
to
fish
but
they
fared
sumptuously
upon
cold
ham
and
then
threw
themselves
down
in
the
shade
to
talk
but
the
talk
soon
began
to
drag
and
then
died
the
stillness
the
solemnity
that
brooded
in
the
woods
and
the
sense
of
loneliness
began
to
tell
upon
the
spirits
of
the
boys
they
fell
to
thinking
a
sort
of
undefined
longing
crept
upon
them
this
took
dim
shape
presently
it
was
budding
homesickness
even
finn
the
red
handed
was
dreaming
of
his
doorsteps
and
empty
hogsheads
but
they
were
all
ashamed
of
their
weakness
and
none
was
brave
enough
to
speak
his
thought
for
some
time
now
the
boys
had
been
dully
conscious
of
a
peculiar
sound
in
the
distance
just
as
one
sometimes
is
of
the
ticking
of
a
clock
which
he
takes
no
distinct
note
of
but
now
this
mysterious
sound
became
more
pronounced
and
forced
a
recognition
the
boys
started
glanced
at
each
other
and
then
each
assumed
a
listening
attitude
there
was
a
long
silence
profound
and
unbroken
then
a
deep
sullen
boom
came
floating
down
out
of
the
distance
what
is
it
exclaimed
joe
under
his
breath
i
wonder
said
tom
in
a
whisper
tain't
thunder
said
huckleberry
in
an
awed
tone
becuz
thunder
hark
said
tom
listen
don't
talk
they
waited
a
time
that
seemed
an
age
and
then
the
same
muffled
boom
troubled
the
solemn
hush
let's
go
and
see
they
sprang
to
their
feet
and
hurried
to
the
shore
toward
the
town
they
parted
the
bushes
on
the
bank
and
peered
out
over
the
water
the
little
steam
ferry
boat
was
about
a
mile
below
the
village
drifting
with
the
current
her
broad
deck
seemed
crowded
with
people
there
were
a
great
many
skiffs
rowing
about
or
floating
with
the
stream
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
ferryboat
but
the
boys
could
not
determine
what
the
men
in
them
were
doing
presently
a
great
jet
of
white
smoke
burst
from
the
ferryboat's
side
and
as
it
expanded
and
rose
in
a
lazy
cloud
that
same
dull
throb
of
sound
was
borne
to
the
listeners
again
i
know
now
exclaimed
tom
somebody's
drownded
that's
it
said
huck
they
done
that
last
summer
when
bill
turner
got
drownded
they
shoot
a
cannon
over
the
water
and
that
makes
him
come
up
to
the
top
yes
and
they
take
loaves
of
bread
and
put
quicksilver
in
em
and
set
em
afloat
and
wherever
there's
anybody
that's
drownded
they'll
float
right
there
and
stop
yes
i've
heard
about
that
said
joe
i
wonder
what
makes
the
bread
do
that
oh
it
ain't
the
bread
so
much
said
tom
i
reckon
it's
mostly
what
they
say
over
it
before
they
start
it
out
but
they
don't
say
anything
over
it
said
huck
i've
seen
em
and
they
don't
well
that's
funny
said
tom
but
maybe
they
say
it
to
themselves
of
course
they
do
anybody
might
know
that
the
other
boys
agreed
that
there
was
reason
in
what
tom
said
because
an
ignorant
lump
of
bread
uninstructed
by
an
incantation
could
not
be
expected
to
act
very
intelligently
when
set
upon
an
errand
of
such
gravity
by
jings
i
wish
i
was
over
there
now
said
joe
i
do
too
said
huck
i'd
give
heaps
to
know
who
it
is
the
boys
still
listened
and
watched
presently
a
revealing
thought
flashed
through
tom's
mind
and
he
exclaimed
boys
i
know
who's
drownded
it's
us
they
felt
like
heroes
in
an
instant
here
was
a
gorgeous
triumph
they
were
missed
they
were
mourned
hearts
were
breaking
on
their
account
tears
were
being
shed
accusing
memories
of
unkindness
to
these
poor
lost
lads
were
rising
up
and
unavailing
regrets
and
remorse
were
being
indulged
and
best
of
all
the
departed
were
the
talk
of
the
whole
town
and
the
envy
of
all
the
boys
as
far
as
this
dazzling
notoriety
was
concerned
this
was
fine
it
was
worth
while
to
be
a
pirate
after
all
as
twilight
drew
on
the
ferryboat
went
back
to
her
accustomed
business
and
the
skiffs
disappeared
the
pirates
returned
to
camp
they
were
jubilant
with
vanity
over
their
new
grandeur
and
the
illustrious
trouble
they
were
making
they
caught
fish
cooked
supper
and
ate
it
and
then
fell
to
guessing
at
what
the
village
was
thinking
and
saying
about
them
and
the
pictures
they
drew
of
the
public
distress
on
their
account
were
gratifying
to
look
upon
from
their
point
of
view
but
when
the
shadows
of
night
closed
them
in
they
gradually
ceased
to
talk
and
sat
gazing
into
the
fire
with
their
minds
evidently
wandering
elsewhere
the
excitement
was
gone
now
and
tom
and
joe
could
not
keep
back
thoughts
of
certain
persons
at
home
who
were
not
enjoying
this
fine
frolic
as
much
as
they
were
misgivings
came
they
grew
troubled
and
unhappy
a
sigh
or
two
escaped
unawares
by
and
by
joe
timidly
ventured
upon
a
roundabout
feeler
as
to
how
the
others
might
look
upon
a
return
to
civilization
not
right
now
but
tom
withered
him
with
derision
huck
being
uncommitted
as
yet
joined
in
with
tom
and
the
waverer
quickly
explained
and
was
glad
to
get
out
of
the
scrape
with
as
little
taint
of
chicken
hearted
home
sickness
clinging
to
his
garments
as
he
could
mutiny
was
effectually
laid
to
rest
for
the
moment
as
the
night
deepened
huck
began
to
nod
and
presently
to
snore
joe
followed
next
tom
lay
upon
his
elbow
motionless
for
some
time
watching
the
two
intently
at
last
he
got
up
cautiously
on
his
knees
and
went
searching
among
the
grass
and
the
flickering
reflections
flung
by
the
campfire
he
picked
up
and
inspected
several
large
semi
cylinders
of
the
thin
white
bark
of
a
sycamore
and
finally
chose
two
which
seemed
to
suit
him
then
he
knelt
by
the
fire
and
painfully
wrote
something
upon
each
of
these
with
his
red
keel
one
he
rolled
up
and
put
in
his
jacket
pocket
and
the
other
he
put
in
joe's
hat
and
removed
it
to
a
little
distance
from
the
owner
and
he
also
put
into
the
hat
certain
schoolboy
treasures
of
almost
inestimable
value
among
them
a
lump
of
chalk
an
india
rubber
ball
three
fishhooks
and
one
of
that
kind
of
marbles
known
as
a
sure
nough
crystal
then
he
tiptoed
his
way
cautiously
among
the
trees
till
he
felt
that
he
was
out
of
hearing
and
straightway
broke
into
a
keen
run
in
the
direction
of
the
sandbar
chapter
xv
a
few
minutes
later
tom
was
in
the
shoal
water
of
the
bar
wading
toward
the
illinois
shore
before
the
depth
reached
his
middle
he
was
halfway
over
the
current
would
permit
no
more
wading
now
so
he
struck
out
confidently
to
swim
the
remaining
hundred
yards
he
swam
quartering
upstream
but
still
was
swept
downward
rather
faster
than
he
had
expected
however
he
reached
the
shore
finally
and
drifted
along
till
he
found
a
low
place
and
drew
himself
out
he
put
his
hand
on
his
jacket
pocket
found
his
piece
of
bark
safe
and
then
struck
through
the
woods
following
the
shore
with
streaming
garments
shortly
before
ten
o'clock
he
came
out
into
an
open
place
opposite
the
village
and
saw
the
ferryboat
lying
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
and
the
high
bank
everything
was
quiet
under
the
blinking
stars
he
crept
down
the
bank
watching
with
all
his
eyes
slipped
into
the
water
swam
three
or
four
strokes
and
climbed
into
the
skiff
that
did
yawl
duty
at
the
boat's
stern
he
laid
himself
down
under
the
thwarts
and
waited
panting
presently
the
cracked
bell
tapped
and
a
voice
gave
the
order
to
cast
off
a
minute
or
two
later
the
skiff's
head
was
standing
high
up
against
the
boat's
swell
and
the
voyage
was
begun
tom
felt
happy
in
his
success
for
he
knew
it
was
the
boat's
last
trip
for
the
night
at
the
end
of
a
long
twelve
or
fifteen
minutes
the
wheels
stopped
and
tom
slipped
overboard
and
swam
ashore
in
the
dusk
landing
fifty
yards
downstream
out
of
danger
of
possible
stragglers
he
flew
along
unfrequented
alleys
and
shortly
found
himself
at
his
aunt's
back
fence
he
climbed
over
approached
the
ell
and
looked
in
at
the
sitting
room
window
for
a
light
was
burning
there
there
sat
aunt
polly
sid
mary
and
joe
harper's
mother
grouped
together
talking
they
were
by
the
bed
and
the
bed
was
between
them
and
the
door
tom
went
to
the
door
and
began
to
softly
lift
the
latch
then
he
pressed
gently
and
the
door
yielded
a
crack
he
continued
pushing
cautiously
and
quaking
every
time
it
creaked
till
he
judged
he
might
squeeze
through
on
his
knees
so
he
put
his
head
through
and
began
warily
what
makes
the
candle
blow
so
said
aunt
polly
tom
hurried
up
why
that
door's
open
i
believe
why
of
course
it
is
no
end
of
strange
things
now
go
long
and
shut
it
sid
tom
disappeared
under
the
bed
just
in
time
he
lay
and
breathed
himself
for
a
time
and
then
crept
to
where
he
could
almost
touch
his
aunt's
foot
but
as
i
was
saying
said
aunt
polly
he
warn't
bad
so
to
say
only
misch
ee
vous
only
just
giddy
and
harum
scarum
you
know
he
warn't
any
more
responsible
than
a
colt
he
never
meant
any
harm
and
he
was
the
best
hearted
boy
that
ever
was
and
she
began
to
cry
it
was
just
so
with
my
joe
always
full
of
his
devilment
and
up
to
every
kind
of
mischief
but
he
was
just
as
unselfish
and
kind
as
he
could
be
and
laws
bless
me
to
think
i
went
and
whipped
him
for
taking
that
cream
never
once
recollecting
that
i
throwed
it
out
myself
because
it
was
sour
and
i
never
to
see
him
again
in
this
world
never
never
never
poor
abused
boy
and
mrs
harper
sobbed
as
if
her
heart
would
break
i
hope
tom's
better
off
where
he
is
said
sid
but
if
he'd
been
better
in
some
ways
sid
tom
felt
the
glare
of
the
old
lady's
eye
though
he
could
not
see
it
not
a
word
against
my
tom
now
that
he's
gone
god'll
take
care
of
him
never
you
trouble
your
self
sir
oh
mrs
harper
i
don't
know
how
to
give
him
up
i
don't
know
how
to
give
him
up
he
was
such
a
comfort
to
me
although
he
tormented
my
old
heart
out
of
me
most
the
lord
giveth
and
the
lord
hath
taken
away
blessed
be
the
name
of
the
lord
but
it's
so
hard
oh
it's
so
hard
only
last
saturday
my
joe
busted
a
firecracker
right
under
my
nose
and
i
knocked
him
sprawling
little
did
i
know
then
how
soon
oh
if
it
was
to
do
over
again
i'd
hug
him
and
bless
him
for
it
yes
yes
yes
i
know
just
how
you
feel
mrs
harper
i
know
just
exactly
how
you
feel
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
noon
my
tom
took
and
filled
the
cat
full
of
pain
killer
and
i
did
think
the
cretur
would
tear
the
house
down
and
god
forgive
me
i
cracked
tom's
head
with
my
thimble
poor
boy
poor
dead
boy
but
he's
out
of
all
his
troubles
now
and
the
last
words
i
ever
heard
him
say
was
to
reproach
but
this
memory
was
too
much
for
the
old
lady
and
she
broke
entirely
down
tom
was
snuffling
now
himself
and
more
in
pity
of
himself
than
anybody
else
he
could
hear
mary
crying
and
putting
in
a
kindly
word
for
him
from
time
to
time
he
began
to
have
a
nobler
opinion
of
himself
than
ever
before
still
he
was
sufficiently
touched
by
his
aunt's
grief
to
long
to
rush
out
from
under
the
bed
and
overwhelm
her
with
joy
and
the
theatrical
gorgeousness
of
the
thing
appealed
strongly
to
his
nature
too
but
he
resisted
and
lay
still
he
went
on
listening
and
gathered
by
odds
and
ends
that
it
was
conjectured
at
first
that
the
boys
had
got
drowned
while
taking
a
swim
then
the
small
raft
had
been
missed
next
certain
boys
said
the
missing
lads
had
promised
that
the
village
should
hear
something
soon
the
wise
heads
had
put
this
and
that
together
and
decided
that
the
lads
had
gone
off
on
that
raft
and
would
turn
up
at
the
next
town
below
presently
but
toward
noon
the
raft
had
been
found
lodged
against
the
missouri
shore
some
five
or
six
miles
below
the
village
and
then
hope
perished
they
must
be
drowned
else
hunger
would
have
driven
them
home
by
nightfall
if
not
sooner
it
was
believed
that
the
search
for
the
bodies
had
been
a
fruitless
effort
merely
because
the
drowning
must
have
occurred
in
mid
channel
since
the
boys
being
good
swimmers
would
otherwise
have
escaped
to
shore
this
was
wednesday
night
if
the
bodies
continued
missing
until
sunday
all
hope
would
be
given
over
and
the
funerals
would
be
preached
on
that
morning
tom
shuddered
mrs
harper
gave
a
sobbing
goodnight
and
turned
to
go
then
with
a
mutual
impulse
the
two
bereaved
women
flung
themselves
into
each
other's
arms
and
had
a
good
consoling
cry
and
then
parted
aunt
polly
was
tender
far
beyond
her
wont
in
her
goodnight
to
sid
and
mary
sid
snuffled
a
bit
and
mary
went
off
crying
with
all
her
heart
aunt
polly
knelt
down
and
prayed
for
tom
so
touchingly
so
appealingly
and
with
such
measureless
love
in
her
words
and
her
old
trembling
voice
that
he
was
weltering
in
tears
again
long
before
she
was
through
he
had
to
keep
still
long
after
she
went
to
bed
for
she
kept
making
broken
hearted
ejaculations
from
time
to
time
tossing
unrestfully
and
turning
over
but
at
last
she
was
still
only
moaning
a
little
in
her
sleep
now
the
boy
stole
out
rose
gradually
by
the
bedside
shaded
the
candle
light
with
his
hand
and
stood
regarding
her
his
heart
was
full
of
pity
for
her
he
took
out
his
sycamore
scroll
and
placed
it
by
the
candle
but
something
occurred
to
him
and
he
lingered
considering
his
face
lighted
with
a
happy
solution
of
his
thought
he
put
the
bark
hastily
in
his
pocket
then
he
bent
over
and
kissed
the
faded
lips
and
straightway
made
his
stealthy
exit
latching
the
door
behind
him
he
threaded
his
way
back
to
the
ferry
landing
found
nobody
at
large
there
and
walked
boldly
on
board
the
boat
for
he
knew
she
was
tenantless
except
that
there
was
a
watchman
who
always
turned
in
and
slept
like
a
graven
image
he
untied
the
skiff
at
the
stern
slipped
into
it
and
was
soon
rowing
cautiously
upstream
when
he
had
pulled
a
mile
above
the
village
he
started
quartering
across
and
bent
himself
stoutly
to
his
work
he
hit
the
landing
on
the
other
side
neatly
for
this
was
a
familiar
bit
of
work
to
him
he
was
moved
to
capture
the
skiff
arguing
that
it
might
be
considered
a
ship
and
therefore
legitimate
prey
for
a
pirate
but
he
knew
a
thorough
search
would
be
made
for
it
and
that
might
end
in
revelations
so
he
stepped
ashore
and
entered
the
woods
he
sat
down
and
took
a
long
rest
torturing
himself
meanwhile
to
keep
awake
and
then
started
warily
down
the
home
stretch
the
night
was
far
spent
it
was
broad
daylight
before
he
found
himself
fairly
abreast
the
island
bar
he
rested
again
until
the
sun
was
well
up
and
gilding
the
great
river
with
its
splendor
and
then
he
plunged
into
the
stream
a
little
later
he
paused
dripping
upon
the
threshold
of
the
camp
and
heard
joe
say
no
tom's
true
blue
huck
and
he'll
come
back
he
won't
desert
he
knows
that
would
be
a
disgrace
to
a
pirate
and
tom's
too
proud
for
that
sort
of
thing
he's
up
to
something
or
other
now
i
wonder
what
well
the
things
is
ours
anyway
ain't
they
pretty
near
but
not
yet
huck
the
writing
says
they
are
if
he
ain't
back
here
to
breakfast
which
he
is
exclaimed
tom
with
fine
dramatic
effect
stepping
grandly
into
camp
a
sumptuous
breakfast
of
bacon
and
fish
was
shortly
provided
and
as
the
boys
set
to
work
upon
it
tom
recounted
and
adorned
his
adventures
they
were
a
vain
and
boastful
company
of
heroes
when
the
tale
was
done
then
tom
hid
himself
away
in
a
shady
nook
to
sleep
till
noon
and
the
other
pirates
got
ready
to
fish
and
explore
chapter
xvi
after
dinner
all
the
gang
turned
out
to
hunt
for
turtle
eggs
on
the
bar
they
went
about
poking
sticks
into
the
sand
and
when
they
found
a
soft
place
they
went
down
on
their
knees
and
dug
with
their
hands
sometimes
they
would
take
fifty
or
sixty
eggs
out
of
one
hole
they
were
perfectly
round
white
things
a
trifle
smaller
than
an
english
walnut
they
had
a
famous
fried
egg
feast
that
night
and
another
on
friday
morning
after
breakfast
they
went
whooping
and
prancing
out
on
the
bar
and
chased
each
other
round
and
round
shedding
clothes
as
they
went
until
they
were
naked
and
then
continued
the
frolic
far
away
up
the
shoal
water
of
the
bar
against
the
stiff
current
which
latter
tripped
their
legs
from
under
them
from
time
to
time
and
greatly
increased
the
fun
and
now
and
then
they
stooped
in
a
group
and
splashed
water
in
each
other's
faces
with
their
palms
gradually
approaching
each
other
with
averted
faces
to
avoid
the
strangling
sprays
and
finally
gripping
and
struggling
till
the
best
man
ducked
his
neighbor
and
then
they
all
went
under
in
a
tangle
of
white
legs
and
arms
and
came
up
blowing
sputtering
laughing
and
gasping
for
breath
at
one
and
the
same
time
when
they
were
well
exhausted
they
would
run
out
and
sprawl
on
the
dry
hot
sand
and
lie
there
and
cover
themselves
up
with
it
and
by
and
by
break
for
the
water
again
and
go
through
the
original
performance
once
more
finally
it
occurred
to
them
that
their
naked
skin
represented
flesh
colored
tights
very
fairly
so
they
drew
a
ring
in
the
sand
and
had
a
circus
with
three
clowns
in
it
for
none
would
yield
this
proudest
post
to
his
neighbor
next
they
got
their
marbles
and
played
knucks
and
ringtaw
and
keeps
till
that
amusement
grew
stale
then
joe
and
huck
had
another
swim
but
tom
would
not
venture
because
he
found
that
in
kicking
off
his
trousers
he
had
kicked
his
string
of
rattlesnake
rattles
off
his
ankle
and
he
wondered
how
he
had
escaped
cramp
so
long
without
the
protection
of
this
mysterious
charm
he
did
not
venture
again
until
he
had
found
it
and
by
that
time
the
other
boys
were
tired
and
ready
to
rest
they
gradually
wandered
apart
dropped
into
the
dumps
and
fell
to
gazing
longingly
across
the
wide
river
to
where
the
village
lay
drowsing
in
the
sun
tom
found
himself
writing
becky
in
the
sand
with
his
big
toe
he
scratched
it
out
and
was
angry
with
himself
for
his
weakness
but
he
wrote
it
again
nevertheless
he
could
not
help
it
he
erased
it
once
more
and
then
took
himself
out
of
temptation
by
driving
the
other
boys
together
and
joining
them
but
joe's
spirits
had
gone
down
almost
beyond
resurrection
he
was
so
homesick
that
he
could
hardly
endure
the
misery
of
it
the
tears
lay
very
near
the
surface
huck
was
melancholy
too
tom
was
downhearted
but
tried
hard
not
to
show
it
he
had
a
secret
which
he
was
not
ready
to
tell
yet
but
if
this
mutinous
depression
was
not
broken
up
soon
he
would
have
to
bring
it
out
he
said
with
a
great
show
of
cheerfulness
i
bet
there's
been
pirates
on
this
island
before
boys
we'll
explore
it
again
they've
hid
treasures
here
somewhere
how'd
you
feel
to
light
on
a
rotten
chest
full
of
gold
and
silver
hey
but
it
roused
only
faint
enthusiasm
which
faded
out
with
no
reply
tom
tried
one
or
two
other
seductions
but
they
failed
too
it
was
discouraging
work
joe
sat
poking
up
the
sand
with
a
stick
and
looking
very
gloomy
finally
he
said
oh
boys
let's
give
it
up
i
want
to
go
home
it's
so
lonesome
oh
no
joe
you'll
feel
better
by
and
by
said
tom
just
think
of
the
fishing
that's
here
i
don't
care
for
fishing
i
want
to
go
home
but
joe
there
ain't
such
another
swimming
place
anywhere
swimming's
no
good
i
don't
seem
to
care
for
it
somehow
when
there
ain't
anybody
to
say
i
sha'n't
go
in
i
mean
to
go
home
oh
shucks
baby
you
want
to
see
your
mother
i
reckon
yes
i
do
want
to
see
my
mother
and
you
would
too
if
you
had
one
i
ain't
any
more
baby
than
you
are
and
joe
snuffled
a
little
well
we'll
let
the
crybaby
go
home
to
his
mother
won't
we
huck
poor
thing
does
it
want
to
see
its
mother
and
so
it
shall
you
like
it
here
don't
you
huck
we'll
stay
won't
we
huck
said
y
e
s
without
any
heart
in
it
i'll
never
speak
to
you
again
as
long
as
i
live
said
joe
rising
there
now
and
he
moved
moodily
away
and
began
to
dress
himself
who
cares
said
tom
nobody
wants
you
to
go
long
home
and
get
laughed
at
oh
you're
a
nice
pirate
huck
and
me
ain't
crybabies
we'll
stay
won't
we
huck
let
him
go
if
he
wants
to
i
reckon
we
can
get
along
without
him
per'aps
but
tom
was
uneasy
nevertheless
and
was
alarmed
to
see
joe
go
sullenly
on
with
his
dressing
and
then
it
was
discomforting
to
see
huck
eying
joe's
preparations
so
wistfully
and
keeping
up
such
an
ominous
silence
presently
without
a
parting
word
joe
began
to
wade
off
toward
the
illinois
shore
tom's
heart
began
to
sink
he
glanced
at
huck
huck
could
not
bear
the
look
and
dropped
his
eyes
then
he
said
i
want
to
go
too
tom
it
was
getting
so
lonesome
anyway
and
now
it'll
be
worse
let's
us
go
too
tom
i
won't
you
can
all
go
if
you
want
to
i
mean
to
stay
tom
i
better
go
well
go
long
who's
hendering
you
huck
began
to
pick
up
his
scattered
clothes
he
said
tom
i
wisht
you'd
come
too
now
you
think
it
over
we'll
wait
for
you
when
we
get
to
shore
well
you'll
wait
a
blame
long
time
that's
all
huck
started
sorrowfully
away
and
tom
stood
looking
after
him
with
a
strong
desire
tugging
at
his
heart
to
yield
his
pride
and
go
along
too
he
hoped
the
boys
would
stop
but
they
still
waded
slowly
on
it
suddenly
dawned
on
tom
that
it
was
become
very
lonely
and
still
he
made
one
final
struggle
with
his
pride
and
then
darted
after
his
comrades
yelling
wait
wait
i
want
to
tell
you
something
they
presently
stopped
and
turned
around
when
he
got
to
where
they
were
he
began
unfolding
his
secret
and
they
listened
moodily
till
at
last
they
saw
the
point
he
was
driving
at
and
then
they
set
up
a
warwhoop
of
applause
and
said
it
was
splendid
and
said
if
he
had
told
them
at
first
they
wouldn't
have
started
away
he
made
a
plausible
excuse
but
his
real
reason
had
been
the
fear
that
not
even
the
secret
would
keep
them
with
him
any
very
great
length
of
time
and
so
he
had
meant
to
hold
it
in
reserve
as
a
last
seduction
the
lads
came
gayly
back
and
went
at
their
sports
again
with
a
will
chattering
all
the
time
about
tom's
stupendous
plan
and
admiring
the
genius
of
it
after
a
dainty
egg
and
fish
dinner
tom
said
he
wanted
to
learn
to
smoke
now
joe
caught
at
the
idea
and
said
he
would
like
to
try
too
so
huck
made
pipes
and
filled
them
these
novices
had
never
smoked
anything
before
but
cigars
made
of
grapevine
and
they
bit
the
tongue
and
were
not
considered
manly
anyway
now
they
stretched
themselves
out
on
their
elbows
and
began
to
puff
charily
and
with
slender
confidence
the
smoke
had
an
unpleasant
taste
and
they
gagged
a
little
but
tom
said
why
it's
just
as
easy
if
i'd
a
knowed
this
was
all
i'd
a
learnt
long
ago
so
would
i
said
joe
it's
just
nothing
why
many
a
time
i've
looked
at
people
smoking
and
thought
well
i
wish
i
could
do
that
but
i
never
thought
i
could
said
tom
that's
just
the
way
with
me
hain't
it
huck
you've
heard
me
talk
just
that
way
haven't
you
huck
i'll
leave
it
to
huck
if
i
haven't
yes
heaps
of
times
said
huck
well
i
have
too
said
tom
oh
hundreds
of
times
once
down
by
the
slaughter
house
don't
you
remember
huck
bob
tanner
was
there
and
johnny
miller
and
jeff
thatcher
when
i
said
it
don't
you
remember
huck
bout
me
saying
that
yes
that's
so
said
huck
that
was
the
day
after
i
lost
a
white
alley
no
twas
the
day
before
there
i
told
you
so
said
tom
huck
recollects
it
i
bleeve
i
could
smoke
this
pipe
all
day
said
joe
i
don't
feel
sick
neither
do
i
said
tom
i
could
smoke
it
all
day
but
i
bet
you
jeff
thatcher
couldn't
jeff
thatcher
why
he'd
keel
over
just
with
two
draws
just
let
him
try
it
once
he'd
see
i
bet
he
would
and
johnny
miller
i
wish
could
see
johnny
miller
tackle
it
once
oh
don't
i
said
joe
why
i
bet
you
johnny
miller
couldn't
any
more
do
this
than
nothing
just
one
little
snifter
would
fetch
him
deed
it
would
joe
say
i
wish
the
boys
could
see
us
now
so
do
i
say
boys
don't
say
anything
about
it
and
some
time
when
they're
around
i'll
come
up
to
you
and
say
joe
got
a
pipe
i
want
a
smoke
and
you'll
say
kind
of
careless
like
as
if
it
warn't
anything
you'll
say
yes
i
got
my
old
pipe
and
another
one
but
my
tobacker
ain't
very
good
and
i'll
say
oh
that's
all
right
if
it's
strong
enough
and
then
you'll
out
with
the
pipes
and
we'll
light
up
just
as
ca'm
and
then
just
see
em
look
by
jings
that'll
be
gay
tom
i
wish
it
was
now
so
do
i
and
when
we
tell
em
we
learned
when
we
was
off
pirating
won't
they
wish
they'd
been
along
oh
i
reckon
not
i'll
just
bet
they
will
so
the
talk
ran
on
but
presently
it
began
to
flag
a
trifle
and
grow
disjointed
the
silences
widened
the
expectoration
marvellously
increased
every
pore
inside
the
boys
cheeks
became
a
spouting
fountain
they
could
scarcely
bail
out
the
cellars
under
their
tongues
fast
enough
to
prevent
an
inundation
little
overflowings
down
their
throats
occurred
in
spite
of
all
they
could
do
and
sudden
retchings
followed
every
time
both
boys
were
looking
very
pale
and
miserable
now
joe's
pipe
dropped
from
his
nerveless
fingers
tom's
followed
both
fountains
were
going
furiously
and
both
pumps
bailing
with
might
and
main
joe
said
feebly
i've
lost
my
knife
i
reckon
i
better
go
and
find
it
tom
said
with
quivering
lips
and
halting
utterance
i'll
help
you
you
go
over
that
way
and
i'll
hunt
around
by
the
spring
no
you
needn't
come
huck
we
can
find
it
so
huck
sat
down
again
and
waited
an
hour
then
he
found
it
lonesome
and
went
to
find
his
comrades
they
were
wide
apart
in
the
woods
both
very
pale
both
fast
asleep
but
something
informed
him
that
if
they
had
had
any
trouble
they
had
got
rid
of
it
they
were
not
talkative
at
supper
that
night
they
had
a
humble
look
and
when
huck
prepared
his
pipe
after
the
meal
and
was
going
to
prepare
theirs
they
said
no
they
were
not
feeling
very
well
something
they
ate
at
dinner
had
disagreed
with
them
about
midnight
joe
awoke
and
called
the
boys
there
was
a
brooding
oppressiveness
in
the
air
that
seemed
to
bode
something
the
boys
huddled
themselves
together
and
sought
the
friendly
companionship
of
the
fire
though
the
dull
dead
heat
of
the
breathless
atmosphere
was
stifling
they
sat
still
intent
and
waiting
the
solemn
hush
continued
beyond
the
light
of
the
fire
everything
was
swallowed
up
in
the
blackness
of
darkness
presently
there
came
a
quivering
glow
that
vaguely
revealed
the
foliage
for
a
moment
and
then
vanished
by
and
by
another
came
a
little
stronger
then
another
then
a
faint
moan
came
sighing
through
the
branches
of
the
forest
and
the
boys
felt
a
fleeting
breath
upon
their
cheeks
and
shuddered
with
the
fancy
that
the
spirit
of
the
night
had
gone
by
there
was
a
pause
now
a
weird
flash
turned
night
into
day
and
showed
every
little
grassblade
separate
and
distinct
that
grew
about
their
feet
and
it
showed
three
white
startled
faces
too
a
deep
peal
of
thunder
went
rolling
and
tumbling
down
the
heavens
and
lost
itself
in
sullen
rumblings
in
the
distance
a
sweep
of
chilly
air
passed
by
rustling
all
the
leaves
and
snowing
the
flaky
ashes
broadcast
about
the
fire
another
fierce
glare
lit
up
the
forest
and
an
instant
crash
followed
that
seemed
to
rend
the
treetops
right
over
the
boys
heads
they
clung
together
in
terror
in
the
thick
gloom
that
followed
a
few
big
raindrops
fell
pattering
upon
the
leaves
quick
boys
go
for
the
tent
exclaimed
tom
they
sprang
away
stumbling
over
roots
and
among
vines
in
the
dark
no
two
plunging
in
the
same
direction
a
furious
blast
roared
through
the
trees
making
everything
sing
as
it
went
one
blinding
flash
after
another
came
and
peal
on
peal
of
deafening
thunder
and
now
a
drenching
rain
poured
down
and
the
rising
hurricane
drove
it
in
sheets
along
the
ground
the
boys
cried
out
to
each
other
but
the
roaring
wind
and
the
booming
thunderblasts
drowned
their
voices
utterly
however
one
by
one
they
straggled
in
at
last
and
took
shelter
under
the
tent
cold
scared
and
streaming
with
water
but
to
have
company
in
misery
seemed
something
to
be
grateful
for
they
could
not
talk
the
old
sail
flapped
so
furiously
even
if
the
other
noises
would
have
allowed
them
the
tempest
rose
higher
and
higher
and
presently
the
sail
tore
loose
from
its
fastenings
and
went
winging
away
on
the
blast
the
boys
seized
each
others
hands
and
fled
with
many
tumblings
and
bruises
to
the
shelter
of
a
great
oak
that
stood
upon
the
riverbank
now
the
battle
was
at
its
highest
under
the
ceaseless
conflagration
of
lightning
that
flamed
in
the
skies
everything
below
stood
out
in
cleancut
and
shadowless
distinctness
the
bending
trees
the
billowy
river
white
with
foam
the
driving
spray
of
spumeflakes
the
dim
outlines
of
the
high
bluffs
on
the
other
side
glimpsed
through
the
drifting
cloudrack
and
the
slanting
veil
of
rain
every
little
while
some
giant
tree
yielded
the
fight
and
fell
crashing
through
the
younger
growth
and
the
unflagging
thunderpeals
came
now
in
ear
splitting
explosive
bursts
keen
and
sharp
and
unspeakably
appalling
the
storm
culminated
in
one
matchless
effort
that
seemed
likely
to
tear
the
island
to
pieces
burn
it
up
drown
it
to
the
treetops
blow
it
away
and
deafen
every
creature
in
it
all
at
one
and
the
same
moment
it
was
a
wild
night
for
homeless
young
heads
to
be
out
in
but
at
last
the
battle
was
done
and
the
forces
retired
with
weaker
and
weaker
threatenings
and
grumblings
and
peace
resumed
her
sway
the
boys
went
back
to
camp
a
good
deal
awed
but
they
found
there
was
still
something
to
be
thankful
for
because
the
great
sycamore
the
shelter
of
their
beds
was
a
ruin
now
blasted
by
the
lightnings
and
they
were
not
under
it
when
the
catastrophe
happened
everything
in
camp
was
drenched
the
campfire
as
well
for
they
were
but
heedless
lads
like
their
generation
and
had
made
no
provision
against
rain
here
was
matter
for
dismay
for
they
were
soaked
through
and
chilled
they
were
eloquent
in
their
distress
but
they
presently
discovered
that
the
fire
had
eaten
so
far
up
under
the
great
log
it
had
been
built
against
where
it
curved
upward
and
separated
itself
from
the
ground
that
a
handbreadth
or
so
of
it
had
escaped
wetting
so
they
patiently
wrought
until
with
shreds
and
bark
gathered
from
the
under
sides
of
sheltered
logs
they
coaxed
the
fire
to
burn
again
then
they
piled
on
great
dead
boughs
till
they
had
a
roaring
furnace
and
were
gladhearted
once
more
they
dried
their
boiled
ham
and
had
a
feast
and
after
that
they
sat
by
the
fire
and
expanded
and
glorified
their
midnight
adventure
until
morning
for
there
was
not
a
dry
spot
to
sleep
on
anywhere
around
as
the
sun
began
to
steal
in
upon
the
boys
drowsiness
came
over
them
and
they
went
out
on
the
sandbar
and
lay
down
to
sleep
they
got
scorched
out
by
and
by
and
drearily
set
about
getting
breakfast
after
the
meal
they
felt
rusty
and
stiff
jointed
and
a
little
homesick
once
more
tom
saw
the
signs
and
fell
to
cheering
up
the
pirates
as
well
as
he
could
but
they
cared
nothing
for
marbles
or
circus
or
swimming
or
anything
he
reminded
them
of
the
imposing
secret
and
raised
a
ray
of
cheer
while
it
lasted
he
got
them
interested
in
a
new
device
this
was
to
knock
off
being
pirates
for
a
while
and
be
indians
for
a
change
they
were
attracted
by
this
idea
so
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
stripped
and
striped
from
head
to
heel
with
black
mud
like
so
many
zebras
all
of
them
chiefs
of
course
and
then
they
went
tearing
through
the
woods
to
attack
an
english
settlement
by
and
by
they
separated
into
three
hostile
tribes
and
darted
upon
each
other
from
ambush
with
dreadful
warwhoops
and
killed
and
scalped
each
other
by
thousands
it
was
a
gory
day
consequently
it
was
an
extremely
satisfactory
one
they
assembled
in
camp
toward
suppertime
hungry
and
happy
but
now
a
difficulty
arose
hostile
indians
could
not
break
the
bread
of
hospitality
together
without
first
making
peace
and
this
was
a
simple
impossibility
without
smoking
a
pipe
of
peace
there
was
no
other
process
that
ever
they
had
heard
of
two
of
the
savages
almost
wished
they
had
remained
pirates
however
there
was
no
other
way
so
with
such
show
of
cheerfulness
as
they
could
muster
they
called
for
the
pipe
and
took
their
whiff
as
it
passed
in
due
form
and
behold
they
were
glad
they
had
gone
into
savagery
for
they
had
gained
something
they
found
that
they
could
now
smoke
a
little
without
having
to
go
and
hunt
for
a
lost
knife
they
did
not
get
sick
enough
to
be
seriously
uncomfortable
they
were
not
likely
to
fool
away
this
high
promise
for
lack
of
effort
no
they
practised
cautiously
after
supper
with
right
fair
success
and
so
they
spent
a
jubilant
evening
they
were
prouder
and
happier
in
their
new
acquirement
than
they
would
have
been
in
the
scalping
and
skinning
of
the
six
nations
we
will
leave
them
to
smoke
and
chatter
and
brag
since
we
have
no
further
use
for
them
at
present
chapter
xvii
but
there
was
no
hilarity
in
the
little
town
that
same
tranquil
saturday
afternoon
the
harpers
and
aunt
polly's
family
were
being
put
into
mourning
with
great
grief
and
many
tears
an
unusual
quiet
possessed
the
village
although
it
was
ordinarily
quiet
enough
in
all
conscience
the
villagers
conducted
their
concerns
with
an
absent
air
and
talked
little
but
they
sighed
often
the
saturday
holiday
seemed
a
burden
to
the
children
they
had
no
heart
in
their
sports
and
gradually
gave
them
up
in
the
afternoon
becky
thatcher
found
herself
moping
about
the
deserted
schoolhouse
yard
and
feeling
very
melancholy
but
she
found
nothing
there
to
comfort
her
she
soliloquized
oh
if
i
only
had
a
brass
andiron
knob
again
but
i
haven't
got
anything
now
to
remember
him
by
and
she
choked
back
a
little
sob
presently
she
stopped
and
said
to
herself
it
was
right
here
oh
if
it
was
to
do
over
again
i
wouldn't
say
that
i
wouldn't
say
it
for
the
whole
world
but
he's
gone
now
i'll
never
never
never
see
him
any
more
this
thought
broke
her
down
and
she
wandered
away
with
tears
rolling
down
her
cheeks
then
quite
a
group
of
boys
and
girls
playmates
of
tom's
and
joe's
came
by
and
stood
looking
over
the
paling
fence
and
talking
in
reverent
tones
of
how
tom
did
so
and
so
the
last
time
they
saw
him
and
how
joe
said
this
and
that
small
trifle
pregnant
with
awful
prophecy
as
they
could
easily
see
now
and
each
speaker
pointed
out
the
exact
spot
where
the
lost
lads
stood
at
the
time
and
then
added
something
like
and
i
was
a
standing
just
so
just
as
i
am
now
and
as
if
you
was
him
i
was
as
close
as
that
and
he
smiled
just
this
way
and
then
something
seemed
to
go
all
over
me
like
awful
you
know
and
i
never
thought
what
it
meant
of
course
but
i
can
see
now
then
there
was
a
dispute
about
who
saw
the
dead
boys
last
in
life
and
many
claimed
that
dismal
distinction
and
offered
evidences
more
or
less
tampered
with
by
the
witness
and
when
it
was
ultimately
decided
who
did
see
the
departed
last
and
exchanged
the
last
words
with
them
the
lucky
parties
took
upon
themselves
a
sort
of
sacred
importance
and
were
gaped
at
and
envied
by
all
the
rest
one
poor
chap
who
had
no
other
grandeur
to
offer
said
with
tolerably
manifest
pride
in
the
remembrance
well
tom
sawyer
he
licked
me
once
but
that
bid
for
glory
was
a
failure
most
of
the
boys
could
say
that
and
so
that
cheapened
the
distinction
too
much
the
group
loitered
away
still
recalling
memories
of
the
lost
heroes
in
awed
voices
when
the
sunday
school
hour
was
finished
the
next
morning
the
bell
began
to
toll
instead
of
ringing
in
the
usual
way
it
was
a
very
still
sabbath
and
the
mournful
sound
seemed
in
keeping
with
the
musing
hush
that
lay
upon
nature
the
villagers
began
to
gather
loitering
a
moment
in
the
vestibule
to
converse
in
whispers
about
the
sad
event
but
there
was
no
whispering
in
the
house
only
the
funereal
rustling
of
dresses
as
the
women
gathered
to
their
seats
disturbed
the
silence
there
none
could
remember
when
the
little
church
had
been
so
full
before
there
was
finally
a
waiting
pause
an
expectant
dumbness
and
then
aunt
polly
entered
followed
by
sid
and
mary
and
they
by
the
harper
family
all
in
deep
black
and
the
whole
congregation
the
old
minister
as
well
rose
reverently
and
stood
until
the
mourners
were
seated
in
the
front
pew
there
was
another
communing
silence
broken
at
intervals
by
muffled
sobs
and
then
the
minister
spread
his
hands
abroad
and
prayed
a
moving
hymn
was
sung
and
the
text
followed
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
as
the
service
proceeded
the
clergyman
drew
such
pictures
of
the
graces
the
winning
ways
and
the
rare
promise
of
the
lost
lads
that
every
soul
there
thinking
he
recognized
these
pictures
felt
a
pang
in
remembering
that
he
had
persistently
blinded
himself
to
them
always
before
and
had
as
persistently
seen
only
faults
and
flaws
in
the
poor
boys
the
minister
related
many
a
touching
incident
in
the
lives
of
the
departed
too
which
illustrated
their
sweet
generous
natures
and
the
people
could
easily
see
now
how
noble
and
beautiful
those
episodes
were
and
remembered
with
grief
that
at
the
time
they
occurred
they
had
seemed
rank
rascalities
well
deserving
of
the
cowhide
the
congregation
became
more
and
more
moved
as
the
pathetic
tale
went
on
till
at
last
the
whole
company
broke
down
and
joined
the
weeping
mourners
in
a
chorus
of
anguished
sobs
the
preacher
himself
giving
way
to
his
feelings
and
crying
in
the
pulpit
there
was
a
rustle
in
the
gallery
which
nobody
noticed
a
moment
later
the
church
door
creaked
the
minister
raised
his
streaming
eyes
above
his
handkerchief
and
stood
transfixed
first
one
and
then
another
pair
of
eyes
followed
the
minister's
and
then
almost
with
one
impulse
the
congregation
rose
and
stared
while
the
three
dead
boys
came
marching
up
the
aisle
tom
in
the
lead
joe
next
and
huck
a
ruin
of
drooping
rags
sneaking
sheepishly
in
the
rear
they
had
been
hid
in
the
unused
gallery
listening
to
their
own
funeral
sermon
aunt
polly
mary
and
the
harpers
threw
themselves
upon
their
restored
ones
smothered
them
with
kisses
and
poured
out
thanksgivings
while
poor
huck
stood
abashed
and
uncomfortable
not
knowing
exactly
what
to
do
or
where
to
hide
from
so
many
unwelcoming
eyes
he
wavered
and
started
to
slink
away
but
tom
seized
him
and
said
aunt
polly
it
ain't
fair
somebody's
got
to
be
glad
to
see
huck
and
so
they
shall
i'm
glad
to
see
him
poor
motherless
thing
and
the
loving
attentions
aunt
polly
lavished
upon
him
were
the
one
thing
capable
of
making
him
more
uncomfortable
than
he
was
before
suddenly
the
minister
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
praise
god
from
whom
all
blessings
flow
sing
and
put
your
hearts
in
it
and
they
did
old
hundred
swelled
up
with
a
triumphant
burst
and
while
it
shook
the
rafters
tom
sawyer
the
pirate
looked
around
upon
the
envying
juveniles
about
him
and
confessed
in
his
heart
that
this
was
the
proudest
moment
of
his
life
as
the
sold
congregation
trooped
out
they
said
they
would
almost
be
willing
to
be
made
ridiculous
again
to
hear
old
hundred
sung
like
that
once
more
tom
got
more
cuffs
and
kisses
that
day
according
to
aunt
polly's
varying
moods
than
he
had
earned
before
in
a
year
and
he
hardly
knew
which
expressed
the
most
gratefulness
to
god
and
affection
for
himself
chapter
xviii
that
was
tom's
great
secret
the
scheme
to
return
home
with
his
brother
pirates
and
attend
their
own
funerals
they
had
paddled
over
to
the
missouri
shore
on
a
log
at
dusk
on
saturday
landing
five
or
six
miles
below
the
village
they
had
slept
in
the
woods
at
the
edge
of
the
town
till
nearly
daylight
and
had
then
crept
through
back
lanes
and
alleys
and
finished
their
sleep
in
the
gallery
of
the
church
among
a
chaos
of
invalided
benches
at
breakfast
monday
morning
aunt
polly
and
mary
were
very
loving
to
tom
and
very
attentive
to
his
wants
there
was
an
unusual
amount
of
talk
in
the
course
of
it
aunt
polly
said
well
i
don't
say
it
wasn't
a
fine
joke
tom
to
keep
everybody
suffering
most
a
week
so
you
boys
had
a
good
time
but
it
is
a
pity
you
could
be
so
hard
hearted
as
to
let
me
suffer
so
if
you
could
come
over
on
a
log
to
go
to
your
funeral
you
could
have
come
over
and
give
me
a
hint
some
way
that
you
warn't
dead
but
only
run
off
yes
you
could
have
done
that
tom
said
mary
and
i
believe
you
would
if
you
had
thought
of
it
would
you
tom
said
aunt
polly
her
face
lighting
wistfully
say
now
would
you
if
you'd
thought
of
it
i
well
i
don't
know
twould
a
spoiled
everything
tom
i
hoped
you
loved
me
that
much
said
aunt
polly
with
a
grieved
tone
that
discomforted
the
boy
it
would
have
been
something
if
you'd
cared
enough
to
think
of
it
even
if
you
didn't
do
it
now
auntie
that
ain't
any
harm
pleaded
mary
it's
only
tom's
giddy
way
he
is
always
in
such
a
rush
that
he
never
thinks
of
anything
more's
the
pity
sid
would
have
thought
and
sid
would
have
come
and
done
it
too
tom
you'll
look
back
some
day
when
it's
too
late
and
wish
you'd
cared
a
little
more
for
me
when
it
would
have
cost
you
so
little
now
auntie
you
know
i
do
care
for
you
said
tom
i'd
know
it
better
if
you
acted
more
like
it
i
wish
now
i'd
thought
said
tom
with
a
repentant
tone
but
i
dreamt
about
you
anyway
that's
something
ain't
it
it
ain't
much
a
cat
does
that
much
but
it's
better
than
nothing
what
did
you
dream
why
wednesday
night
i
dreamt
that
you
was
sitting
over
there
by
the
bed
and
sid
was
sitting
by
the
woodbox
and
mary
next
to
him
well
so
we
did
so
we
always
do
i'm
glad
your
dreams
could
take
even
that
much
trouble
about
us
and
i
dreamt
that
joe
harper's
mother
was
here
why
she
was
here
did
you
dream
any
more
oh
lots
but
it's
so
dim
now
well
try
to
recollect
can't
you
somehow
it
seems
to
me
that
the
wind
the
wind
blowed
the
the
try
harder
tom
the
wind
did
blow
something
come
tom
pressed
his
fingers
on
his
forehead
an
anxious
minute
and
then
said
i've
got
it
now
i've
got
it
now
it
blowed
the
candle
mercy
on
us
go
on
tom
go
on
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
said
why
i
believe
that
that
door
go
on
tom
just
let
me
study
a
moment
just
a
moment
oh
yes
you
said
you
believed
the
door
was
open
as
i'm
sitting
here
i
did
didn't
i
mary
go
on
and
then
and
then
well
i
won't
be
certain
but
it
seems
like
as
if
you
made
sid
go
and
and
well
well
what
did
i
make
him
do
tom
what
did
i
make
him
do
you
made
him
you
oh
you
made
him
shut
it
well
for
the
land's
sake
i
never
heard
the
beat
of
that
in
all
my
days
don't
tell
me
there
ain't
anything
in
dreams
any
more
sereny
harper
shall
know
of
this
before
i'm
an
hour
older
i'd
like
to
see
her
get
around
this
with
her
rubbage
bout
superstition
go
on
tom
oh
it's
all
getting
just
as
bright
as
day
now
next
you
said
i
warn't
bad
only
mischeevous
and
harum
scarum
and
not
any
more
responsible
than
than
i
think
it
was
a
colt
or
something
and
so
it
was
well
goodness
gracious
go
on
tom
and
then
you
began
to
cry
so
i
did
so
i
did
not
the
first
time
neither
and
then
then
mrs
harper
she
began
to
cry
and
said
joe
was
just
the
same
and
she
wished
she
hadn't
whipped
him
for
taking
cream
when
she'd
throwed
it
out
her
own
self
tom
the
sperrit
was
upon
you
you
was
a
prophesying
that's
what
you
was
doing
land
alive
go
on
tom
then
sid
he
said
he
said
i
don't
think
i
said
anything
said
sid
yes
you
did
sid
said
mary
shut
your
heads
and
let
tom
go
on
what
did
he
say
tom
he
said
i
think
he
said
he
hoped
i
was
better
off
where
i
was
gone
to
but
if
i'd
been
better
sometimes
there
d'you
hear
that
it
was
his
very
words
and
you
shut
him
up
sharp
i
lay
i
did
there
must
a
been
an
angel
there
there
was
an
angel
there
somewheres
and
mrs
harper
told
about
joe
scaring
her
with
a
firecracker
and
you
told
about
peter
and
the
pain
killer
just
as
true
as
i
live
and
then
there
was
a
whole
lot
of
talk
bout
dragging
the
river
for
us
and
bout
having
the
funeral
sunday
and
then
you
and
old
miss
harper
hugged
and
cried
and
she
went
it
happened
just
so
it
happened
just
so
as
sure
as
i'm
a
sitting
in
these
very
tracks
tom
you
couldn't
told
it
more
like
if
you'd
a
seen
it
and
then
what
go
on
tom
then
i
thought
you
prayed
for
me
and
i
could
see
you
and
hear
every
word
you
said
and
you
went
to
bed
and
i
was
so
sorry
that
i
took
and
wrote
on
a
piece
of
sycamore
bark
we
ain't
dead
we
are
only
off
being
pirates
and
put
it
on
the
table
by
the
candle
and
then
you
looked
so
good
laying
there
asleep
that
i
thought
i
went
and
leaned
over
and
kissed
you
on
the
lips
did
you
tom
did
you
i
just
forgive
you
everything
for
that
and
she
seized
the
boy
in
a
crushing
embrace
that
made
him
feel
like
the
guiltiest
of
villains
it
was
very
kind
even
though
it
was
only
a
dream
sid
soliloquized
just
audibly
shut
up
sid
a
body
does
just
the
same
in
a
dream
as
he'd
do
if
he
was
awake
here's
a
big
milum
apple
i've
been
saving
for
you
tom
if
you
was
ever
found
again
now
go
long
to
school
i'm
thankful
to
the
good
god
and
father
of
us
all
i've
got
you
back
that's
long
suffering
and
merciful
to
them
that
believe
on
him
and
keep
his
word
though
goodness
knows
i'm
unworthy
of
it
but
if
only
the
worthy
ones
got
his
blessings
and
had
his
hand
to
help
them
over
the
rough
places
there's
few
enough
would
smile
here
or
ever
enter
into
his
rest
when
the
long
night
comes
go
long
sid
mary
tom
take
yourselves
off
you've
hendered
me
long
enough
the
children
left
for
school
and
the
old
lady
to
call
on
mrs
harper
and
vanquish
her
realism
with
tom's
marvellous
dream
sid
had
better
judgment
than
to
utter
the
thought
that
was
in
his
mind
as
he
left
the
house
it
was
this
pretty
thin
as
long
a
dream
as
that
without
any
mistakes
in
it
what
a
hero
tom
was
become
now
he
did
not
go
skipping
and
prancing
but
moved
with
a
dignified
swagger
as
became
a
pirate
who
felt
that
the
public
eye
was
on
him
and
indeed
it
was
he
tried
not
to
seem
to
see
the
looks
or
hear
the
remarks
as
he
passed
along
but
they
were
food
and
drink
to
him
smaller
boys
than
himself
flocked
at
his
heels
as
proud
to
be
seen
with
him
and
tolerated
by
him
as
if
he
had
been
the
drummer
at
the
head
of
a
procession
or
the
elephant
leading
a
menagerie
into
town
boys
of
his
own
size
pretended
not
to
know
he
had
been
away
at
all
but
they
were
consuming
with
envy
nevertheless
they
would
have
given
anything
to
have
that
swarthy
sun
tanned
skin
of
his
and
his
glittering
notoriety
and
tom
would
not
have
parted
with
either
for
a
circus
at
school
the
children
made
so
much
of
him
and
of
joe
and
delivered
such
eloquent
admiration
from
their
eyes
that
the
two
heroes
were
not
long
in
becoming
insufferably
stuck
up
they
began
to
tell
their
adventures
to
hungry
listeners
but
they
only
began
it
was
not
a
thing
likely
to
have
an
end
with
imaginations
like
theirs
to
furnish
material
and
finally
when
they
got
out
their
pipes
and
went
serenely
puffing
around
the
very
summit
of
glory
was
reached
tom
decided
that
he
could
be
independent
of
becky
thatcher
now
glory
was
sufficient
he
would
live
for
glory
now
that
he
was
distinguished
maybe
she
would
be
wanting
to
make
up
well
let
her
she
should
see
that
he
could
be
as
indifferent
as
some
other
people
presently
she
arrived
tom
pretended
not
to
see
her
he
moved
away
and
joined
a
group
of
boys
and
girls
and
began
to
talk
soon
he
observed
that
she
was
tripping
gayly
back
and
forth
with
flushed
face
and
dancing
eyes
pretending
to
be
busy
chasing
schoolmates
and
screaming
with
laughter
when
she
made
a
capture
but
he
noticed
that
she
always
made
her
captures
in
his
vicinity
and
that
she
seemed
to
cast
a
conscious
eye
in
his
direction
at
such
times
too
it
gratified
all
the
vicious
vanity
that
was
in
him
and
so
instead
of
winning
him
it
only
set
him
up
the
more
and
made
him
the
more
diligent
to
avoid
betraying
that
he
knew
she
was
about
presently
she
gave
over
skylarking
and
moved
irresolutely
about
sighing
once
or
twice
and
glancing
furtively
and
wistfully
toward
tom
then
she
observed
that
now
tom
was
talking
more
particularly
to
amy
lawrence
than
to
any
one
else
she
felt
a
sharp
pang
and
grew
disturbed
and
uneasy
at
once
she
tried
to
go
away
but
her
feet
were
treacherous
and
carried
her
to
the
group
instead
she
said
to
a
girl
almost
at
tom's
elbow
with
sham
vivacity
why
mary
austin
you
bad
girl
why
didn't
you
come
to
sunday
school
i
did
come
didn't
you
see
me
why
no
did
you
where
did
you
sit
i
was
in
miss
peters
class
where
i
always
go
i
saw
you
did
you
why
it's
funny
i
didn't
see
you
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
the
picnic
oh
that's
jolly
who's
going
to
give
it
my
ma's
going
to
let
me
have
one
oh
goody
i
hope
she'll
let
me
come
well
she
will
the
picnic's
for
me
she'll
let
anybody
come
that
i
want
and
i
want
you
that's
ever
so
nice
when
is
it
going
to
be
by
and
by
maybe
about
vacation
oh
won't
it
be
fun
you
going
to
have
all
the
girls
and
boys
yes
every
one
that's
friends
to
me
or
wants
to
be
and
she
glanced
ever
so
furtively
at
tom
but
he
talked
right
along
to
amy
lawrence
about
the
terrible
storm
on
the
island
and
how
the
lightning
tore
the
great
sycamore
tree
all
to
flinders
while
he
was
standing
within
three
feet
of
it
oh
may
i
come
said
grace
miller
yes
and
me
said
sally
rogers
yes
and
me
too
said
susy
harper
and
joe
yes
and
so
on
with
clapping
of
joyful
hands
till
all
the
group
had
begged
for
invitations
but
tom
and
amy
then
tom
turned
coolly
away
still
talking
and
took
amy
with
him
becky's
lips
trembled
and
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes
she
hid
these
signs
with
a
forced
gayety
and
went
on
chattering
but
the
life
had
gone
out
of
the
picnic
now
and
out
of
everything
else
she
got
away
as
soon
as
she
could
and
hid
herself
and
had
what
her
sex
call
a
good
cry
then
she
sat
moody
with
wounded
pride
till
the
bell
rang
she
roused
up
now
with
a
vindictive
cast
in
her
eye
and
gave
her
plaited
tails
a
shake
and
said
she
knew
what
she'd
do
at
recess
tom
continued
his
flirtation
with
amy
with
jubilant
self
satisfaction
and
he
kept
drifting
about
to
find
becky
and
lacerate
her
with
the
performance
at
last
he
spied
her
but
there
was
a
sudden
falling
of
his
mercury
she
was
sitting
cosily
on
a
little
bench
behind
the
schoolhouse
looking
at
a
picture
book
with
alfred
temple
and
so
absorbed
were
they
and
their
heads
so
close
together
over
the
book
that
they
did
not
seem
to
be
conscious
of
anything
in
the
world
besides
jealousy
ran
red
hot
through
tom's
veins
he
began
to
hate
himself
for
throwing
away
the
chance
becky
had
offered
for
a
reconciliation
he
called
himself
a
fool
and
all
the
hard
names
he
could
think
of
he
wanted
to
cry
with
vexation
amy
chatted
happily
along
as
they
walked
for
her
heart
was
singing
but
tom's
tongue
had
lost
its
function
he
did
not
hear
what
amy
was
saying
and
whenever
she
paused
expectantly
he
could
only
stammer
an
awkward
assent
which
was
as
often
misplaced
as
otherwise
he
kept
drifting
to
the
rear
of
the
schoolhouse
again
and
again
to
sear
his
eyeballs
with
the
hateful
spectacle
there
he
could
not
help
it
and
it
maddened
him
to
see
as
he
thought
he
saw
that
becky
thatcher
never
once
suspected
that
he
was
even
in
the
land
of
the
living
but
she
did
see
nevertheless
and
she
knew
she
was
winning
her
fight
too
and
was
glad
to
see
him
suffer
as
she
had
suffered
amy's
happy
prattle
became
intolerable
tom
hinted
at
things
he
had
to
attend
to
things
that
must
be
done
and
time
was
fleeting
but
in
vain
the
girl
chirped
on
tom
thought
oh
hang
her
ain't
i
ever
going
to
get
rid
of
her
at
last
he
must
be
attending
to
those
things
and
she
said
artlessly
that
she
would
be
around
when
school
let
out
and
he
hastened
away
hating
her
for
it
any
other
boy
tom
thought
grating
his
teeth
any
boy
in
the
whole
town
but
that
saint
louis
smarty
that
thinks
he
dresses
so
fine
and
is
aristocracy
oh
all
right
i
licked
you
the
first
day
you
ever
saw
this
town
mister
and
i'll
lick
you
again
you
just
wait
till
i
catch
you
out
i'll
just
take
and
and
he
went
through
the
motions
of
thrashing
an
imaginary
boy
pummelling
the
air
and
kicking
and
gouging
oh
you
do
do
you
you
holler
nough
do
you
now
then
let
that
learn
you
and
so
the
imaginary
flogging
was
finished
to
his
satisfaction
tom
fled
home
at
noon
his
conscience
could
not
endure
any
more
of
amy's
grateful
happiness
and
his
jealousy
could
bear
no
more
of
the
other
distress
becky
resumed
her
picture
inspections
with
alfred
but
as
the
minutes
dragged
along
and
no
tom
came
to
suffer
her
triumph
began
to
cloud
and
she
lost
interest
gravity
and
absentmindedness
followed
and
then
melancholy
two
or
three
times
she
pricked
up
her
ear
at
a
footstep
but
it
was
a
false
hope
no
tom
came
at
last
she
grew
entirely
miserable
and
wished
she
hadn't
carried
it
so
far
when
poor
alfred
seeing
that
he
was
losing
her
he
did
not
know
how
kept
exclaiming
oh
here's
a
jolly
one
look
at
this
she
lost
patience
at
last
and
said
oh
don't
bother
me
i
don't
care
for
them
and
burst
into
tears
and
got
up
and
walked
away
alfred
dropped
alongside
and
was
going
to
try
to
comfort
her
but
she
said
go
away
and
leave
me
alone
can't
you
i
hate
you
so
the
boy
halted
wondering
what
he
could
have
done
for
she
had
said
she
would
look
at
pictures
all
through
the
nooning
and
she
walked
on
crying
then
alfred
went
musing
into
the
deserted
schoolhouse
he
was
humiliated
and
angry
he
easily
guessed
his
way
to
the
truth
the
girl
had
simply
made
a
convenience
of
him
to
vent
her
spite
upon
tom
sawyer
he
was
far
from
hating
tom
the
less
when
this
thought
occurred
to
him
he
wished
there
was
some
way
to
get
that
boy
into
trouble
without
much
risk
to
himself
tom's
spelling
book
fell
under
his
eye
here
was
his
opportunity
he
gratefully
opened
to
the
lesson
for
the
afternoon
and
poured
ink
upon
the
page
becky
glancing
in
at
a
window
behind
him
at
the
moment
saw
the
act
and
moved
on
without
discovering
herself
she
started
homeward
now
intending
to
find
tom
and
tell
him
tom
would
be
thankful
and
their
troubles
would
be
healed
before
she
was
half
way
home
however
she
had
changed
her
mind
the
thought
of
tom's
treatment
of
her
when
she
was
talking
about
her
picnic
came
scorching
back
and
filled
her
with
shame
she
resolved
to
let
him
get
whipped
on
the
damaged
spelling
book's
account
and
to
hate
him
forever
into
the
bargain
chapter
xix
tom
arrived
at
home
in
a
dreary
mood
and
the
first
thing
his
aunt
said
to
him
showed
him
that
he
had
brought
his
sorrows
to
an
unpromising
market
tom
i've
a
notion
to
skin
you
alive
auntie
what
have
i
done
well
you've
done
enough
here
i
go
over
to
sereny
harper
like
an
old
softy
expecting
i'm
going
to
make
her
believe
all
that
rubbage
about
that
dream
when
lo
and
behold
you
she'd
found
out
from
joe
that
you
was
over
here
and
heard
all
the
talk
we
had
that
night
tom
i
don't
know
what
is
to
become
of
a
boy
that
will
act
like
that
it
makes
me
feel
so
bad
to
think
you
could
let
me
go
to
sereny
harper
and
make
such
a
fool
of
myself
and
never
say
a
word
this
was
a
new
aspect
of
the
thing
his
smartness
of
the
morning
had
seemed
to
tom
a
good
joke
before
and
very
ingenious
it
merely
looked
mean
and
shabby
now
he
hung
his
head
and
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
for
a
moment
then
he
said
auntie
i
wish
i
hadn't
done
it
but
i
didn't
think
oh
child
you
never
think
you
never
think
of
anything
but
your
own
selfishness
you
could
think
to
come
all
the
way
over
here
from
jackson's
island
in
the
night
to
laugh
at
our
troubles
and
you
could
think
to
fool
me
with
a
lie
about
a
dream
but
you
couldn't
ever
think
to
pity
us
and
save
us
from
sorrow
auntie
i
know
now
it
was
mean
but
i
didn't
mean
to
be
mean
i
didn't
honest
and
besides
i
didn't
come
over
here
to
laugh
at
you
that
night
what
did
you
come
for
then
it
was
to
tell
you
not
to
be
uneasy
about
us
because
we
hadn't
got
drownded
tom
tom
i
would
be
the
thankfullest
soul
in
this
world
if
i
could
believe
you
ever
had
as
good
a
thought
as
that
but
you
know
you
never
did
and
i
know
it
tom
indeed
and
deed
i
did
auntie
i
wish
i
may
never
stir
if
i
didn't
oh
tom
don't
lie
don't
do
it
it
only
makes
things
a
hundred
times
worse
it
ain't
a
lie
auntie
it's
the
truth
i
wanted
to
keep
you
from
grieving
that
was
all
that
made
me
come
i'd
give
the
whole
world
to
believe
that
it
would
cover
up
a
power
of
sins
tom
i'd
most
be
glad
you'd
run
off
and
acted
so
bad
but
it
ain't
reasonable
because
why
didn't
you
tell
me
child
why
you
see
when
you
got
to
talking
about
the
funeral
i
just
got
all
full
of
the
idea
of
our
coming
and
hiding
in
the
church
and
i
couldn't
somehow
bear
to
spoil
it
so
i
just
put
the
bark
back
in
my
pocket
and
kept
mum
what
bark
the
bark
i
had
wrote
on
to
tell
you
we'd
gone
pirating
i
wish
now
you'd
waked
up
when
i
kissed
you
i
do
honest
the
hard
lines
in
his
aunt's
face
relaxed
and
a
sudden
tenderness
dawned
in
her
eyes
did
you
kiss
me
tom
why
yes
i
did
are
you
sure
you
did
tom
why
yes
i
did
auntie
certain
sure
what
did
you
kiss
me
for
tom
because
i
loved
you
so
and
you
laid
there
moaning
and
i
was
so
sorry
the
words
sounded
like
truth
the
old
lady
could
not
hide
a
tremor
in
her
voice
when
she
said
kiss
me
again
tom
and
be
off
with
you
to
school
now
and
don't
bother
me
any
more
the
moment
he
was
gone
she
ran
to
a
closet
and
got
out
the
ruin
of
a
jacket
which
tom
had
gone
pirating
in
then
she
stopped
with
it
in
her
hand
and
said
to
herself
no
i
don't
dare
poor
boy
i
reckon
he's
lied
about
it
but
it's
a
blessed
blessed
lie
there's
such
a
comfort
come
from
it
i
hope
the
lord
i
know
the
lord
will
forgive
him
because
it
was
such
good
heartedness
in
him
to
tell
it
but
i
don't
want
to
find
out
it's
a
lie
i
won't
look
she
put
the
jacket
away
and
stood
by
musing
a
minute
twice
she
put
out
her
hand
to
take
the
garment
again
and
twice
she
refrained
once
more
she
ventured
and
this
time
she
fortified
herself
with
the
thought
it's
a
good
lie
it's
a
good
lie
i
won't
let
it
grieve
me
so
she
sought
the
jacket
pocket
a
moment
later
she
was
reading
tom's
piece
of
bark
through
flowing
tears
and
saying
i
could
forgive
the
boy
now
if
he'd
committed
a
million
sins
chapter
xx
there
was
something
about
aunt
polly's
manner
when
she
kissed
tom
that
swept
away
his
low
spirits
and
made
him
lighthearted
and
happy
again
he
started
to
school
and
had
the
luck
of
coming
upon
becky
thatcher
at
the
head
of
meadow
lane
his
mood
always
determined
his
manner
without
a
moment's
hesitation
he
ran
to
her
and
said
i
acted
mighty
mean
today
becky
and
i'm
so
sorry
i
won't
ever
ever
do
that
way
again
as
long
as
ever
i
live
please
make
up
won't
you
the
girl
stopped
and
looked
him
scornfully
in
the
face
i'll
thank
you
to
keep
yourself
to
yourself
mr
thomas
sawyer
i'll
never
speak
to
you
again
she
tossed
her
head
and
passed
on
tom
was
so
stunned
that
he
had
not
even
presence
of
mind
enough
to
say
who
cares
miss
smarty
until
the
right
time
to
say
it
had
gone
by
so
he
said
nothing
but
he
was
in
a
fine
rage
nevertheless
he
moped
into
the
schoolyard
wishing
she
were
a
boy
and
imagining
how
he
would
trounce
her
if
she
were
he
presently
encountered
her
and
delivered
a
stinging
remark
as
he
passed
she
hurled
one
in
return
and
the
angry
breach
was
complete
it
seemed
to
becky
in
her
hot
resentment
that
she
could
hardly
wait
for
school
to
take
in
she
was
so
impatient
to
see
tom
flogged
for
the
injured
spelling
book
if
she
had
had
any
lingering
notion
of
exposing
alfred
temple
tom's
offensive
fling
had
driven
it
entirely
away
poor
girl
she
did
not
know
how
fast
she
was
nearing
trouble
herself
the
master
mr
dobbins
had
reached
middle
age
with
an
unsatisfied
ambition
the
darling
of
his
desires
was
to
be
a
doctor
but
poverty
had
decreed
that
he
should
be
nothing
higher
than
a
village
schoolmaster
every
day
he
took
a
mysterious
book
out
of
his
desk
and
absorbed
himself
in
it
at
times
when
no
classes
were
reciting
he
kept
that
book
under
lock
and
key
there
was
not
an
urchin
in
school
but
was
perishing
to
have
a
glimpse
of
it
but
the
chance
never
came
every
boy
and
girl
had
a
theory
about
the
nature
of
that
book
but
no
two
theories
were
alike
and
there
was
no
way
of
getting
at
the
facts
in
the
case
now
as
becky
was
passing
by
the
desk
which
stood
near
the
door
she
noticed
that
the
key
was
in
the
lock
it
was
a
precious
moment
she
glanced
around
found
herself
alone
and
the
next
instant
she
had
the
book
in
her
hands
the
titlepage
professor
somebody's
anatomy
carried
no
information
to
her
mind
so
she
began
to
turn
the
leaves
she
came
at
once
upon
a
handsomely
engraved
and
colored
frontispiece
a
human
figure
stark
naked
at
that
moment
a
shadow
fell
on
the
page
and
tom
sawyer
stepped
in
at
the
door
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
picture
becky
snatched
at
the
book
to
close
it
and
had
the
hard
luck
to
tear
the
pictured
page
half
down
the
middle
she
thrust
the
volume
into
the
desk
turned
the
key
and
burst
out
crying
with
shame
and
vexation
tom
sawyer
you
are
just
as
mean
as
you
can
be
to
sneak
up
on
a
person
and
look
at
what
they're
looking
at
how
could
i
know
you
was
looking
at
anything
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
tom
sawyer
you
know
you're
going
to
tell
on
me
and
oh
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
i'll
be
whipped
and
i
never
was
whipped
in
school
then
she
stamped
her
little
foot
and
said
be
so
mean
if
you
want
to
i
know
something
that's
going
to
happen
you
just
wait
and
you'll
see
hateful
hateful
hateful
and
she
flung
out
of
the
house
with
a
new
explosion
of
crying
tom
stood
still
rather
flustered
by
this
onslaught
presently
he
said
to
himself
what
a
curious
kind
of
a
fool
a
girl
is
never
been
licked
in
school
shucks
what's
a
licking
that's
just
like
a
girl
they're
so
thin
skinned
and
chicken
hearted
well
of
course
i
ain't
going
to
tell
old
dobbins
on
this
little
fool
because
there's
other
ways
of
getting
even
on
her
that
ain't
so
mean
but
what
of
it
old
dobbins
will
ask
who
it
was
tore
his
book
nobody'll
answer
then
he'll
do
just
the
way
he
always
does
ask
first
one
and
then
t'other
and
when
he
comes
to
the
right
girl
he'll
know
it
without
any
telling
girls
faces
always
tell
on
them
they
ain't
got
any
backbone
she'll
get
licked
well
it's
a
kind
of
a
tight
place
for
becky
thatcher
because
there
ain't
any
way
out
of
it
tom
conned
the
thing
a
moment
longer
and
then
added
all
right
though
she'd
like
to
see
me
in
just
such
a
fix
let
her
sweat
it
out
tom
joined
the
mob
of
skylarking
scholars
outside
in
a
few
moments
the
master
arrived
and
school
took
in
tom
did
not
feel
a
strong
interest
in
his
studies
every
time
he
stole
a
glance
at
the
girls
side
of
the
room
becky's
face
troubled
him
considering
all
things
he
did
not
want
to
pity
her
and
yet
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
help
it
he
could
get
up
no
exultation
that
was
really
worthy
the
name
presently
the
spelling
book
discovery
was
made
and
tom's
mind
was
entirely
full
of
his
own
matters
for
a
while
after
that
becky
roused
up
from
her
lethargy
of
distress
and
showed
good
interest
in
the
proceedings
she
did
not
expect
that
tom
could
get
out
of
his
trouble
by
denying
that
he
spilt
the
ink
on
the
book
himself
and
she
was
right
the
denial
only
seemed
to
make
the
thing
worse
for
tom
becky
supposed
she
would
be
glad
of
that
and
she
tried
to
believe
she
was
glad
of
it
but
she
found
she
was
not
certain
when
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
she
had
an
impulse
to
get
up
and
tell
on
alfred
temple
but
she
made
an
effort
and
forced
herself
to
keep
still
because
said
she
to
herself
he'll
tell
about
me
tearing
the
picture
sure
i
wouldn't
say
a
word
not
to
save
his
life
tom
took
his
whipping
and
went
back
to
his
seat
not
at
all
broken
hearted
for
he
thought
it
was
possible
that
he
had
unknowingly
upset
the
ink
on
the
spelling
book
himself
in
some
skylarking
bout
he
had
denied
it
for
form's
sake
and
because
it
was
custom
and
had
stuck
to
the
denial
from
principle
a
whole
hour
drifted
by
the
master
sat
nodding
in
his
throne
the
air
was
drowsy
with
the
hum
of
study
by
and
by
mr
dobbins
straightened
himself
up
yawned
then
unlocked
his
desk
and
reached
for
his
book
but
seemed
undecided
whether
to
take
it
out
or
leave
it
most
of
the
pupils
glanced
up
languidly
but
there
were
two
among
them
that
watched
his
movements
with
intent
eyes
mr
dobbins
fingered
his
book
absently
for
a
while
then
took
it
out
and
settled
himself
in
his
chair
to
read
tom
shot
a
glance
at
becky
he
had
seen
a
hunted
and
helpless
rabbit
look
as
she
did
with
a
gun
levelled
at
its
head
instantly
he
forgot
his
quarrel
with
her
quick
something
must
be
done
done
in
a
flash
too
but
the
very
imminence
of
the
emergency
paralyzed
his
invention
good
he
had
an
inspiration
he
would
run
and
snatch
the
book
spring
through
the
door
and
fly
but
his
resolution
shook
for
one
little
instant
and
the
chance
was
lost
the
master
opened
the
volume
if
tom
only
had
the
wasted
opportunity
back
again
too
late
there
was
no
help
for
becky
now
he
said
the
next
moment
the
master
faced
the
school
every
eye
sank
under
his
gaze
there
was
that
in
it
which
smote
even
the
innocent
with
fear
there
was
silence
while
one
might
count
ten
the
master
was
gathering
his
wrath
then
he
spoke
who
tore
this
book
there
was
not
a
sound
one
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
the
stillness
continued
the
master
searched
face
after
face
for
signs
of
guilt

tom's
uneasiness
grew
more
and
more
intense
under
the
slow
torture
of
these
proceedings
the
master
scanned
the
ranks
of
boys
considered
a
while

to

was
trembling
from
head
to

with
excitement
and
a
sense
of
the
hopelessness
of
the
situation
rebecca

glanced
at
her
face

was
white
with

you

in

face

this
book
a
thought
shot
like
lightning
through
tom's
brain
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
shouted
i
done
it
the
school
stared
in
perplexity
at
this
incredible
folly
tom
stood
a
moment
to
gather
his
dismembered
faculties
and
when
he
stepped
forward
to
go
to
his
punishment
the
surprise
the
gratitude
the
adoration
that
shone
upon
him
out
of
poor
becky's
eyes
seemed
pay
enough
for
a
hundred
floggings
inspired
by
the
splendor
of
his
own
act
he
took
without
an
outcry
the
most
merciless
flaying
that
even
mr
dobbins
had
ever
administered
and
also
received
with
indifference
the
added
cruelty
of
a
command
to
remain
two
hours
after
school
should
be
dismissed
for
he
knew
who
would
wait
for
him
outside
till
his
captivity
was
done
and
not
count
the
tedious
time
as
loss
either
tom
went
to
bed
that
night
planning
vengeance
against
alfred
temple
for
with
shame
and
repentance
becky
had
told
him
all
not
forgetting
her
own
treachery
but
even
the
longing
for
vengeance
had
to
give
way
soon
to
pleasanter
musings
and
he
fell
asleep
at
last
with
becky's
latest
words
lingering
dreamily
in
his
ear
tom
how
could
you
be
so
noble
chapter
xxi
vacation
was
approaching
the
schoolmaster
always
severe
grew
severer
and
more
exacting
than
ever
for
he
wanted
the
school
to
make
a
good
showing
on
examination
day
his
rod
and
his
ferule
were
seldom
idle
now
at
least
among
the
smaller
pupils
only
the
biggest
boys
and
young
ladies
of
eighteen
and
twenty
escaped
lashing
mr
dobbins
lashings
were
very
vigorous
ones
too
for
although
he
carried
under
his
wig
a
perfectly
bald
and
shiny
head
he
had
only
reached
middle
age
and
there
was
no
sign
of
feebleness
in
his
muscle
as
the
great
day
approached
all
the
tyranny
that
was
in
him
came
to
the
surface
he
seemed
to
take
a
vindictive
pleasure
in
punishing
the
least
shortcomings
the
consequence
was
that
the
smaller
boys
spent
their
days
in
terror
and
suffering
and
their
nights
in
plotting
revenge
they
threw
away
no
opportunity
to
do
the
master
a
mischief
but
he
kept
ahead
all
the
time
the
retribution
that
followed
every
vengeful
success
was
so
sweeping
and
majestic
that
the
boys
always
retired
from
the
field
badly
worsted
at
last
they
conspired
together
and
hit
upon
a
plan
that
promised
a
dazzling
victory
they
swore
in
the
signpainter's
boy
told
him
the
scheme
and
asked
his
help
he
had
his
own
reasons
for
being
delighted
for
the
master
boarded
in
his
father's
family
and
had
given
the
boy
ample
cause
to
hate
him
the
master's
wife
would
go
on
a
visit
to
the
country
in
a
few
days
and
there
would
be
nothing
to
interfere
with
the
plan
the
master
always
prepared
himself
for
great
occasions
by
getting
pretty
well
fuddled
and
the
signpainter's
boy
said
that
when
the
dominie
had
reached
the
proper
condition
on
examination
evening
he
would
manage
the
thing
while
he
napped
in
his
chair
then
he
would
have
him
awakened
at
the
right
time
and
hurried
away
to
school
in
the
fulness
of
time
the
interesting
occasion
arrived
at
eight
in
the
evening
the
schoolhouse
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
adorned
with
wreaths
and
festoons
of
foliage
and
flowers
the
master
sat
throned
in
his
great
chair
upon
a
raised
platform
with
his
blackboard
behind
him
he
was
looking
tolerably
mellow
three
rows
of
benches
on
each
side
and
six
rows
in
front
of
him
were
occupied
by
the
dignitaries
of
the
town
and
by
the
parents
of
the
pupils
to
his
left
back
of
the
rows
of
citizens
was
a
spacious
temporary
platform
upon
which
were
seated
the
scholars
who
were
to
take
part
in
the
exercises
of
the
evening
rows
of
small
boys
washed
and
dressed
to
an
intolerable
state
of
discomfort
rows
of
gawky
big
boys
snowbanks
of
girls
and
young
ladies
clad
in
lawn
and
muslin
and
conspicuously
conscious
of
their
bare
arms
their
grandmothers
ancient
trinkets
their
bits
of
pink
and
blue
ribbon
and
the
flowers
in
their
hair
all
the
rest
of
the
house
was
filled
with
non
participating
scholars
the
exercises
began
a
very
little
boy
stood
up
and
sheepishly
recited
you'd
scarce
expect
one
of
my
age
to
speak
in
public
on
the
stage
etc
accompanying
himself
with
the
painfully
exact
and
spasmodic
gestures
which
a
machine
might
have
used
supposing
the
machine
to
be
a
trifle
out
of
order
but
he
got
through
safely
though
cruelly
scared
and
got
a
fine
round
of
applause
when
he
made
his
manufactured
bow
and
retired
a
little
shamefaced
girl
lisped
mary
had
a
little
lamb
etc
performed
a
compassion
inspiring
curtsy
got
her
meed
of
applause
and
sat
down
flushed
and
happy
tom
sawyer
stepped
forward
with
conceited
confidence
and
soared
into
the
unquenchable
and
indestructible
give
me
liberty
or
give
me
death
speech
with
fine
fury
and
frantic
gesticulation
and
broke
down
in
the
middle
of
it
a
ghastly
stage
fright
seized
him
his
legs
quaked
under
him
and
he
was
like
to
choke
true
he
had
the
manifest
sympathy
of
the
house
but
he
had
the
house's
silence
too
which
was
even
worse
than
its
sympathy
the
master
frowned
and
this
completed
the
disaster
tom
struggled
awhile
and
then
retired
utterly
defeated
there
was
a
weak
attempt
at
applause
but
it
died
early
the
boy
stood
on
the
burning
deck
followed
also
the
assyrian
came
down
and
other
declamatory
gems
then
there
were
reading
exercises
and
a
spelling
fight
the
meagre
latin
class
recited
with
honor
the
prime
feature
of
the
evening
was
in
order
now
original
compositions
by
the
young
ladies
each
in
her
turn
stepped
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
cleared
her
throat
held
up
her
manuscript
tied
with
dainty
ribbon
and
proceeded
to
read
with
labored
attention
to
expression
and
punctuation
the
themes
were
the
same
that
had
been
illuminated
upon
similar
occasions
by
their
mothers
before
them
their
grandmothers
and
doubtless
all
their
ancestors
in
the
female
line
clear
back
to
the
crusades
friendship
was
one
memories
of
other
days
religion
in
history
dream
land
the
advantages
of
culture
forms
of
political
government
compared
and
contrasted
melancholy
filial
love
heart
longings
etc
etc
a
prevalent
feature
in
these
compositions
was
a
nursed
and
petted
melancholy
another
was
a
wasteful
and
opulent
gush
of
fine
language
another
was
a
tendency
to
lug
in
by
the
ears
particularly
prized
words
and
phrases
until
they
were
worn
entirely
out
and
a
peculiarity
that
conspicuously
marked
and
marred
them
was
the
inveterate
and
intolerable
sermon
that
wagged
its
crippled
tail
at
the
end
of
each
and
every
one
of
them
no
matter
what
the
subject
might
be
a
brainracking
effort
was
made
to
squirm
it
into
some
aspect
or
other
that
the
moral
and
religious
mind
could
contemplate
with
edification
the
glaring
insincerity
of
these
sermons
was
not
sufficient
to
compass
the
banishment
of
the
fashion
from
the
schools
and
it
is
not
sufficient
today
it
never
will
be
sufficient
while
the
world
stands
perhaps
there
is
no
school
in
all
our
land
where
the
young
ladies
do
not
feel
obliged
to
close
their
compositions
with
a
sermon
and
you
will
find
that
the
sermon
of
the
most
frivolous
and
the
least
religious
girl
in
the
school
is
always
the
longest
and
the
most
relentlessly
pious
but
enough
of
this
homely
truth
is
unpalatable
let
us
return
to
the
examination
the
first
composition
that
was
read
was
one
entitled
is
this
then
life
perhaps
the
reader
can
endure
an
extract
from
it
in
the
common
walks
of
life
with
what
delightful
emotions
does
the
youthful
mind
look
forward
to
some
anticipated
scene
of
festivity
imagination
is
busy
sketching
rose
tinted
pictures
of
joy
in
fancy
the
voluptuous
votary
of
fashion
sees
herself
amid
the
festive
throng
the
observed
of
all
observers
her
graceful
form
arrayed
in
snowy
robes
is
whirling
through
the
mazes
of
the
joyous
dance
her
eye
is
brightest
her
step
is
lightest
in
the
gay
assembly
in
such
delicious
fancies
time
quickly
glides
by
and
the
welcome
hour
arrives
for
her
entrance
into
the
elysian
world
of
which
she
has
had
such
bright
dreams
how
fairy
like
does
everything
appear
to
her
enchanted
vision
each
new
scene
is
more
charming
than
the
last
but
after
a
while
she
finds
that
beneath
this
goodly
exterior
all
is
vanity
the
flattery
which
once
charmed
her
soul
now
grates
harshly
upon
her
ear
the
ballroom
has
lost
its
charms
and
with
wasted
health
and
imbittered
heart
she
turns
away
with
the
conviction
that
earthly
pleasures
cannot
satisfy
the
longings
of
the
soul
and
so
forth
and
so
on
there
was
a
buzz
of
gratification
from
time
to
time
during
the
reading
accompanied
by
whispered
ejaculations
of
how
sweet
how
eloquent
so
true
etc
and
after
the
thing
had
closed
with
a
peculiarly
afflicting
sermon
the
applause
was
enthusiastic
then
arose
a
slim
melancholy
girl
whose
face
had
the
interesting
paleness
that
comes
of
pills
and
indigestion
and
read
a
poem
two
stanzas
of
it
will
do
a
missouri
maiden's
farewell
to
alabama
alabama
goodbye
i
love
thee
well
but
yet
for
a
while
do
i
leave
thee
now
sad
yes
sad
thoughts
of
thee
my
heart
doth
swell
and
burning
recollections
throng
my
brow
for
i
have
wandered
through
thy
flowery
woods
have
roamed
and
read
near
tallapoosa's
stream
have
listened
to
tallassee's
warring
floods
and
wooed
on
coosa's
side
aurora's
beam
yet
shame
i
not
to
bear
an
o'erfull
heart
nor
blush
to
turn
behind
my
tearful
eyes
tis
from
no
stranger
land
i
now
must
part
tis
to
no
strangers
left
i
yield
these
sighs
welcome
and
home
were
mine
within
this
state
whose
vales
i
leave
whose
spires
fade
fast
from
me
and
cold
must
be
mine
eyes
and
heart
and
tete
when
dear
alabama
they
turn
cold
on
thee
there
were
very
few
there
who
knew
what
tete
meant
but
the
poem
was
very
satisfactory
nevertheless
next
appeared
a
dark
complexioned
black
eyed
black
haired
young
lady
who
paused
an
impressive
moment
assumed
a
tragic
expression
and
began
to
read
in
a
measured
solemn
tone
a
vision
dark
and
tempestuous
was
night
around
the
throne
on
high
not
a
single
star
quivered
but
the
deep
intonations
of
the
heavy
thunder
constantly
vibrated
upon
the
ear
whilst
the
terrific
lightning
revelled
in
angry
mood
through
the
cloudy
chambers
of
heaven
seeming
to
scorn
the
power
exerted
over
its
terror
by
the
illustrious
franklin
even
the
boisterous
winds
unanimously
came
forth
from
their
mystic
homes
and
blustered
about
as
if
to
enhance
by
their
aid
the
wildness
of
the
scene
at
such
a
time
so
dark
so
dreary
for
human
sympathy
my
very
spirit
sighed
but
instead
thereof
my
dearest
friend
my
counsellor
my
comforter
and
guide
my
joy
in
grief
my
second
bliss
in
joy
came
to
my
side
she
moved
like
one
of
those
bright
beings
pictured
in
the
sunny
walks
of
fancy's
eden
by
the
romantic
and
young
a
queen
of
beauty
unadorned
save
by
her
own
transcendent
loveliness
so
soft
was
her
step
it
failed
to
make
even
a
sound
and
but
for
the
magical
thrill
imparted
by
her
genial
touch
as
other
unobtrusive
beauties
she
would
have
glided
away
unperceived
unsought
a
strange
sadness
rested
upon
her
features
like
icy
tears
upon
the
robe
of
december
as
she
pointed
to
the
contending
elements
without
and
bade
me
contemplate
the
two
beings
presented
this
nightmare
occupied
some
ten
pages
of
manuscript
and
wound
up
with
a
sermon
so
destructive
of
all
hope
to
non
presbyterians
that
it
took
the
first
prize
this
composition
was
considered
to
be
the
very
finest
effort
of
the
evening
the
mayor
of
the
village
in
delivering
the
prize
to
the
author
of
it
made
a
warm
speech
in
which
he
said
that
it
was
by
far
the
most
eloquent
thing
he
had
ever
listened
to
and
that
daniel
webster
himself
might
well
be
proud
of
it
it
may
be
remarked
in
passing
that
the
number
of
compositions
in
which
the
word
beauteous
was
over
fondled
and
human
experience
referred
to
as
life's
page
was
up
to
the
usual
average
now
the
master
mellow
almost
to
the
verge
of
geniality
put
his
chair
aside
turned
his
back
to
the
audience
and
began
to
draw
a
map
of
america
on
the
blackboard
to
exercise
the
geography
class
upon
but
he
made
a
sad
business
of
it
with
his
unsteady
hand
and
a
smothered
titter
rippled
over
the
house
he
knew
what
the
matter
was
and
set
himself
to
right
it
he
sponged
out
lines
and
remade
them
but
he
only
distorted
them
more
than
ever
and
the
tittering
was
more
pronounced
he
threw
his
entire
attention
upon
his
work
now
as
if
determined
not
to
be
put
down
by
the
mirth
he
felt
that
all
eyes
were
fastened
upon
him
he
imagined
he
was
succeeding
and
yet
the
tittering
continued
it
even
manifestly
increased
and
well
it
might
there
was
a
garret
above
pierced
with
a
scuttle
over
his
head
and
down
through
this
scuttle
came
a
cat
suspended
around
the
haunches
by
a
string
she
had
a
rag
tied
about
her
head
and
jaws
to
keep
her
from
mewing
as
she
slowly
descended
she
curved
upward
and
clawed
at
the
string
she
swung
downward
and
clawed
at
the
intangible
air
the
tittering
rose
higher
and
higher
the
cat
was
within
six
inches
of
the
absorbed
teacher's
head
down
down
a
little
lower
and
she
grabbed
his
wig
with
her
desperate
claws
clung
to
it
and
was
snatched
up
into
the
garret
in
an
instant
with
her
trophy
still
in
her
possession
and
how
the
light
did
blaze
abroad
from
the
master's
bald
pate
for
the
signpainter's
boy
had
gilded
it
that
broke
up
the
meeting
the
boys
were
avenged
vacation

come
note
the
pretended
compositions
quoted
in
this
chapter
are
taken
without
alteration
from
a
volume
entitled
prose
and
poetry
by
a
western
lady
but
they
are
exactly
and
precisely
after
the
schoolgirl
pattern
and
hence
are
much
happier
than
any
mere
imitations
could
be
chapter
xxii
tom
joined
the
new
order
of
cadets
of
temperance
being
attracted
by
the
showy
character
of
their
regalia
he
promised
to
abstain
from
smoking
chewing
and
profanity
as
long
as
he
remained
a
member
now
he
found
out
a
new
thing
namely
that
to
promise
not
to
do
a
thing
is
the
surest
way
in
the
world
to
make
a
body
want
to
go
and
do
that
very
thing
tom
soon
found
himself
tormented
with
a
desire
to
drink
and
swear
the
desire
grew
to
be
so
intense
that
nothing
but
the
hope
of
a
chance
to
display
himself
in
his
red
sash
kept
him
from
withdrawing
from
the
order
fourth
of
july
was
coming
but
he
soon
gave
that
up
gave
it
up
before
he
had
worn
his
shackles
over
forty
eight
hours
and
fixed
his
hopes
upon
old
judge
frazer
justice
of
the
peace
who
was
apparently
on
his
deathbed
and
would
have
a
big
public
funeral
since
he
was
so
high
an
official
during
three
days
tom
was
deeply
concerned
about
the
judge's
condition
and
hungry
for
news
of
it
sometimes
his
hopes
ran
high
so
high
that
he
would
venture
to
get
out
his
regalia
and
practise
before
the
looking
glass
but
the
judge
had
a
most
discouraging
way
of
fluctuating
at
last
he
was
pronounced
upon
the
mend
and
then
convalescent
tom
was
disgusted
and
felt
a
sense
of
injury
too
he
handed
in
his
resignation
at
once
and
that
night
the
judge
suffered
a
relapse
and
died
tom
resolved
that
he
would
never
trust
a
man
like
that
again
the
funeral
was
a
fine
thing
the
cadets
paraded
in
a
style
calculated
to
kill
the
late
member
with
envy
tom
was
a
free
boy
again
however
there
was
something
in
that
he
could
drink
and
swear
now
but
found
to
his
surprise
that
he
did
not
want
to
the
simple
fact
that
he
could
took
the
desire
away
and
the
charm
of
it
tom
presently
wondered
to
find
that
his
coveted
vacation
was
beginning
to
hang
a
little
heavily
on
his
hands
he
attempted
a
diary
but
nothing
happened
during
three
days
and
so
he
abandoned
it
the
first
of
all
the
negro
minstrel
shows
came
to
town
and
made
a
sensation
tom
and
joe
harper
got
up
a
band
of
performers
and
were
happy
for
two
days
even
the
glorious
fourth
was
in
some
sense
a
failure
for
it
rained
hard
there
was
no
procession
in
consequence
and
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
as
tom
supposed
mr
benton
an
actual
united
states
senator
proved
an
overwhelming
disappointment
for
he
was
not
twenty
five
feet
high
nor
even
anywhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
it
a
circus
came
the
boys
played
circus
for
three
days
afterward
in
tents
made
of
rag
carpeting
admission
three
pins
for
boys
two
for
girls
and
then
circusing
was
abandoned
a
phrenologist
and
a
mesmerizer
came
and
went
again
and
left
the
village
duller
and
drearier
than
ever
there
were
some
boys
and
girls
parties
but
they
were
so
few
and
so
delightful
that
they
only
made
the
aching
voids
between
ache
the
harder
becky
thatcher
was
gone
to
her
constantinople
home
to
stay
with
her
parents
during
vacation
so
there
was
no
bright
side
to
life
anywhere
the
dreadful
secret
of
the
murder
was
a
chronic
misery
it
was
a
very
cancer
for
permanency
and
pain
then
came
the
measles
during
two
long
weeks
tom
lay
a
prisoner
dead
to
the
world
and
its
happenings
he
was
very
ill
he
was
interested
in
nothing
when
he
got
upon
his
feet
at
last
and
moved
feebly
downtown
a
melancholy
change
had
come
over
everything
and
every
creature
there
had
been
a
revival
and
everybody
had
got
religion
not
only
the
adults
but
even
the
boys
and
girls
tom
went
about
hoping
against
hope
for
the
sight
of
one
blessed
sinful
face
but
disappointment
crossed
him
everywhere
he
found
joe
harper
studying
a
testament
and
turned
sadly
away
from
the
depressing
spectacle
he
sought
ben
rogers
and
found
him
visiting
the
poor
with
a
basket
of
tracts
he
hunted
up
jim
hollis
who
called
his
attention
to
the
precious
blessing
of
his
late
measles
as
a
warning
every
boy
he
encountered
added
another
ton
to
his
depression
and
when
in
desperation
he
flew
for
refuge
at
last
to
the
bosom
of
huckleberry
finn
and
was
received
with
a
scriptural
quotation
his
heart
broke
and
he
crept
home
and
to
bed
realizing
that
he
alone
of
all
the
town
was
lost
forever
and
forever
and
that
night
there
came
on
a
terrific
storm
with
driving
rain
awful
claps
of
thunder
and
blinding
sheets
of
lightning
he
covered
his
head
with
the
bedclothes
and
waited
in
a
horror
of
suspense
for
his
doom
for
he
had
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
all
this
hubbub
was
about
him
he
believed
he
had
taxed
the
forbearance
of
the
powers
above
to
the
extremity
of
endurance
and
that
this
was
the
result
it
might
have
seemed
to
him
a
waste
of
pomp
and
ammunition
to
kill
a
bug
with
a
battery
of
artillery
but
there
seemed
nothing
incongruous
about
the
getting
up
such
an
expensive
thunderstorm
as
this
to
knock
the
turf
from
under
an
insect
like
himself
by
and
by
the
tempest
spent
itself
and
died
without
accomplishing
its
object
the
boy's
first
impulse
was
to
be
grateful
and
reform
his
second
was
to
wait
for
there
might
not
be
any
more
storms
the
next
day
the
doctors
were
back
tom
had
relapsed
the
three
weeks
he
spent
on
his
back
this
time
seemed
an
entire
age
when
he
got
abroad
at
last
he
was
hardly
grateful
that
he
had
been
spared
remembering
how
lonely
was
his
estate
how
companionless
and
forlorn
he
was
he
drifted
listlessly
down
the
street
and
found
jim
hollis
acting
as
judge
in
a
juvenile
court
that
was
trying
a
cat
for
murder
in
the
presence
of
her
victim
a
bird
he
found
joe
harper
and
huck
finn
up
an
alley
eating
a
stolen
melon
poor
lads
they
like
tom
had
suffered
a
relapse
chapter
xxiii
at
last
the
sleepy
atmosphere
was
stirred
and
vigorously
the
murder
trial
came
on
in
the
court
it
became
the
absorbing
topic
of
village
talk
immediately
tom
could
not
get
away
from
it
every
reference
to
the
murder
sent
a
shudder
to
his
heart
for
his
troubled
conscience
and
fears
almost
persuaded
him
that
these
remarks
were
put
forth
in
his
hearing
as
feelers
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
be
suspected
of
knowing
anything
about
the
murder
but
still
he
could
not
be
comfortable
in
the
midst
of
this
gossip
it
kept
him
in
a
cold
shiver
all
the
time
he
took
huck
to
a
lonely
place
to
have
a
talk
with
him
it
would
be
some
relief
to
unseal
his
tongue
for
a
little
while
to
divide
his
burden
of
distress
with
another
sufferer
moreover
he
wanted
to
assure
himself
that
huck
had
remained
discreet
huck
have
you
ever
told
anybody
about
that
bout
what
you
know
what
oh
course
i
haven't
never
a
word
never
a
solitary
word
so
help
me
what
makes
you
ask
well
i
was
afeard
why
tom
sawyer
we
wouldn't
be
alive
two
days
if
that
got
found
out
you
know
that
tom
felt
more
comfortable
after
a
pause
huck
they
couldn't
anybody
get
you
to
tell
could
they
get
me
to
tell
why
if
i
wanted
that
halfbreed
devil
to
drownd
me
they
could
get
me
to
tell
they
ain't
no
different
way
well
that's
all
right
then
i
reckon
we're
safe
as
long
as
we
keep
mum
but
let's
swear
again
anyway
it's
more
surer
i'm
agreed
so
they
swore
again
with
dread
solemnities
what
is
the
talk
around
huck
i've
heard
a
power
of
it
talk
well
it's
just
muff
potter
muff
potter
muff
potter
all
the
time
it
keeps
me
in
a
sweat
constant
so's
i
want
to
hide
som'ers
that's
just
the
same
way
they
go
on
round
me
i
reckon
he's
a
goner
don't
you
feel
sorry
for
him
sometimes
most
always
most
always
he
ain't
no
account
but
then
he
hain't
ever
done
anything
to
hurt
anybody
just
fishes
a
little
to
get
money
to
get
drunk
on
and
loafs
around
considerable
but
lord
we
all
do
that
leastways
most
of
us
preachers
and
such
like
but
he's
kind
of
good
he
give
me
half
a
fish
once
when
there
warn't
enough
for
two
and
lots
of
times
he's
kind
of
stood
by
me
when
i
was
out
of
luck
well
he's
mended
kites
for
me
huck
and
knitted
hooks
on
to
my
line
i
wish
we
could
get
him
out
of
there
my
we
couldn't
get
him
out
tom
and
besides
twouldn't
do
any
good
they'd
ketch
him
again
yes
so
they
would
but
i
hate
to
hear
em
abuse
him
so
like
the
dickens
when
he
never
done
that
i
do
too
tom
lord
i
hear
em
say
he's
the
bloodiest
looking
villain
in
this
country
and
they
wonder
he
wasn't
ever
hung
before
yes
they
talk
like
that
all
the
time
i've
heard
em
say
that
if
he
was
to
get
free
they'd
lynch
him
and
they'd
do
it
too
the
boys
had
a
long
talk
but
it
brought
them
little
comfort
as
the
twilight
drew
on
they
found
themselves
hanging
about
the
neighborhood
of
the
little
isolated
jail
perhaps
with
an
undefined
hope
that
something
would
happen
that
might
clear
away
their
difficulties
but
nothing
happened
there
seemed
to
be
no
angels
or
fairies
interested
in
this
luckless
captive
the
boys
did
as
they
had
often
done
before
went
to
the
cell
grating
and
gave
potter
some
tobacco
and
matches
he
was
on
the
ground
floor
and
there
were
no
guards
his
gratitude
for
their
gifts
had
always
smote
their
consciences
before
it
cut
deeper
than
ever
this
time
they
felt
cowardly
and
treacherous
to
the
last
degree
when
potter
said
you've
been
mighty
good
to
me
boys
better'n
anybody
else
in
this
town
and
i
don't
forget
it
i
don't
often
i
says
to
myself
says
i
i
used
to
mend
all
the
boys
kites
and
things
and
show
em
where
the
good
fishin
places
was
and
befriend
em
what
i
could
and
now
they've
all
forgot
old
muff
when
he's
in
trouble
but
tom
don't
and
huck
don't
they
don't
forget
him
says
i
and
i
don't
forget
them
well
boys
i
done
an
awful
thing
drunk
and
crazy
at
the
time
that's
the
only
way
i
account
for
it
and
now
i
got
to
swing
for
it
and
it's
right
right
and
best
too
i
reckon
hope
so
anyway
well
we
won't
talk
about
that
i
don't
want
to
make
you
feel
bad
you've
befriended
me
but
what
i
want
to
say
is
don't
you
ever
get
drunk
then
you
won't
ever
get
here
stand
a
litter
furder
west
so
that's
it
it's
a
prime
comfort
to
see
faces
that's
friendly
when
a
body's
in
such
a
muck
of
trouble
and
there
don't
none
come
here
but
yourn
good
friendly
faces
good
friendly
faces
git
up
on
one
another's
backs
and
let
me
touch
em
that's
it
shake
hands
yourn'll
come
through
the
bars
but
mine's
too
big
little
hands
and
weak
but
they've
helped
muff
potter
a
power
and
they'd
help
him
more
if
they
could
tom
went
home
miserable
and
his
dreams
that
night
were
full
of
horrors
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
he
hung
about
the
courtroom
drawn
by
an
almost
irresistible
impulse
to
go
in
but
forcing
himself
to
stay
out
huck
was
having
the
same
experience
they
studiously
avoided
each
other
each
wandered
away
from
time
to
time
but
the
same
dismal
fascination
always
brought
them
back
presently
tom
kept
his
ears
open
when
idlers
sauntered
out
of
the
courtroom
but
invariably
heard
distressing
news
the
toils
were
closing
more
and
more
relentlessly
around
poor
potter
at
the
end
of
the
second
day
the
village
talk
was
to
the
effect
that
injun
joe's
evidence
stood
firm
and
unshaken
and
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
question
as
to
what
the
jury's
verdict
would
be
tom
was
out
late
that
night
and
came
to
bed
through
the
window
he
was
in
a
tremendous
state
of
excitement
it
was
hours
before
he
got
to
sleep
all
the
village
flocked
to
the
courthouse
the
next
morning
for
this
was
to
be
the
great
day
both
sexes
were
about
equally
represented
in
the
packed
audience
after
a
long
wait
the
jury
filed
in
and
took
their
places
shortly
afterward
potter
pale
and
haggard
timid
and
hopeless
was
brought
in
with
chains
upon
him
and
seated
where
all
the
curious
eyes
could
stare
at
him
no
less
conspicuous
was
injun
joe
stolid
as
ever
there
was
another
pause
and
then
the
judge
arrived
and
the
sheriff
proclaimed
the
opening
of
the
court
the
usual
whisperings
among
the
lawyers
and
gathering
together
of
papers
followed
these
details
and
accompanying
delays
worked
up
an
atmosphere
of
preparation
that
was
as
impressive
as
it
was
fascinating
now
a
witness
was
called
who
testified
that
he
found
muff
potter
washing
in
the
brook
at
an
early
hour
of
the
morning
that
the
murder
was
discovered
and
that
he
immediately
sneaked
away
after
some
further
questioning
counsel
for
the
prosecution
said
take
the
witness
the
prisoner
raised
his
eyes
for
a
moment
but
dropped
them
again
when
his
own
counsel
said
i
have
no
questions
to
ask
him
the
next
witness
proved
the
finding
of
the
knife
near
the
corpse
counsel
for
the
prosecution
said
take
the
witness
i
have
no
questions
to
ask
him
potter's
lawyer
replied
a
third
witness
swore
he
had
often
seen
the
knife
in
potter's
possession
take
the
witness
counsel
for
potter
declined
to
question
him
the
faces
of
the
audience
began
to
betray
annoyance
did
this
attorney
mean
to
throw
away
his
client's
life
without
an
effort
several
witnesses
deposed
concerning
potter's
guilty
behavior
when
brought
to
the
scene
of
the
murder
they
were
allowed
to
leave
the
stand
without
being
cross
questioned
every
detail
of
the
damaging
circumstances
that
occurred
in
the
graveyard
upon
that
morning
which
all
present
remembered
so
well
was
brought
out
by
credible
witnesses
but
none
of
them
were
cross
examined
by
potter's
lawyer
the
perplexity
and
dissatisfaction
of
the
house
expressed
itself
in
murmurs
and
provoked
a
reproof
from
the
bench
counsel
for
the
prosecution
now
said
by
the
oaths
of
citizens
whose
simple
word
is
above
suspicion
we
have
fastened
this
awful
crime
beyond
all
possibility
of
question
upon
the
unhappy
prisoner
at
the
bar
we
rest
our
case
here
a
groan
escaped
from
poor
potter
and
he
put
his
face
in
his
hands
and
rocked
his
body
softly
to
and
fro
while
a
painful
silence
reigned
in
the
courtroom
many
men
were
moved
and
many
women's
compassion
testified
itself
in
tears
counsel
for
the
defence
rose
and
said
your
honor
in
our
remarks
at
the
opening
of
this
trial
we
foreshadowed
our
purpose
to
prove
that
our
client
did
this
fearful
deed
while
under
the
influence
of
a
blind
and
irresponsible
delirium
produced
by
drink
we
have
changed
our
mind
we
shall
not
offer
that
plea
to
the
clerk
call
thomas
sawyer
a
puzzled
amazement
awoke
in
every
face
in
the
house
not
even
excepting
potter's
every
eye
fastened
itself
with
wondering
interest
upon
tom
as
he
rose
and
took
his
place
upon
the
stand
the
boy
looked
wild
enough
for
he
was
badly
scared
the
oath
was
administered
thomas
sawyer
where
were
you
on
the
seventeenth
of
june
about
the
hour
of
midnight
tom
glanced
at
injun
joe's
iron
face
and
his
tongue
failed
him
the
audience
listened
breathless
but
the
words
refused
to
come
after
a
few
moments
however
the
boy
got
a
little
of
his
strength
back
and
managed
to
put
enough
of
it
into
his
voice
to
make
part
of
the
house
hear
in
the
graveyard
a
little
bit
louder
please
don't
be
afraid
you
were
in
the
graveyard
a
contemptuous
smile
flitted
across
injun
joe's
face
were
you
anywhere
near
horse
williams
grave
yes
sir
speak
up
just
a
trifle
louder
how
near
were
you
near
as
i
am
to
you
were
you
hidden
or
not
i
was
hid
where
behind
the
elms
that's
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
injun
joe
gave
a
barely
perceptible
start
any
one
with
you
yes
sir
i
went
there
with
wait
wait
a
moment
never
mind
mentioning
your
companion's
name
we
will
produce
him
at
the
proper
time
did
you
carry
anything
there
with
you
tom
hesitated
and
looked
confused
speak
out
my
boy
don't
be
diffident
the
truth
is
always
respectable
what
did
you
take
there
only
a
a
dead
cat
there
was
a
ripple
of
mirth
which
the
court
checked
we
will
produce
the
skeleton
of
that
cat
now
my
boy
tell
us
everything
that
occurred
tell
it
in
your
own
way
don't
skip
anything
and
don't
be
afraid
tom
began
hesitatingly
at
first
but
as
he
warmed
to
his
subject
his
words
flowed
more
and
more
easily
in
a
little
while
every
sound
ceased
but
his
own
voice
every
eye
fixed
itself
upon
him
with
parted
lips
and
bated
breath
the
audience
hung
upon
his
words
taking
no
note
of
time
rapt
in
the
ghastly
fascinations
of
the
tale
the
strain
upon
pent
emotion
reached
its
climax
when
the
boy
said
and
as
the
doctor
fetched
the
board
around
and
muff
potter
fell
injun
joe
jumped
with
the
knife
and
crash
quick
as
lightning
the
halfbreed
sprang
for
a
window
tore
his
way
through
all
opposers
and
was
gone
chapter
xxiv
tom
was
a
glittering
hero
once
more
the
pet
of
the
old
the
envy
of
the
young
his
name
even
went
into
immortal
print
for
the
village
paper
magnified
him
there
were
some
that
believed
he
would
be
president
yet
if
he
escaped
hanging
as
usual
the
fickle
unreasoning
world
took
muff
potter
to
its
bosom
and
fondled
him
as
lavishly
as
it
had
abused
him
before
but
that
sort
of
conduct
is
to
the
world's
credit
therefore
it
is
not
well
to
find
fault
with
it
tom's
days
were
days
of
splendor
and
exultation
to
him
but
his
nights
were
seasons
of
horror
injun
joe
infested
all
his
dreams
and
always
with
doom
in
his
eye
hardly
any
temptation
could
persuade
the
boy
to
stir
abroad
after
nightfall
poor
huck
was
in
the
same
state
of
wretchedness
and
terror
for
tom
had
told
the
whole
story
to
the
lawyer
the
night
before
the
great
day
of
the
trial
and
huck
was
sore
afraid
that
his
share
in
the
business
might
leak
out
yet
notwithstanding
injun
joe's
flight
had
saved
him
the
suffering
of
testifying
in
court
the
poor
fellow
had
got
the
attorney
to
promise
secrecy
but
what
of
that
since
tom's
harassed
conscience
had
managed
to
drive
him
to
the
lawyer's
house
by
night
and
wring
a
dread
tale
from
lips
that
had
been
sealed
with
the
dismalest
and
most
formidable
of
oaths
huck's
confidence
in
the
human
race
was
wellnigh
obliterated
daily
muff
potter's
gratitude
made
tom
glad
he
had
spoken
but
nightly
he
wished
he
had
sealed
up
his
tongue
half
the
time
tom
was
afraid
injun
joe
would
never
be
captured
the
other
half
he
was
afraid
he
would
be
he
felt
sure
he
never
could
draw
a
safe
breath
again
until
that
man
was
dead
and
he
had
seen
the
corpse
rewards
had
been
offered
the
country
had
been
scoured
but
no
injun
joe
was
found
one
of
those
omniscient
and
aweinspiring
marvels
a
detective
came
up
from
st
louis
moused
around
shook
his
head
looked
wise
and
made
that
sort
of
astounding
success
which
members
of
that
craft
usually
achieve
that
is
to
say
he
found
a
clew
but
you
can't
hang
a
clew
for
murder
and
so
after
that
detective
had
got
through
and
gone
home
tom
felt
just
as
insecure
as
he
was
before
the
slow
days
drifted
on
and
each
left
behind
it
a
slightly
lightened
weight
of
apprehension
chapter
xxv
there
comes
a
time
in
every
rightly
constructed
boy's
life
when
he
has
a
raging
desire
to
go
somewhere
and
dig
for
hidden
treasure
this
desire
suddenly
came
upon
tom
one
day
he
sallied
out
to
find
joe
harper
but
failed
of
success
next
he
sought
ben
rogers
he
had
gone
fishing
presently
he
stumbled
upon
huck
finn
the
red
handed
huck
would
answer
tom
took
him
to
a
private
place
and
opened
the
matter
to
him
confidentially
huck
was
willing
huck
was
always
willing
to
take
a
hand
in
any
enterprise
that
offered
entertainment
and
required
no
capital
for
he
had
a
troublesome
superabundance
of
that
sort
of
time
which
is
not
money
where'll
we
dig
said
huck
oh
most
anywhere
why
is
it
hid
all
around
no
indeed
it
ain't
it's
hid
in
mighty
particular
places
huck
sometimes
on
islands
sometimes
in
rotten
chests
under
the
end
of
a
limb
of
an
old
dead
tree
just
where
the
shadow
falls
at
midnight
but
mostly
under
the
floor
in
ha'nted
houses
who
hides
it
why
robbers
of
course
who'd
you
reckon
sunday
school
sup'rintendents
i
don't
know
if
twas
mine
i
wouldn't
hide
it
i'd
spend
it
and
have
a
good
time
so
would
i
but
robbers
don't
do
that
way
they
always
hide
it
and
leave
it
there
don't
they
come
after
it
any
more
no
they
think
they
will
but
they
generally
forget
the
marks
or
else
they
die
anyway
it
lays
there
a
long
time
and
gets
rusty
and
by
and
by
somebody
finds
an
old
yellow
paper
that
tells
how
to
find
the
marks
a
paper
that's
got
to
be
ciphered
over
about
a
week
because
it's
mostly
signs
and
hy'roglyphics
hyro
which
hy'roglyphics
pictures
and
things
you
know
that
don't
seem
to
mean
anything
have
you
got
one
of
them
papers
tom
no
well
then
how
you
going
to
find
the
marks
i
don't
want
any
marks
they
always
bury
it
under
a
ha'nted
house
or
on
an
island
or
under
a
dead
tree
that's
got
one
limb
sticking
out
well
we've
tried
jackson's
island
a
little
and
we
can
try
it
again
some
time
and
there's
the
old
ha'nted
house
up
the
still
house
branch
and
there's
lots
of
dead
limb
trees
dead
loads
of
em
is
it
under
all
of
them
how
you
talk
no
then
how
you
going
to
know
which
one
to
go
for
go
for
all
of
em
why
tom
it'll
take
all
summer
well
what
of
that
suppose
you
find
a
brass
pot
with
a
hundred
dollars
in
it
all
rusty
and
gray
or
rotten
chest
full
of
di'monds
how's
that
huck's
eyes
glowed
that's
bully
plenty
bully
enough
for
me
just
you
gimme
the
hundred
dollars
and
i
don't
want
no
di'monds
all
right
but
i
bet
you
i
ain't
going
to
throw
off
on
di'monds
some
of
em's
worth
twenty
dollars
apiece
there
ain't
any
hardly
but's
worth
six
bits
or
a
dollar
no
is
that
so
cert'nly
anybody'll
tell
you
so
hain't
you
ever
seen
one
huck
not
as
i
remember
oh
kings
have
slathers
of
them
well
i
don
know
no
kings
tom
i
reckon
you
don't
but
if
you
was
to
go
to
europe
you'd
see
a
raft
of
em
hopping
around
do
they
hop
hop
your
granny
no
well
what
did
you
say
they
did
for
shucks
i
only
meant
you'd
see
em
not
hopping
of
course
what
do
they
want
to
hop
for
but
i
mean
you'd
just
see
em
scattered
around
you
know
in
a
kind
of
a
general
way
like
that
old
humpbacked
richard
richard
what's
his
other
name
he
didn't
have
any
other
name
kings
don't
have
any
but
a
given
name
no
but
they
don't
well
if
they
like
it
tom
all
right
but
i
don't
want
to
be
a
king
and
have
only
just
a
given
name
like
a
nigger
but
say
where
you
going
to
dig
first
well
i
don't
know
s'pose
we
tackle
that
old
dead
limb
tree
on
the
hill
t'other
side
of
still
house
branch
i'm
agreed
so
they
got
a
crippled
pick
and
a
shovel
and
set
out
on
their
three
mile
tramp
they
arrived
hot
and
panting
and
threw
themselves
down
in
the
shade
of
a
neighboring
elm
to
rest
and
have
a
smoke
i
like
this
said
tom
so
do
i
say
huck
if
we
find
a
treasure
here
what
you
going
to
do
with
your
share
well
i'll
have
pie
and
a
glass
of
soda
every
day
and
i'll
go
to
every
circus
that
comes
along
i
bet
i'll
have
a
gay
time
well
ain't
you
going
to
save
any
of
it
save
it
what
for
why
so
as
to
have
something
to
live
on
by
and
by
oh
that
ain't
any
use
pap
would
come
back
to
thish
yer
town
some
day
and
get
his
claws
on
it
if
i
didn't
hurry
up
and
i
tell
you
he'd
clean
it
out
pretty
quick
what
you
going
to
do
with
yourn
tom
i'm
going
to
buy
a
new
drum
and
a
sure'nough
sword
and
a
red
necktie
and
a
bull
pup
and
get
married
married
that's
it
tom
you
why
you
ain't
in
your
right
mind
wait
you'll
see
well
that's
the
foolishest
thing
you
could
do
look
at
pap
and
my
mother
fight
why
they
used
to
fight
all
the
time
i
remember
mighty
well
that
ain't
anything
the
girl
i'm
going
to
marry
won't
fight
tom
i
reckon
they're
all
alike
they'll
all
comb
a
body
now
you
better
think
bout
this
awhile
i
tell
you
you
better
what's
the
name
of
the
gal
it
ain't
a
gal
at
all
it's
a
girl
it's
all
the
same
i
reckon
some
says
gal
some
says
girl
both's
right
like
enough
anyway
what's
her
name
tom
i'll
tell
you
some
time
not
now
all
right
that'll
do
only
if
you
get
married
i'll
be
more
lonesomer
than
ever
no
you
won't
you'll
come
and
live
with
me
now
stir
out
of
this
and
we'll
go
to
digging
they
worked
and
sweated
for
half
an
hour
no
result
they
toiled
another
halfhour
still
no
result
huck
said
do
they
always
bury
it
as
deep
as
this
sometimes
not
always
not
generally
i
reckon
we
haven't
got
the
right
place
so
they
chose
a
new
spot
and
began
again
the
labor
dragged
a
little
but
still
they
made
progress
they
pegged
away
in
silence
for
some
time
finally
huck
leaned
on
his
shovel
swabbed
the
beaded
drops
from
his
brow
with
his
sleeve
and
said
where
you
going
to
dig
next
after
we
get
this
one
i
reckon
maybe
we'll
tackle
the
old
tree
that's
over
yonder
on
cardiff
hill
back
of
the
widow's
i
reckon
that'll
be
a
good
one
but
won't
the
widow
take
it
away
from
us
tom
it's
on
her
land
she
take
it
away
maybe
she'd
like
to
try
it
once
whoever
finds
one
of
these
hid
treasures
it
belongs
to
him
it
don't
make
any
difference
whose
land
it's
on
that
was
satisfactory
the
work
went
on
by
and
by
huck
said
blame
it
we
must
be
in
the
wrong
place
again
what
do
you
think
it
is
mighty
curious
huck
i
don't
understand
it
sometimes
witches
interfere
i
reckon
maybe
that's
what's
the
trouble
now
shucks
witches
ain't
got
no
power
in
the
daytime
well
that's
so
i
didn't
think
of
that
oh
i
know
what
the
matter
is
what
a
blamed
lot
of
fools
we
are
you
got
to
find
out
where
the
shadow
of
the
limb
falls
at
midnight
and
that's
where
you
dig
then
consound
it
we've
fooled
away
all
this
work
for
nothing
now
hang
it
all
we
got
to
come
back
in
the
night
it's
an
awful
long
way
can
you
get
out
i
bet
i
will
we've
got
to
do
it
tonight
too
because
if
somebody
sees
these
holes
they'll
know
in
a
minute
what's
here
and
they'll
go
for
it
well
i'll
come
around
and
maow
tonight
all
right
let's
hide
the
tools
in
the
bushes
the
boys
were
there
that
night
about
the
appointed
time
they
sat
in
the
shadow
waiting
it
was
a
lonely
place
and
an
hour
made
solemn
by
old
traditions
spirits
whispered
in
the
rustling
leaves
ghosts
lurked
in
the
murky
nooks
the
deep
baying
of
a
hound
floated
up
out
of
the
distance
an
owl
answered
with
his
sepulchral
note
the
boys
were
subdued
by
these
solemnities
and
talked
little
by
and
by
they
judged
that
twelve
had
come
they
marked
where
the
shadow
fell
and
began
to
dig
their
hopes
commenced
to
rise
their
interest
grew
stronger
and
their
industry
kept
pace
with
it
the
hole
deepened
and
still
deepened
but
every
time
their
hearts
jumped
to
hear
the
pick
strike
upon
something
they
only
suffered
a
new
disappointment
it
was
only
a
stone
or
a
chunk
at
last
tom
said
it
ain't
any
use
huck
we're
wrong
again
well
but
we
can't
be
wrong
we
spotted
the
shadder
to
a
dot
i
know
it
but
then
there's
another
thing
what's
that
why
we
only
guessed
at
the
time
like
enough
it
was
too
late
or
too
early
huck
dropped
his
shovel
that's
it
said
he
that's
the
very
trouble
we
got
to
give
this
one
up
we
can't
ever
tell
the
right
time
and
besides
this
kind
of
thing's
too
awful
here
this
time
of
night
with
witches
and
ghosts
a
fluttering
around
so
i
feel
as
if
something's
behind
me
all
the
time
and
i'm
afeard
to
turn
around
becuz
maybe
there's
others
in
front
a
waiting
for
a
chance
i
been
creeping
all
over
ever
since
i
got
here
well
i've
been
pretty
much
so
too
huck
they
most
always
put
in
a
dead
man
when
they
bury
a
treasure
under
a
tree
to
look
out
for
it
lordy
yes
they
do
i've
always
heard
that
tom
i
don't
like
to
fool
around
much
where
there's
dead
people
a
body's
bound
to
get
into
trouble
with
em
sure
i
don't
like
to
stir
em
up
either
s'pose
this
one
here
was
to
stick
his
skull
out
and
say
something
don't
tom
it's
awful
well
it
just
is
huck
i
don't
feel
comfortable
a
bit
say
tom
let's
give
this
place
up
and
try
somewheres
else
all
right
i
reckon
we
better
what'll
it
be
tom
considered
awhile
and
then
said
the
ha'nted
house
that's
it
blame
it
i
don't
like
ha'nted
houses
tom
why
they're
a
dern
sight
worse'n
dead
people
dead
people
might
talk
maybe
but
they
don't
come
sliding
around
in
a
shroud
when
you
ain't
noticing
and
peep
over
your
shoulder
all
of
a
sudden
and
grit
their
teeth
the
way
a
ghost
does
i
couldn't
stand
such
a
thing
as
that
tom
nobody
could
yes
but
huck
ghosts
don't
travel
around
only
at
night
they
won't
hender
us
from
digging
there
in
the
daytime
well
that's
so
but
you
know
mighty
well
people
don't
go
about
that
ha'nted
house
in
the
day
nor
the
night
well
that's
mostly
because
they
don't
like
to
go
where
a
man's
been
murdered
anyway
but
nothing's
ever
been
seen
around
that
house
except
in
the
night
just
some
blue
lights
slipping
by
the
windows
no
regular
ghosts
well
where
you
see
one
of
them
blue
lights
flickering
around
tom
you
can
bet
there's
a
ghost
mighty
close
behind
it
it
stands
to
reason
becuz
you
know
that
they
don't
anybody
but
ghosts
use
em
yes
that's
so
but
anyway
they
don't
come
around
in
the
daytime
so
what's
the
use
of
our
being
afeard
well
all
right
we'll
tackle
the
ha'nted
house
if
you
say
so
but
i
reckon
it's
taking
chances
they
had
started
down
the
hill
by
this
time
there
in
the
middle
of
the
moonlit
valley
below
them
stood
the
ha'nted
house
utterly
isolated
its
fences
gone
long
ago
rank
weeds
smothering
the
very
doorsteps
the
chimney
crumbled
to
ruin
the
window
sashes
vacant
a
corner
of
the
roof
caved
in
the
boys
gazed
awhile
half
expecting
to
see
a
blue
light
flit
past
a
window
then
talking
in
a
low
tone
as
befitted
the
time
and
the
circumstances
they
struck
far
off
to
the
right
to
give
the
haunted
house
a
wide
berth
and
took
their
way
homeward
through
the
woods
that
adorned
the
rearward
side
of
cardiff
hill
chapter
xvi
about
noon
the
next
day
the
boys
arrived
at
the
dead
tree
they
had
come
for
their
tools
tom
was
impatient
to
go
to
the
haunted
house
huck
was
measurably
so
also
but
suddenly
said
lookyhere
tom
do
you
know
what
day
it
is
tom
mentally
ran
over
the
days
of
the
week
and
then
quickly
lifted
his
eyes
with
a
startled
look
in
them
my
i
never
once
thought
of
it
huck
well
i
didn't
neither
but
all
at
once
it
popped
onto
me
that
it
was
friday
blame
it
a
body
can't
be
too
careful
huck
we
might
a
got
into
an
awful
scrape
tackling
such
a
thing
on
a
friday
might
better
say
we
would
there's
some
lucky
days
maybe
but
friday
ain't
any
fool
knows
that
i
don't
reckon
you
was
the
first
that
found
it
out
huck
well
i
never
said
i
was
did
i
and
friday
ain't
all
neither
i
had
a
rotten
bad
dream
last
night
dreampt
about
rats
no
sure
sign
of
trouble
did
they
fight
no
well
that's
good
huck
when
they
don't
fight
it's
only
a
sign
that
there's
trouble
around
you
know
all
we
got
to
do
is
to
look
mighty
sharp
and
keep
out
of
it
we'll
drop
this
thing
for
today
and
play
do
you
know
robin
hood
huck
no
who's
robin
hood
why
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
men
that
was
ever
in
england
and
the
best
he
was
a
robber
cracky
i
wisht
i
was
who
did
he
rob
only
sheriffs
and
bishops
and
rich
people
and
kings
and
such
like
but
he
never
bothered
the
poor
he
loved
em
he
always
divided
up
with
em
perfectly
square
well
he
must
a
been
a
brick
i
bet
you
he
was
huck
oh
he
was
the
noblest
man
that
ever
was
they
ain't
any
such
men
now
i
can
tell
you
he
could
lick
any
man
in
england
with
one
hand
tied
behind
him
and
he
could
take
his
yew
bow
and
plug
a
ten
cent
piece
every
time
a
mile
and
a
half
what's
a
yew
bow
i
don't
know
it's
some
kind
of
a
bow
of
course
and
if
he
hit
that
dime
only
on
the
edge
he
would
set
down
and
cry
and
curse
but
we'll
play
robin
hood
it's
nobby
fun
i'll
learn
you
i'm
agreed
so
they
played
robin
hood
all
the
afternoon
now
and
then
casting
a
yearning
eye
down
upon
the
haunted
house
and
passing
a
remark
about
the
morrow's
prospects
and
possibilities
there
as
the
sun
began
to
sink
into
the
west
they
took
their
way
homeward
athwart
the
long
shadows
of
the
trees
and
soon
were
buried
from
sight
in
the
forests
of
cardiff
hill
on
saturday
shortly
after
noon
the
boys
were
at
the
dead
tree
again
they
had
a
smoke
and
a
chat
in
the
shade
and
then
dug
a
little
in
their
last
hole
not
with
great
hope
but
merely
because
tom
said
there
were
so
many
cases
where
people
had
given
up
a
treasure
after
getting
down
within
six
inches
of
it
and
then
somebody
else
had
come
along
and
turned
it
up
with
a
single
thrust
of
a
shovel
the
thing
failed
this
time
however
so
the
boys
shouldered
their
tools
and
went
away
feeling
that
they
had
not
trifled
with
fortune
but
had
fulfilled
all
the
requirements
that
belong
to
the
business
of
treasure
hunting
when
they
reached
the
haunted
house
there
was
something
so
weird
and
grisly
about
the
dead
silence
that
reigned
there
under
the
baking
sun
and
something
so
depressing
about
the
loneliness
and
desolation
of
the
place
that
they
were
afraid
for
a
moment
to
venture
in
then
they
crept
to
the
door
and
took
a
trembling
peep
they
saw
a
weedgrown
floorless
room
unplastered
an
ancient
fireplace
vacant
windows
a
ruinous
staircase
and
here
there
and
everywhere
hung
ragged
and
abandoned
cobwebs
they
presently
entered
softly
with
quickened
pulses
talking
in
whispers
ears
alert
to
catch
the
slightest
sound
and
muscles
tense
and
ready
for
instant
retreat
in
a
little
while
familiarity
modified
their
fears
and
they
gave
the
place
a
critical
and
interested
examination
rather
admiring
their
own
boldness
and
wondering
at
it
too
next
they
wanted
to
look
upstairs
this
was
something
like
cutting
off
retreat
but
they
got
to
daring
each
other
and
of
course
there
could
be
but
one
result
they
threw
their
tools
into
a
corner
and
made
the
ascent
up
there
were
the
same
signs
of
decay
in
one
corner
they
found
a
closet
that
promised
mystery
but
the
promise
was
a
fraud
there
was
nothing
in
it
their
courage
was
up
now
and
well
in
hand
they
were
about
to
go
down
and
begin
work
when
sh
said
tom
what
is
it
whispered
huck
blanching
with
fright
sh
there
hear
it
yes
oh
my
let's
run
keep
still
don't
you
budge
they're
coming
right
toward
the
door
the
boys
stretched
themselves
upon
the
floor
with
their
eyes
to
knotholes
in
the
planking
and
lay
waiting
in
a
misery
of
fear
they've
stopped
no
coming
here
they
are
don't
whisper
another
word
huck
my
goodness
i
wish
i
was
out
of
this
two
men
entered
each
boy
said
to
himself
there's
the
old
deaf
and
dumb
spaniard
that's
been
about
town
once
or
twice
lately
never
saw
t'other
man
before
t'other
was
a
ragged
unkempt
creature
with
nothing
very
pleasant
in
his
face
the
spaniard
was
wrapped
in
a
serape
he
had
bushy
white
whiskers
long
white
hair
flowed
from
under
his
sombrero
and
he
wore
green
goggles
when
they
came
in
t'other
was
talking
in
a
low
voice
they
sat
down
on
the
ground
facing
the
door
with
their
backs
to
the
wall
and
the
speaker
continued
his
remarks
his
manner
became
less
guarded
and
his
words
more
distinct
as
he
proceeded
no
said
he
i've
thought
it
all
over
and
i
don't
like
it
it's
dangerous
dangerous
grunted
the
deaf
and
dumb
spaniard
to
the
vast
surprise
of
the
boys
milksop
this
voice
made
the
boys
gasp
and
quake
it
was
injun
joe's
there
was
silence
for
some
time
then
joe
said
what's
any
more
dangerous
than
that
job
up
yonder
but
nothing's
come
of
it
that's
different
away
up
the
river
so
and
not
another
house
about
twon't
ever
be
known
that
we
tried
anyway
long
as
we
didn't
succeed
well
what's
more
dangerous
than
coming
here
in
the
daytime
anybody
would
suspicion
us
that
saw
us
i
know
that
but
there
warn't
any
other
place
as
handy
after
that
fool
of
a
job
i
want
to
quit
this
shanty
i
wanted
to
yesterday
only
it
warn't
any
use
trying
to
stir
out
of
here
with
those
infernal
boys
playing
over
there
on
the
hill
right
in
full
view
those
infernal
boys
quaked
again
under
the
inspiration
of
this
remark
and
thought
how
lucky
it
was
that
they
had
remembered
it
was
friday
and
concluded
to
wait
a
day
they
wished
in
their
hearts
they
had
waited
a
year
the
two
men
got
out
some
food
and
made
a
luncheon
after
a
long
and
thoughtful
silence
injun
joe
said
look
here
lad
you
go
back
up
the
river
where
you
belong
wait
there
till
you
hear
from
me
i'll
take
the
chances
on
dropping
into
this
town
just
once
more
for
a
look
we'll
do
that
dangerous
job
after
i've
spied
around
a
little
and
think
things
look
well
for
it
then
for
texas
we'll
leg
it
together
this
was
satisfactory
both
men
presently
fell
to
yawning
and
injun
joe
said
i'm
dead
for
sleep
it's
your
turn
to
watch
he
curled
down
in
the
weeds
and
soon
began
to
snore
his
comrade
stirred
him
once
or
twice
and
he
became
quiet
presently
the
watcher
began
to
nod
his
head
drooped
lower
and
lower
both
men
began
to
snore
now
the
boys
drew
a
long
grateful
breath
tom
whispered
now's
our
chance
come
huck
said
i
can't
i'd
die
if
they
was
to
wake
tom
urged
huck
held
back
at
last
tom
rose
slowly
and
softly
and
started
alone
but
the
first
step
he
made
wrung
such
a
hideous
creak
from
the
crazy
floor
that
he
sank
down
almost
dead
with
fright
he
never
made
a
second
attempt
the
boys
lay
there
counting
the
dragging
moments
till
it
seemed
to
them
that
time
must
be
done
and
eternity
growing
gray
and
then
they
were
grateful
to
note
that
at
last
the
sun
was
setting
now
one
snore
ceased
injun
joe
sat
up
stared
around
smiled
grimly
upon
his
comrade
whose
head
was
drooping
upon
his
knees
stirred
him
up
with
his
foot
and
said
here
you're
a
watchman
ain't
you
all
right
though
nothing's
happened
my
have
i
been
asleep
oh
partly
partly
nearly
time
for
us
to
be
moving
pard
what'll
we
do
with
what
little
swag
we've
got
left
i
don't
know
leave
it
here
as
we've
always
done
i
reckon
no
use
to
take
it
away
till
we
start
south
six
hundred
and
fifty
in
silver's
something
to
carry
well
all
right
it
won't
matter
to
come
here
once
more
no
but
i'd
say
come
in
the
night
as
we
used
to
do
it's
better
yes
but
look
here
it
may
be
a
good
while
before
i
get
the
right
chance
at
that
job
accidents
might
happen
tain't
in
such
a
very
good
place
we'll
just
regularly
bury
it
and
bury
it
deep
good
idea
said
the
comrade
who
walked
across
the
room
knelt
down
raised
one
of
the
rearward
hearth
stones
and
took
out
a
bag
that
jingled
pleasantly
he
subtracted
from
it
twenty
or
thirty
dollars
for
himself
and
as
much
for
injun
joe
and
passed
the
bag
to
the
latter
who
was
on
his
knees
in
the
corner
now
digging
with
his
bowie
knife
the
boys
forgot
all
their
fears
all
their
miseries
in
an
instant
with
gloating
eyes
they
watched
every
movement
luck
the
splendor
of
it
was
beyond
all
imagination
six
hundred
dollars
was
money
enough
to
make
half
a
dozen
boys
rich
here
was
treasure
hunting
under
the
happiest
auspices
there
would
not
be
any
bothersome
uncertainty
as
to
where
to
dig
they
nudged
each
other
every
moment
eloquent
nudges
and
easily
understood
for
they
simply
meant
oh
but
ain't
you
glad
now
we're
here
joe's
knife
struck
upon
something
hello
said
he
what
is
it
said
his
comrade
half
rotten
plank
no
it's
a
box
i
believe
here
bear
a
hand
and
we'll
see
what
it's
here
for
never
mind
i've
broke
a
hole
he
reached
his
hand
in
and
drew
it
out
man
it's
money
the
two
men
examined
the
handful
of
coins
they
were
gold
the
boys
above
were
as
excited
as
themselves
and
as
delighted
joe's
comrade
said
we'll
make
quick
work
of
this
there's
an
old
rusty
pick
over
amongst
the
weeds
in
the
corner
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
i
saw
it
a
minute
ago
he
ran
and
brought
the
boys
pick
and
shovel
injun
joe
took
the
pick
looked
it
over
critically
shook
his
head
muttered
something
to
himself
and
then
began
to
use
it
the
box
was
soon
unearthed
it
was
not
very
large
it
was
iron
bound
and
had
been
very
strong
before
the
slow
years
had
injured
it
the
men
contemplated
the
treasure
awhile
in
blissful
silence
pard
there's
thousands
of
dollars
here
said
injun
joe
twas
always
said
that
murrel's
gang
used
to
be
around
here
one
summer
the
stranger
observed
i
know
it
said
injun
joe
and
this
looks
like
it
i
should
say
now
you
won't
need
to
do
that
job
the
halfbreed
frowned
said
he
you
don't
know
me
least
you
don't
know
all
about
that
thing
tain't
robbery
altogether
it's
revenge
and
a
wicked
light
flamed
in
his
eyes
i'll
need
your
help
in
it
when
it's
finished
then
texas
go
home
to
your
nance
and
your
kids
and
stand
by
till
you
hear
from
me
well
if
you
say
so
what'll
we
do
with
this
bury
it
again
yes
delight
overhead
no
by
the
great
sachem
no
distress
overhead
i'd
nearly
forgot
that
pick
had
fresh
earth
on
it
boys
were
sick
with
terror
in
a
moment
what
business
has
a
pick
and
a
shovel
here
what
business
with
fresh
earth
on
them
who
brought
them
here
and
where
are
they
gone
have
you
heard
anybody
seen
anybody
what
bury
it
again
and
leave
them
to
come
and
see
the
ground
disturbed
not
exactly
not
exactly
we'll
take
it
to
my
den
why
of
course
might
have
thought
of
that
before
you
mean
number
one
no
number
two
under
the
cross
the
other
place
is
bad
too
common
all
right
it's
nearly
dark
enough
to
start
injun
joe
got
up
and
went
about
from
window
to
window
cautiously
peeping
out
presently
he
said
who
could
have
brought
those
tools
here
do
you
reckon
they
can
be
upstairs
the
boys
breath
forsook
them
injun
joe
put
his
hand
on
his
knife
halted
a
moment
undecided
and
then
turned
toward
the
stairway
the
boys
thought
of
the
closet
but
their
strength
was
gone
the
steps
came
creaking
up
the
stairs
the
intolerable
distress
of
the
situation
woke
the
stricken
resolution
of
the
lads
they
were
about
to
spring
for
the
closet
when
there
was
a
crash
of
rotten
timbers
and
injun
joe
landed
on
the
ground
amid
the
debris
of
the
ruined
stairway
he
gathered
himself
up
cursing
and
his
comrade
said
now
what's
the
use
of
all
that
if
it's
anybody
and
they're
up
there
let
them
stay
there
who
cares
if
they
want
to
jump
down
now
and
get
into
trouble
who
objects
it
will
be
dark
in
fifteen
minutes
and
then
let
them
follow
us
if
they
want
to
i'm
willing
in
my
opinion
whoever
hove
those
things
in
here
caught
a
sight
of
us
and
took
us
for
ghosts
or
devils
or
something
i'll
bet
they're
running
yet
joe
grumbled
awhile
then
he
agreed
with
his
friend
that
what
daylight
was
left
ought
to
be
economized
in
getting
things
ready
for
leaving
shortly
afterward
they
slipped
out
of
the
house
in
the
deepening
twilight
and
moved
toward
the
river
with
their
precious
box
tom
and
huck
rose
up
weak
but
vastly
relieved
and
stared
after
them
through
the
chinks
between
the
logs
of
the
house
follow
not
they
they
were
content
to
reach
ground
again
without
broken
necks
and
take
the
townward
track
over
the
hill
they
did
not
talk
much
they
were
too
much
absorbed
in
hating
themselves
hating
the
ill
luck
that
made
them
take
the
spade
and
the
pick
there
but
for
that
injun
joe
never
would
have
suspected
he
would
have
hidden
the
silver
with
the
gold
to
wait
there
till
his
revenge
was
satisfied
and
then
he
would
have
had
the
misfortune
to
find
that
money
turn
up
missing
bitter
bitter
luck
that
the
tools
were
ever
brought
there
they
resolved
to
keep
a
lookout
for
that
spaniard
when
he
should
come
to
town
spying
out
for
chances
to
do
his
revengeful
job
and
follow
him
to
number
two
wherever
that
might
be
then
a
ghastly
thought
occurred
to
tom
revenge
what
if
he
means
us
huck
oh
don't
said
huck
nearly
fainting
they
talked
it
all
over
and
as
they
entered
town
they
agreed
to
believe
that
he
might
possibly
mean
somebody
else
at
least
that
he
might
at
least
mean
nobody
but
tom
since
only
tom
had
testified
very
very
small
comfort
it
was
to
tom
to
be
alone
in
danger
company
would
be
a
palpable
improvement
he
thought
chapter
xxvii
the
adventure
of
the
day
mightily
tormented
tom's
dreams
that
night
four
times
he
had
his
hands
on
that
rich
treasure
and
four
times
it
wasted
to
nothingness
in
his
fingers
as
sleep
forsook
him
and
wakefulness
brought
back
the
hard
reality
of
his
misfortune
as
he
lay
in
the
early
morning
recalling
the
incidents
of
his
great
adventure
he
noticed
that
they
seemed
curiously
subdued
and
far
away
somewhat
as
if
they
had
happened
in
another
world
or
in
a
time
long
gone
by
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
great
adventure
itself
must
be
a
dream
there
was
one
very
strong
argument
in
favor
of
this
idea
namely
that
the
quantity
of
coin
he
had
seen
was
too
vast
to
be
real
he
had
never
seen
as
much
as
fifty
dollars
in
one
mass
before
and
he
was
like
all
boys
of
his
age
and
station
in
life
in
that
he
imagined
that
all
references
to
hundreds
and
thousands
were
mere
fanciful
forms
of
speech
and
that
no
such
sums
really
existed
in
the
world
he
never
had
supposed
for
a
moment
that
so
large
a
sum
as
a
hundred
dollars
was
to
be
found
in
actual
money
in
any
one's
possession
if
his
notions
of
hidden
treasure
had
been
analyzed
they
would
have
been
found
to
consist
of
a
handful
of
real
dimes
and
a
bushel
of
vague
splendid
ungraspable
dollars
but
the
incidents
of
his
adventure
grew
sensibly
sharper
and
clearer
under
the
attrition
of
thinking
them
over
and
so
he
presently
found
himself
leaning
to
the
impression
that
the
thing
might
not
have
been
a
dream
after
all
this
uncertainty
must
be
swept
away
he
would
snatch
a
hurried
breakfast
and
go
and
find
huck
huck
was
sitting
on
the
gunwale
of
a
flatboat
listlessly
dangling
his
feet
in
the
water
and
looking
very
melancholy
tom
concluded
to
let
huck
lead
up
to
the
subject
if
he
did
not
do
it
then
the
adventure
would
be
proved
to
have
been
only
a
dream
hello
huck
hello
yourself
silence
for
a
minute
tom
if
we'd
a
left
the
blame
tools
at
the
dead
tree
we'd
a
got
the
money
oh
ain't
it
awful
tain't
a
dream
then
tain't
a
dream
somehow
i
most
wish
it
was
dog'd
if
i
don't
huck
what
ain't
a
dream
oh
that
thing
yesterday
i
been
half
thinking
it
was
dream
if
them
stairs
hadn't
broke
down
you'd
a
seen
how
much
dream
it
was
i've
had
dreams
enough
all
night
with
that
patch
eyed
spanish
devil
going
for
me
all
through
em
rot
him
no
not
rot
him
find
him
track
the
money
tom
we'll
never
find
him
a
feller
don't
have
only
one
chance
for
such
a
pile
and
that
one's
lost
i'd
feel
mighty
shaky
if
i
was
to
see
him
anyway
well
so'd
i
but
i'd
like
to
see
him
anyway
and
track
him
out
to
his
number
two
number
two
yes
that's
it
i
been
thinking
bout
that
but
i
can't
make
nothing
out
of
it
what
do
you
reckon
it
is
i
dono
it's
too
deep
say
huck
maybe
it's
the
number
of
a
house
goody
no
tom
that
ain't
it
if
it
is
it
ain't
in
this
one
horse
town
they
ain't
no
numbers
here
well
that's
so
lemme
think
a
minute
here
it's
the
number
of
a
room
in
a
tavern
you
know
oh
that's
the
trick
they
ain't
only
two
taverns
we
can
find
out
quick
you
stay
here
huck
till
i
come
tom
was
off
at
once
he
did
not
care
to
have
huck's
company
in
public
places
he
was
gone
half
an
hour
he
found
that
in
the
best
tavern
no
had
long
been
occupied
by
a
young
lawyer
and
was
still
so
occupied
in
the
less
ostentatious
house
no
was
a
mystery
the
tavern
keeper's
young
son
said
it
was
kept
locked
all
the
time
and
he
never
saw
anybody
go
into
it
or
come
out
of
it
except
at
night
he
did
not
know
any
particular
reason
for
this
state
of
things
had
had
some
little
curiosity
but
it
was
rather
feeble
had
made
the
most
of
the
mystery
by
entertaining
himself
with
the
idea
that
that
room
was
ha'nted
had
noticed
that
there
was
a
light
in
there
the
night
before
that's
what
i've
found
out
huck
i
reckon
that's
the
very
no
we're
after
i
reckon
it
is
tom
now
what
you
going
to
do
lemme
think
tom
thought
a
long
time
then
he
said
i'll
tell
you
the
back
door
of
that
no
is
the
door
that
comes
out
into
that
little
close
alley
between
the
tavern
and
the
old
rattle
trap
of
a
brick
store
now
you
get
hold
of
all
the
doorkeys
you
can
find
and
i'll
nip
all
of
auntie's
and
the
first
dark
night
we'll
go
there
and
try
em
and
mind
you
keep
a
lookout
for
injun
joe
because
he
said
he
was
going
to
drop
into
town
and
spy
around
once
more
for
a
chance
to
get
his
revenge
if
you
see
him
you
just
follow
him
and
if
he
don't
go
to
that
no
that
ain't
the
place
lordy
i
don't
want
to
foller
him
by
myself
why
it'll
be
night
sure
he
mightn't
ever
see
you
and
if
he
did
maybe
he'd
never
think
anything
well
if
it's
pretty
dark
i
reckon
i'll
track
him
i
dono
i
dono
i'll
try
you
bet
i'll
follow
him
if
it's
dark
huck
why
he
might
a
found
out
he
couldn't
get
his
revenge
and
be
going
right
after
that
money
it's
so
tom
it's
so
i'll
foller
him
i
will
by
jingoes
now
you're
talking
don't
you
ever
weaken
huck
and
i
won't
chapter
xxviii
that
night
tom
and
huck
were
ready
for
their
adventure
they
hung
about
the
neighborhood
of
the
tavern
until
after
nine
one
watching
the
alley
at
a
distance
and
the
other
the
tavern
door
nobody
entered
the
alley
or
left
it
nobody
resembling
the
spaniard
entered
or
left
the
tavern
door
the
night
promised
to
be
a
fair
one
so
tom
went
home
with
the
understanding
that
if
a
considerable
degree
of
darkness
came
on
huck
was
to
come
and
maow
whereupon
he
would
slip
out
and
try
the
keys
but
the
night
remained
clear
and
huck
closed
his
watch
and
retired
to
bed
in
an
empty
sugar
hogshead
about
twelve
tuesday
the
boys
had
the
same
ill
luck
also
wednesday
but
thursday
night
promised
better
tom
slipped
out
in
good
season
with
his
aunt's
old
tin
lantern
and
a
large
towel
to
blindfold
it
with
he
hid
the
lantern
in
huck's
sugar
hogshead
and
the
watch
began
an
hour
before
midnight
the
tavern
closed
up
and
its
lights
the
only
ones
thereabouts
were
put
out
no
spaniard
had
been
seen
nobody
had
entered
or
left
the
alley
everything
was
auspicious
the
blackness
of
darkness
reigned
the
perfect
stillness
was
interrupted
only
by
occasional
mutterings
of
distant
thunder
tom
got
his
lantern
lit
it
in
the
hogshead
wrapped
it
closely
in
the
towel
and
the
two
adventurers
crept
in
the
gloom
toward
the
tavern
huck
stood
sentry
and
tom
felt
his
way
into
the
alley
then
there
was
a
season
of
waiting
anxiety
that
weighed
upon
huck's
spirits
like
a
mountain
he
began
to
wish
he
could
see
a
flash
from
the
lantern
it
would
frighten
him
but
it
would
at
least
tell
him
that
tom
was
alive
yet
it
seemed
hours
since
tom
had
disappeared
surely
he
must
have
fainted
maybe
he
was
dead
maybe
his
heart
had
burst
under
terror
and
excitement
in
his
uneasiness
huck
found
himself
drawing
closer
and
closer
to
the
alley
fearing
all
sorts
of
dreadful
things
and
momentarily
expecting
some
catastrophe
to
happen
that
would
take
away
his
breath
there
was
not
much
to
take
away
for
he
seemed
only
able
to
inhale
it
by
thimblefuls
and
his
heart
would
soon
wear
itself
out
the
way
it
was
beating
suddenly
there
was
a
flash
of
light
and
tom
came
tearing
by
him
run
said
he
run
for
your
life
he
needn't
have
repeated
it
once
was
enough
huck
was
making
thirty
or
forty
miles
an
hour
before
the
repetition
was
uttered
the
boys
never
stopped
till
they
reached
the
shed
of
a
deserted
slaughter
house
at
the
lower
end
of
the
village
just
as
they
got
within
its
shelter
the
storm
burst
and
the
rain
poured
down
as
soon
as
tom
got
his
breath
he
said
huck
it
was
awful
i
tried
two
of
the
keys
just
as
soft
as
i
could
but
they
seemed
to
make
such
a
power
of
racket
that
i
couldn't
hardly
get
my
breath
i
was
so
scared
they
wouldn't
turn
in
the
lock
either
well
without
noticing
what
i
was
doing
i
took
hold
of
the
knob
and
open
comes
the
door
it
warn't
locked
i
hopped
in
and
shook
off
the
towel
and
great
caesar's
ghost
what
what'd
you
see
tom
huck
i
most
stepped
onto
injun
joe's
hand
no
yes
he
was
lying
there
sound
asleep
on
the
floor
with
his
old
patch
on
his
eye
and
his
arms
spread
out
lordy
what
did
you
do
did
he
wake
up
no
never
budged
drunk
i
reckon
i
just
grabbed
that
towel
and
started
i'd
never
a
thought
of
the
towel
i
bet
well
i
would
my
aunt
would
make
me
mighty
sick
if
i
lost
it
say
tom
did
you
see
that
box
huck
i
didn't
wait
to
look
around
i
didn't
see
the
box
i
didn't
see
the
cross
i
didn't
see
anything
but
a
bottle
and
a
tin
cup
on
the
floor
by
injun
joe
yes
i
saw
two
barrels
and
lots
more
bottles
in
the
room
don't
you
see
now
what's
the
matter
with
that
ha'nted
room
how
why
it's
ha'nted
with
whiskey
maybe
all
the
temperance
taverns
have
got
a
ha'nted
room
hey
huck
well
i
reckon
maybe
that's
so
who'd
a
thought
such
a
thing
but
say
tom
now's
a
mighty
good
time
to
get
that
box
if
injun
joe's
drunk
it
is
that
you
try
it
huck
shuddered
well
no
i
reckon
not
and
i
reckon
not
huck
only
one
bottle
alongside
of
injun
joe
ain't
enough
if
there'd
been
three
he'd
be
drunk
enough
and
i'd
do
it
there
was
a
long
pause
for
reflection
and
then
tom
said
lookyhere
huck
less
not
try
that
thing
any
more
till
we
know
injun
joe's
not
in
there
it's
too
scary
now
if
we
watch
every
night
we'll
be
dead
sure
to
see
him
go
out
some
time
or
other
and
then
we'll
snatch
that
box
quicker'n
lightning
well
i'm
agreed
i'll
watch
the
whole
night
long
and
i'll
do
it
every
night
too
if
you'll
do
the
other
part
of
the
job
all
right
i
will
all
you

to
do

to
trot

block
and
maow
and
if

throw
some
gravel
at
the
window
and

chapter
xxix
the
first
thing
tom
heard
on
friday
morning
was
a
glad
piece
of
news
judge
thatcher's
family
had
come
back
to
town
the
night
before
both
injun
joe
and
the
treasure
sunk
into
secondary
importance
for
a
moment
and
becky
took
the
chief
place
in
the
boy's
interest
he
saw
her
and
they
had
an
exhausting
good
time
playing
hispy
and
gully
keeper
with
a
crowd
of
their
schoolmates
the
day
was
completed
and
crowned
in
a
peculiarly
satisfactory
way
becky
teased
her
mother
to
appoint
the
next
day
for
the
long
promised
and
long
delayed
picnic
and
she
consented
the
child's
delight
was
boundless
and
tom's
not
more
moderate
the
invitations
were
sent
out
before
sunset
and
straightway
the
young
folks
of
the
village
were
thrown
into
a
fever
of
preparation
and
pleasurable
anticipation
tom's
excitement
enabled
him
to
keep
awake
until
a
pretty
late
hour
and
he
had
good
hopes
of
hearing
huck's
maow
and
of
having
his
treasure
to
astonish
becky
and
the
picnickers
with
next
day
but
he
was
disappointed
no
signal
came
that
night
morning
came
eventually
and
by
ten
or
eleven
o'clock
a
giddy
and
rollicking
company
were
gathered
at
judge
thatcher's
and
everything
was
ready
for
a
start
it
was
not
the
custom
for
elderly
people
to
mar
the
picnics
with
their
presence
the
children
were
considered
safe
enough
under
the
wings
of
a
few
young
ladies
of
eighteen
and
a
few
young
gentlemen
of
twenty
three
or
thereabouts
the
old
steam
ferry
boat
was
chartered
for
the
occasion
presently
the
gay
throng
filed
up
the
main
street
laden
with
provision
baskets
sid
was
sick
and
had
to
miss
the
fun
mary
remained
at
home
to
entertain
him
the
last
thing
mrs
thatcher
said
to
becky
was
you'll
not
get
back
till
late
perhaps
you'd
better
stay
all
night
with
some
of
the
girls
that
live
near
the
ferry
landing
child
then
i'll
stay
with
susy
harper
mamma
very
well
and
mind
and
behave
yourself
and
don't
be
any
trouble
presently
as
they
tripped
along
tom
said
to
becky
say
i'll
tell
you
what
we'll
do
stead
of
going
to
joe
harper's
we'll
climb
right
up
the
hill
and
stop
at
the
widow
douglas
she'll
have
ice
cream
she
has
it
most
every
day
dead
loads
of
it
and
she'll
be
awful
glad
to
have
us
oh
that
will
be
fun
then
becky
reflected
a
moment
and
said
but
what
will
mamma
say
how'll
she
ever
know
the
girl
turned
the
idea
over
in
her
mind
and
said
reluctantly
i
reckon
it's
wrong
but
but
shucks
your
mother
won't
know
and
so
what's
the
harm
all
she
wants
is
that
you'll
be
safe
and
i
bet
you
she'd
a
said
go
there
if
she'd
a
thought
of
it
i
know
she
would
the
widow
douglas
splendid
hospitality
was
a
tempting
bait
it
and
tom's
persuasions
presently
carried
the
day
so
it
was
decided
to
say
nothing
to
anybody
about
the
night's
programme
presently
it
occurred
to
tom
that
maybe
huck
might
come
this
very
night
and
give
the
signal
the
thought
took
a
deal
of
the
spirit
out
of
his
anticipations
still
he
could
not
bear
to
give
up
the
fun
at
widow
douglas
and
why
should
he
give
it
up
he
reasoned
the
signal
did
not
come
the
night
before
so
why
should
it
be
any
more
likely
to
come
tonight
the
sure
fun
of
the
evening
outweighed
the
uncertain
treasure
and
boy
like
he
determined
to
yield
to
the
stronger
inclination
and
not
allow
himself
to
think
of
the
box
of
money
another
time
that
day
three
miles
below
town
the
ferryboat
stopped
at
the
mouth
of
a
woody
hollow
and
tied
up
the
crowd
swarmed
ashore
and
soon
the
forest
distances
and
craggy
heights
echoed
far
and
near
with
shoutings
and
laughter
all
the
different
ways
of
getting
hot
and
tired
were
gone
through
with
and
by
and
by
the
rovers
straggled
back
to
camp
fortified
with
responsible
appetites
and
then
the
destruction
of
the
good
things
began
after
the
feast
there
was
a
refreshing
season
of
rest
and
chat
in
the
shade
of
spreading
oaks
by
and
by
somebody
shouted
who's
ready
for
the
cave
everybody
was
bundles
of
candles
were
procured
and
straightway
there
was
a
general
scamper
up
the
hill
the
mouth
of
the
cave
was
up
the
hillside
an
opening
shaped
like
a
letter
a
its
massive
oaken
door
stood
unbarred
within
was
a
small
chamber
chilly
as
an
icehouse
and
walled
by
nature
with
solid
limestone
that
was
dewy
with
a
cold
sweat
it
was
romantic
and
mysterious
to
stand
here
in
the
deep
gloom
and
look
out
upon
the
green
valley
shining
in
the
sun
but
the
impressiveness
of
the
situation
quickly
wore
off
and
the
romping
began
again
the
moment
a
candle
was
lighted
there
was
a
general
rush
upon
the
owner
of
it
a
struggle
and
a
gallant
defence
followed
but
the
candle
was
soon
knocked
down
or
blown
out
and
then
there
was
a
glad
clamor
of
laughter
and
a
new
chase
but
all
things
have
an
end
by
and
by
the
procession
went
filing
down
the
steep
descent
of
the
main
avenue
the
flickering
rank
of
lights
dimly
revealing
the
lofty
walls
of
rock
almost
to
their
point
of
junction
sixty
feet
overhead
this
main
avenue
was
not
more
than
eight
or
ten
feet
wide
every
few
steps
other
lofty
and
still
narrower
crevices
branched
from
it
on
either
hand
for
mcdougal's
cave
was
but
a
vast
labyrinth
of
crooked
aisles
that
ran
into
each
other
and
out
again
and
led
nowhere
it
was
said
that
one
might
wander
days
and
nights
together
through
its
intricate
tangle
of
rifts
and
chasms
and
never
find
the
end
of
the
cave
and
that
he
might
go
down
and
down
and
still
down
into
the
earth
and
it
was
just
the
same
labyrinth
under
labyrinth
and
no
end
to
any
of
them
no
man
knew
the
cave
that
was
an
impossible
thing
most
of
the
young
men
knew
a
portion
of
it
and
it
was
not
customary
to
venture
much
beyond
this
known
portion
tom
sawyer
knew
as
much
of
the
cave
as
any
one
the
procession
moved
along
the
main
avenue
some
three
quarters
of
a
mile
and
then
groups
and
couples
began
to
slip
aside
into
branch
avenues
fly
along
the
dismal
corridors
and
take
each
other
by
surprise
at
points
where
the
corridors
joined
again
parties
were
able
to
elude
each
other
for
the
space
of
half
an
hour
without
going
beyond
the
known
ground
by
and
by
one
group
after
another
came
straggling
back
to
the
mouth
of
the
cave
panting
hilarious
smeared
from
head
to
foot
with
tallow
drippings
daubed
with
clay
and
entirely
delighted
with
the
success
of
the
day
then
they
were
astonished
to
find
that
they
had
been
taking
no
note
of
time
and
that
night
was
about
at
hand
the
clanging
bell
had
been
calling
for
half
an
hour
however
this
sort
of
close
to
the
day's
adventures
was
romantic
and
therefore
satisfactory
when
the
ferryboat
with
her
wild
freight
pushed
into
the
stream
nobody
cared
sixpence
for
the
wasted
time
but
the
captain
of
the
craft
huck
was
already
upon
his
watch
when
the
ferryboat's
lights
went
glinting
past
the
wharf
he
heard
no
noise
on
board
for
the
young
people
were
as
subdued
and
still
as
people
usually
are
who
are
nearly
tired
to
death
he
wondered
what
boat
it
was
and
why
she
did
not
stop
at
the
wharf
and
then
he
dropped
her
out
of
his
mind
and
put
his
attention
upon
his
business
the
night
was
growing
cloudy
and
dark
ten
o'clock
came
and
the
noise
of
vehicles
ceased
scattered
lights
began
to
wink
out
all
straggling
foot
passengers
disappeared
the
village
betook
itself
to
its
slumbers
and
left
the
small
watcher
alone
with
the
silence
and
the
ghosts
eleven
o'clock
came
and
the
tavern
lights
were
put
out
darkness
everywhere
now
huck
waited
what
seemed
a
weary
long
time
but
nothing
happened
his
faith
was
weakening
was
there
any
use
was
there
really
any
use
why
not
give
it
up
and
turn
in
a
noise
fell
upon
his
ear
he
was
all
attention
in
an
instant
the
alley
door
closed
softly
he
sprang
to
the
corner
of
the
brick
store
the
next
moment
two
men
brushed
by
him
and
one
seemed
to
have
something
under
his
arm
it
must
be
that
box
so
they
were
going
to
remove
the
treasure
why
call
tom
now
it
would
be
absurd
the
men
would
get
away
with
the
box
and
never
be
found
again
no
he
would
stick
to
their
wake
and
follow
them
he
would
trust
to
the
darkness
for
security
from
discovery
so
communing
with
himself
huck
stepped
out
and
glided
along
behind
the
men
cat
like
with
bare
feet
allowing
them
to
keep
just
far
enough
ahead
not
to
be
invisible
they
moved
up
the
river
street
three
blocks
then
turned
to
the
left
up
a
crossstreet
they
went
straight
ahead
then
until
they
came
to
the
path
that
led
up
cardiff
hill
this
they
took
they
passed
by
the
old
welshman's
house
halfway
up
the
hill
without
hesitating
and
still
climbed
upward
good
thought
huck
they
will
bury
it
in
the
old
quarry
but
they
never
stopped
at
the
quarry
they
passed
on
up
the
summit
they
plunged
into
the
narrow
path
between
the
tall
sumach
bushes
and
were
at
once
hidden
in
the
gloom
huck
closed
up
and
shortened
his
distance
now
for
they
would
never
be
able
to
see
him
he
trotted
along
awhile
then
slackened
his
pace
fearing
he
was
gaining
too
fast
moved
on
a
piece
then
stopped
altogether
listened
no
sound
none
save
that
he
seemed
to
hear
the
beating
of
his
own
heart
the
hooting
of
an
owl
came
over
the
hill
ominous
sound
but
no
footsteps
heavens
was
everything
lost
he
was
about
to
spring
with
winged
feet
when
a
man
cleared
his
throat
not
four
feet
from
him
huck's
heart
shot
into
his
throat
but
he
swallowed
it
again
and
then
he
stood
there
shaking
as
if
a
dozen
agues
had
taken
charge
of
him
at
once
and
so
weak
that
he
thought
he
must
surely
fall
to
the
ground
he
knew
where
he
was
he
knew
he
was
within
five
steps
of
the
stile
leading
into
widow
douglas
grounds
very
well
he
thought
let
them
bury
it
there
it
won't
be
hard
to
find
now
there
was
a
voice
a
very
low
voice
injun
joe's
damn
her
maybe
she's
got
company
there's
lights
late
as
it
is
i
can't
see
any
this
was
that
stranger's
voice
the
stranger
of
the
haunted
house
a
deadly
chill
went
to
huck's
heart
this
then
was
the
revenge
job
his
thought
was
to
fly
then
he
remembered
that
the
widow
douglas
had
been
kind
to
him
more
than
once
and
maybe
these
men
were
going
to
murder
her
he
wished
he
dared
venture
to
warn
her
but
he
knew
he
didn't
dare
they
might
come
and
catch
him
he
thought
all
this
and
more
in
the
moment
that
elapsed
between
the
stranger's
remark
and
injun
joe's
next
which
was
because
the
bush
is
in
your
way
now
this
way
now
you
see
don't
you
yes
well
there
is
company
there
i
reckon
better
give
it
up
give
it
up
and
i
just
leaving
this
country
forever
give
it
up
and
maybe
never
have
another
chance
i
tell
you
again
as
i've
told
you
before
i
don't
care
for
her
swag
you
may
have
it
but
her
husband
was
rough
on
me
many
times
he
was
rough
on
me
and
mainly
he
was
the
justice
of
the
peace
that
jugged
me
for
a
vagrant
and
that
ain't
all
it
ain't
a
millionth
part
of
it
he
had
me
horsewhipped
horsewhipped
in
front
of
the
jail
like
a
nigger
with
all
the
town
looking
on
horsewhipped
do
you
understand
he
took
advantage
of
me
and
died
but
i'll
take
it
out
of
her
oh
don't
kill
her
don't
do
that
kill
who
said
anything
about
killing
i
would
kill
him
if
he
was
here
but
not
her
when
you
want
to
get
revenge
on
a
woman
you
don't
kill
her
bosh
you
go
for
her
looks
you
slit
her
nostrils
you
notch
her
ears
like
a
sow
by
god
that's
keep
your
opinion
to
yourself
it
will
be
safest
for
you
i'll
tie
her
to
the
bed
if
she
bleeds
to
death
is
that
my
fault
i'll
not
cry
if
she
does
my
friend
you'll
help
me
in
this
thing
for
my
sake
that's
why
you're
here
i
mightn't
be
able
alone
if
you
flinch
i'll
kill
you
do
you
understand
that
and
if
i
have
to
kill
you
i'll
kill
her
and
then
i
reckon
nobody'll
ever
know
much
about
who
done
this
business
well
if
it's
got
to
be
done
let's
get
at
it
the
quicker
the
better
i'm
all
in
a
shiver
do
it
now
and
company
there
look
here
i'll
get
suspicious
of
you
first
thing
you
know
no
we'll
wait
till
the
lights
are
out
there's
no
hurry
huck
felt
that
a
silence
was
going
to
ensue
a
thing
still
more
awful
than
any
amount
of
murderous
talk
so
he
held
his
breath
and
stepped
gingerly
back
planted
his
foot
carefully
and
firmly
after
balancing
one
legged
in
a
precarious
way
and
almost
toppling
over
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
he
took
another
step
back
with
the
same
elaboration
and
the
same
risks
then
another
and
another
and
a
twig
snapped
under
his
foot
his
breath
stopped
and
he
listened
there
was
no
sound
the
stillness
was
perfect
his
gratitude
was
measureless
now
he
turned
in
his
tracks
between
the
walls
of
sumach
bushes
turned
himself
as
carefully
as
if
he
were
a
ship
and
then
stepped
quickly
but
cautiously
along
when
he
emerged
at
the
quarry
he
felt
secure
and
so
he
picked
up
his
nimble
heels
and
flew
down
down
he
sped
till
he
reached
the
welshman's
he
banged
at
the
door
and
presently
the
heads
of
the
old
man
and
his
two
stalwart
sons
were
thrust
from
windows
what's
the
row
there
who's
banging
what
do
you
want
let
me
in
quick
i'll
tell
everything
why
who
are
you
huckleberry
finn
quick
let
me
in
huckleberry
finn
indeed
it
ain't
a
name
to
open
many
doors
i
judge
but
let
him
in
lads
and
let's
see
what's
the
trouble
please
don't
ever
tell
i
told
you
were
huck's
first
words
when
he
got
in
please
don't
i'd
be
killed
sure
but
the
widow's
been
good
friends
to
me
sometimes
and
i
want
to
tell
i
will
tell
if
you'll
promise
you
won't
ever
say
it
was
me
by
george
he
has
got
something
to
tell
or
he
wouldn't
act
so
exclaimed
the
old
man
out
with
it
and
nobody
here'll
ever
tell
lad
three
minutes
later
the
old
man
and
his
sons
well
armed
were
up
the
hill
and
just
entering
the
sumach
path
on
tiptoe
their
weapons
in
their
hands
huck
accompanied
them
no
further
he
hid
behind
a
great
bowlder
and
fell
to
listening
there
was
a
lagging
anxious
silence
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
an
explosion
of
firearms
and
a
cry
huck
waited
for
no
particulars
he
sprang
away
and
sped
down
the
hill
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
chapter
xxx
as
the
earliest
suspicion
of
dawn
appeared
on
sunday
morning
huck
came
groping
up
the
hill
and
rapped
gently
at
the
old
welshman's
door
the
inmates
were
asleep
but
it
was
a
sleep
that
was
set
on
a
hair
trigger
on
account
of
the
exciting
episode
of
the
night
a
call
came
from
a
window
who's
there
huck's
scared
voice
answered
in
a
low
tone
please
let
me
in
it's
only
huck
finn
it's
a
name
that
can
open
this
door
night
or
day
lad
and
welcome
these
were
strange
words
to
the
vagabond
boy's
ears
and
the
pleasantest
he
had
ever
heard
he
could
not
recollect
that
the
closing
word
had
ever
been
applied
in
his
case
before
the
door
was
quickly
unlocked
and
he
entered
huck
was
given
a
seat
and
the
old
man
and
his
brace
of
tall
sons
speedily
dressed
themselves
now
my
boy
i
hope
you're
good
and
hungry
because
breakfast
will
be
ready
as
soon
as
the
sun's
up
and
we'll
have
a
piping
hot
one
too
make
yourself
easy
about
that
i
and
the
boys
hoped
you'd
turn
up
and
stop
here
last
night
i
was
awful
scared
said
huck
and
i
run
i
took
out
when
the
pistols
went
off
and
i
didn't
stop
for
three
mile
i've
come
now
becuz
i
wanted
to
know
about
it
you
know
and
i
come
before
daylight
becuz
i
didn't
want
to
run
across
them
devils
even
if
they
was
dead
well
poor
chap
you
do
look
as
if
you'd
had
a
hard
night
of
it
but
there's
a
bed
here
for
you
when
you've
had
your
breakfast
no
they
ain't
dead
lad
we
are
sorry
enough
for
that
you
see
we
knew
right
where
to
put
our
hands
on
them
by
your
description
so
we
crept
along
on
tiptoe
till
we
got
within
fifteen
feet
of
them
dark
as
a
cellar
that
sumach
path
was
and
just
then
i
found
i
was
going
to
sneeze
it
was
the
meanest
kind
of
luck
i
tried
to
keep
it
back
but
no
use
twas
bound
to
come
and
it
did
come
i
was
in
the
lead
with
my
pistol
raised
and
when
the
sneeze
started
those
scoundrels
a
rustling
to
get
out
of
the
path
i
sung
out
fire
boys
and
blazed
away
at
the
place
where
the
rustling
was
so
did
the
boys
but
they
were
off
in
a
jiffy
those
villains
and
we
after
them
down
through
the
woods
i
judge
we
never
touched
them
they
fired
a
shot
apiece
as
they
started
but
their
bullets
whizzed
by
and
didn't
do
us
any
harm
as
soon
as
we
lost
the
sound
of
their
feet
we
quit
chasing
and
went
down
and
stirred
up
the
constables
they
got
a
posse
together
and
went
off
to
guard
the
river
bank
and
as
soon
as
it
is
light
the
sheriff
and
a
gang
are
going
to
beat
up
the
woods
my
boys
will
be
with
them
presently
i
wish
we
had
some
sort
of
description
of
those
rascals
twould
help
a
good
deal
but
you
couldn't
see
what
they
were
like
in
the
dark
lad
i
suppose
oh
yes
i
saw
them
downtown
and
follered
them
splendid
describe
them
describe
them
my
boy
one's
the
old
deaf
and
dumb
spaniard
that's
ben
around
here
once
or
twice
and
t'other's
a
mean
looking
ragged
that's
enough
lad
we
know
the
men
happened
on
them
in
the
woods
back
of
the
widow's
one
day
and
they
slunk
away
off
with
you
boys
and
tell
the
sheriff
get
your
breakfast
tomorrow
morning
the
welshman's
sons
departed
at
once
as
they
were
leaving
the
room
huck
sprang
up
and
exclaimed
oh
please
don't
tell
any
body
it
was
me
that
blowed
on
them
oh
please
all
right
if
you
say
it
huck
but
you
ought
to
have
the
credit
of
what
you
did
oh
no
no
please
don't
tell
when
the
young
men
were
gone
the
old
welshman
said
they
won't
tell
and
i
won't
but
why
don't
you
want
it
known
huck
would
not
explain
further
than
to
say
that
he
already
knew
too
much
about
one
of
those
men
and
would
not
have
the
man
know
that
he
knew
anything
against
him
for
the
whole
world
he
would
be
killed
for
knowing
it
sure
the
old
man
promised
secrecy
once
more
and
said
how
did
you
come
to
follow
these
fellows
lad
were
they
looking
suspicious
huck
was
silent
while
he
framed
a
duly
cautious
reply
then
he
said
well
you
see
i'm
a
kind
of
a
hard
lot
least
everybody
says
so
and
i
don't
see
nothing
agin
it
and
sometimes
i
can't
sleep
much
on
account
of
thinking
about
it
and
sort
of
trying
to
strike
out
a
new
way
of
doing
that
was
the
way
of
it
last
night
i
couldn't
sleep
and
so
i
come
along
upstreet
bout
midnight
a
turning
it
all
over
and
when
i
got
to
that
old
shackly
brick
store
by
the
temperance
tavern
i
backed
up
agin
the
wall
to
have
another
think
well
just
then
along
comes
these
two
chaps
slipping
along
close
by
me
with
something
under
their
arm
and
i
reckoned
they'd
stole
it
one
was
a
smoking
and
t'other
one
wanted
a
light
so
they
stopped
right
before
me
and
the
cigars
lit
up
their
faces
and
i
see
that
the
big
one
was
the
deaf
and
dumb
spaniard
by
his
white
whiskers
and
the
patch
on
his
eye
and
t'other
one
was
a
rusty
ragged
looking
devil
could
you
see
the
rags
by
the
light
of
the
cigars
this
staggered
huck
for
a
moment
then
he
said
well
i
don't
know
but
somehow
it
seems
as
if
i
did
then
they
went
on
and
you
follered
em
yes
that
was
it
i
wanted
to
see
what
was
up
they
sneaked
along
so
i
dogged
em
to
the
widder's
stile
and
stood
in
the
dark
and
heard
the
ragged
one
beg
for
the
widder
and
the
spaniard
swear
he'd
spile
her
looks
just
as
i
told
you
and
your
two
what
the
deaf
and
dumb
man
said
all
that
huck
had
made
another
terrible
mistake
he
was
trying
his
best
to
keep
the
old
man
from
getting
the
faintest
hint
of
who
the
spaniard
might
be
and
yet
his
tongue
seemed
determined
to
get
him
into
trouble
in
spite
of
all
he
could
do
he
made
several
efforts
to
creep
out
of
his
scrape
but
the
old
man's
eye
was
upon
him
and
he
made
blunder
after
blunder
presently
the
welshman
said
my
boy
don't
be
afraid
of
me
i
wouldn't
hurt
a
hair
of
your
head
for
all
the
world
no
i'd
protect
you
i'd
protect
you
this
spaniard
is
not
deaf
and
dumb
you've
let
that
slip
without
intending
it
you
can't
cover
that
up
now
you
know
something
about
that
spaniard
that
you
want
to
keep
dark
now
trust
me
tell
me
what
it
is
and
trust
me
i
won't
betray
you
huck
looked
into
the
old
man's
honest
eyes
a
moment
then
bent
over
and
whispered
in
his
ear
tain't
a
spaniard
it's
injun
joe
the
welshman
almost
jumped
out
of
his
chair
in
a
moment
he
said
it's
all
plain
enough
now
when
you
talked
about
notching
ears
and
slitting
noses
i
judged
that
that
was
your
own
embellishment
because
white
men
don't
take
that
sort
of
revenge
but
an
injun
that's
a
different
matter
altogether
during
breakfast
the
talk
went
on
and
in
the
course
of
it
the
old
man
said
that
the
last
thing
which
he
and
his
sons
had
done
before
going
to
bed
was
to
get
a
lantern
and
examine
the
stile
and
its
vicinity
for
marks
of
blood
they
found
none
but
captured
a
bulky
bundle
of
of
what
if
the
words
had
been
lightning
they
could
not
have
leaped
with
a
more
stunning
suddenness
from
huck's
blanched
lips
his
eyes
were
staring
wide
now
and
his
breath
suspended
waiting
for
the
answer
the
welshman
started
stared
in
return
three
seconds
five
seconds
ten
then
replied
of
burglar's
tools
why
what's
the
matter
with
you
huck
sank
back
panting
gently
but
deeply
unutterably
grateful
the
welshman
eyed
him
gravely
curiously
and
presently
said
yes
burglar's
tools
that
appears
to
relieve
you
a
good
deal
but
what
did
give
you
that
turn
what
were
you
expecting
we'd
found
huck
was
in
a
close
place
the
inquiring
eye
was
upon
him
he
would
have
given
anything
for
material
for
a
plausible
answer
nothing
suggested
itself
the
inquiring
eye
was
boring
deeper
and
deeper
a
senseless
reply
offered
there
was
no
time
to
weigh
it
so
at
a
venture
he
uttered
it
feebly
sunday
school
books
maybe
poor
huck
was
too
distressed
to
smile
but
the
old
man
laughed
loud
and
joyously
shook
up
the
details
of
his
anatomy
from
head
to
foot
and
ended
by
saying
that
such
a
laugh
was
money
in
a
man's
pocket
because
it
cut
down
the
doctor's
bill
like
everything
then
he
added
poor
old
chap
you're
white
and
jaded
you
ain't
well
a
bit
no
wonder
you're
a
little
flighty
and
off
your
balance
but
you'll
come
out
of
it
rest
and
sleep
will
fetch
you
out
all
right
i
hope
huck
was
irritated
to
think
he
had
been
such
a
goose
and
betrayed
such
a
suspicious
excitement
for
he
had
dropped
the
idea
that
the
parcel
brought
from
the
tavern
was
the
treasure
as
soon
as
he
had
heard
the
talk
at
the
widow's
stile
he
had
only
thought
it
was
not
the
treasure
however
he
had
not
known
that
it
wasn't
and
so
the
suggestion
of
a
captured
bundle
was
too
much
for
his
self
possession
but
on
the
whole
he
felt
glad
the
little
episode
had
happened
for
now
he
knew
beyond
all
question
that
that
bundle
was
not
the
bundle
and
so
his
mind
was
at
rest
and
exceedingly
comfortable
in
fact
everything
seemed
to
be
drifting
just
in
the
right
direction
now
the
treasure
must
be
still
in
no
the
men
would
be
captured
and
jailed
that
day
and
he
and
tom
could
seize
the
gold
that
night
without
any
trouble
or
any
fear
of
interruption
just
as
breakfast
was
completed
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
huck
jumped
for
a
hiding
place
for
he
had
no
mind
to
be
connected
even
remotely
with
the
late
event
the
welshman
admitted
several
ladies
and
gentlemen
among
them
the
widow
douglas
and
noticed
that
groups
of
citizens
were
climbing
up
the
hill
to
stare
at
the
stile
so
the
news
had
spread
the
welshman
had
to
tell
the
story
of
the
night
to
the
visitors
the
widow's
gratitude
for
her
preservation
was
outspoken
don't
say
a
word
about
it
madam
there's
another
that
you're
more
beholden
to
than
you
are
to
me
and
my
boys
maybe
but
he
don't
allow
me
to
tell
his
name
we
wouldn't
have
been
there
but
for
him
of
course
this
excited
a
curiosity
so
vast
that
it
almost
belittled
the
main
matter
but
the
welshman
allowed
it
to
eat
into
the
vitals
of
his
visitors
and
through
them
be
transmitted
to
the
whole
town
for
he
refused
to
part
with
his
secret
when
all
else
had
been
learned
the
widow
said
i
went
to
sleep
reading
in
bed
and
slept
straight
through
all
that
noise
why
didn't
you
come
and
wake
me
we
judged
it
warn't
worth
while
those
fellows
warn't
likely
to
come
again
they
hadn't
any
tools
left
to
work
with
and
what
was
the
use
of
waking
you
up
and
scaring
you
to
death
my
three
negro
men
stood
guard
at
your
house
all
the
rest
of
the
night
they've
just
come
back
more
visitors
came
and
the
story
had
to
be
told
and
retold
for
a
couple
of
hours
more
there
was
no
sabbath
school
during
day
school
vacation
but
everybody
was
early
at
church
the
stirring
event
was
well
canvassed
news
came
that
not
a
sign
of
the
two
villains
had
been
yet
discovered
when
the
sermon
was
finished
judge
thatcher's
wife
dropped
alongside
of
mrs
harper
as
she
moved
down
the
aisle
with
the
crowd
and
said
is
my
becky
going
to
sleep
all
day
i
just
expected
she
would
be
tired
to
death
your
becky
yes
with
a
startled
look
didn't
she
stay
with
you
last
night
why
no
mrs
thatcher
turned
pale
and
sank
into
a
pew
just
as
aunt
polly
talking
briskly
with
a
friend
passed
by
aunt
polly
said
goodmorning
mrs
thatcher
goodmorning
mrs
harper
i've
got
a
boy
that's
turned
up
missing
i
reckon
my
tom
stayed
at
your
house
last
night
one
of
you
and
now
he's
afraid
to
come
to
church
i've
got
to
settle
with
him
mrs
thatcher
shook
her
head
feebly
and
turned
paler
than
ever
he
didn't
stay
with
us
said
mrs
harper
beginning
to
look
uneasy
a
marked
anxiety
came
into
aunt
polly's
face
joe
harper
have
you
seen
my
tom
this
morning
no'm
when
did
you
see
him
last
joe
tried
to
remember
but
was
not
sure
he
could
say
the
people
had
stopped
moving
out
of
church
whispers
passed
along
and
a
boding
uneasiness
took
possession
of
every
countenance
children
were
anxiously
questioned
and
young
teachers
they
all
said
they
had
not
noticed
whether
tom
and
becky
were
on
board
the
ferryboat
on
the
homeward
trip
it
was
dark
no
one
thought
of
inquiring
if
any
one
was
missing
one
young
man
finally
blurted
out
his
fear
that
they
were
still
in
the
cave
mrs
thatcher
swooned
away
aunt
polly
fell
to
crying
and
wringing
her
hands
the
alarm
swept
from
lip
to
lip
from
group
to
group
from
street
to
street
and
within
five
minutes
the
bells
were
wildly
clanging
and
the
whole
town
was
up
the
cardiff
hill
episode
sank
into
instant
insignificance
the
burglars
were
forgotten
horses
were
saddled
skiffs
were
manned
the
ferryboat
ordered
out
and
before
the
horror
was
half
an
hour
old
two
hundred
men
were
pouring
down
highroad
and
river
toward
the
cave
all
the
long
afternoon
the
village
seemed
empty
and
dead
many
women
visited
aunt
polly
and
mrs
thatcher
and
tried
to
comfort
them
they
cried
with
them
too
and
that
was
still
better
than
words
all
the
tedious
night
the
town
waited
for
news
but
when
the
morning
dawned
at
last
all
the
word
that
came
was
send
more
candles
and
send
food
mrs
thatcher
was
almost
crazed
and
aunt
polly
also
judge
thatcher
sent
messages
of
hope
and
encouragement
from
the
cave
but
they
conveyed
no
real
cheer
the
old
welshman
came
home
toward
daylight
spattered
with
candle
grease
smeared
with
clay
and
almost
worn
out
he
found
huck
still
in
the
bed
that
had
been
provided
for
him
and
delirious
with
fever
the
physicians
were
all
at
the
cave
so
the
widow
douglas
came
and
took
charge
of
the
patient
she
said
she
would
do
her
best
by
him
because
whether
he
was
good
bad
or
indifferent
he
was
the
lord's
and
nothing
that
was
the
lord's
was
a
thing
to
be
neglected
the
welshman
said
huck
had
good
spots
in
him
and
the
widow
said
you
can
depend
on
it
that's
the
lord's
mark
he
don't
leave
it
off
he
never
does
puts
it
somewhere
on
every
creature
that
comes
from
his
hands
early
in
the
forenoon
parties
of
jaded
men
began
to
straggle
into
the
village
but
the
strongest
of
the
citizens
continued
searching
all
the
news
that
could
be
gained
was
that
remotenesses
of
the
cavern
were
being
ransacked
that
had
never
been
visited
before
that
every
corner
and
crevice
was
going
to
be
thoroughly
searched
that
wherever
one
wandered
through
the
maze
of
passages
lights
were
to
be
seen
flitting
hither
and
thither
in
the
distance
and
shoutings
and
pistol
shots
sent
their
hollow
reverberations
to
the
ear
down
the
sombre
aisles
in
one
place
far
from
the
section
usually
traversed
by
tourists
the
names
becky
tom
had
been
found
traced
upon
the
rocky
wall
with
candle
smoke
and
near
at
hand
a
grease
soiled
bit
of
ribbon
mrs
thatcher
recognized
the
ribbon
and
cried
over
it
she
said
it
was
the
last
relic
she
should
ever
have
of
her
child
and
that
no
other
memorial
of
her
could
ever
be
so
precious
because
this
one
parted
latest
from
the
living
body
before
the
awful
death
came
some
said
that
now
and
then
in
the
cave
a
far
away
speck
of
light
would
glimmer
and
then
a
glorious
shout
would
burst
forth
and
a
score
of
men
go
trooping
down
the
echoing
aisle
and
then
a
sickening
disappointment
always
followed
the
children
were
not
there
it
was
only
a
searcher's
light
three
dreadful
days
and
nights
dragged
their
tedious
hours
along
and
the
village
sank
into
a
hopeless
stupor
no
one
had
heart
for
anything
the
accidental
discovery
just
made
that
the
proprietor
of
the
temperance
tavern
kept
liquor
on
his
premises
scarcely
fluttered
the
public
pulse
tremendous
as
the
fact
was
in
a
lucid
interval
huck
feebly
led
up
to
the
subject
of
taverns
and
finally
asked
dimly
dreading
the
worst
if
anything
had
been
discovered
at
the
temperance
tavern
since
he
had
been
ill
yes
said
the
widow
huck
started
up
in
bed
wildeyed
what
what
was
it
liquor
and
the
place
has
been
shut
up
lie
down
child
what
a
turn
you
did
give
me
only
tell
me
just
one
thing
only
just
one
please
was
it
tom
sawyer
that
found
it
the
widow
burst
into
tears
hush
hush
child
hush
i've
told
you
before
you
must
not
talk
you
are
very
very
sick
then
nothing
but
liquor
had
been
found
there
would
have
been
a
great
powwow
if
it
had
been
the
gold
so
the
treasure
was
gone
forever
gone
forever
but
what
could
she
be
crying
about
curious
that
she
should
cry
these
thoughts
worked
their
dim
way
through
huck's
mind
and
under
the
weariness
they
gave
him
he
fell
asleep
the
widow
said
to
herself
there
he's
asleep
poor
wreck
tom
sawyer
find
it
pity
but
somebody
could
find
tom
sawyer
ah
there
ain't
many
left
now
that's
got
hope
enough
or
strength
enough
either
to
go
on
searching
chapter
xxxi
now
to
return
to
tom
and
becky's
share
in
the
picnic
they
tripped
along
the
murky
aisles
with
the
rest
of
the
company
visiting
the
familiar
wonders
of
the
cave
wonders
dubbed
with
rather
over
descriptive
names
such
as
the
drawing
room
the
cathedral
aladdin's
palace
and
so
on
presently
the
hide
and
seek
frolicking
began
and
tom
and
becky
engaged
in
it
with
zeal
until
the
exertion
began
to
grow
a
trifle
wearisome
then
they
wandered
down
a
sinuous
avenue
holding
their
candles
aloft
and
reading
the
tangled
webwork
of
names
dates
postoffice
addresses
and
mottoes
with
which
the
rocky
walls
had
been
frescoed
in
candle
smoke
still
drifting
along
and
talking
they
scarcely
noticed
that
they
were
now
in
a
part
of
the
cave
whose
walls
were
not
frescoed
they
smoked
their
own
names
under
an
overhanging
shelf
and
moved
on
presently
they
came
to
a
place
where
a
little
stream
of
water
trickling
over
a
ledge
and
carrying
a
limestone
sediment
with
it
had
in
the
slow
dragging
ages
formed
a
laced
and
ruffled
niagara
in
gleaming
and
imperishable
stone
tom
squeezed
his
small
body
behind
it
in
order
to
illuminate
it
for
becky's
gratification
he
found
that
it
curtained
a
sort
of
steep
natural
stairway
which
was
enclosed
between
narrow
walls
and
at
once
the
ambition
to
be
a
discoverer
seized
him
becky
responded
to
his
call
and
they
made
a
smoke
mark
for
future
guidance
and
started
upon
their
quest
they
wound
this
way
and
that
far
down
into
the
secret
depths
of
the
cave
made
another
mark
and
branched
off
in
search
of
novelties
to
tell
the
upper
world
about
in
one
place
they
found
a
spacious
cavern
from
whose
ceiling
depended
a
multitude
of
shining
stalactites
of
the
length
and
circumference
of
a
man's
leg
they
walked
all
about
it
wondering
and
admiring
and
presently
left
it
by
one
of
the
numerous
passages
that
opened
into
it
this
shortly
brought
them
to
a
bewitching
spring
whose
basin
was
incrusted
with
a
frostwork
of
glittering
crystals
it
was
in
the
midst
of
a
cavern
whose
walls
were
supported
by
many
fantastic
pillars
which
had
been
formed
by
the
joining
of
great
stalactites
and
stalagmites
together
the
result
of
the
ceaseless
water
drip
of
centuries
under
the
roof
vast
knots
of
bats
had
packed
themselves
together
thousands
in
a
bunch
the
lights
disturbed
the
creatures
and
they
came
flocking
down
by
hundreds
squeaking
and
darting
furiously
at
the
candles
tom
knew
their
ways
and
the
danger
of
this
sort
of
conduct
he
seized
becky's
hand
and
hurried
her
into
the
first
corridor
that
offered
and
none
too
soon
for
a
bat
struck
becky's
light
out
with
its
wing
while
she
was
passing
out
of
the
cavern
the
bats
chased
the
children
a
good
distance
but
the
fugitives
plunged
into
every
new
passage
that
offered
and
at
last
got
rid
of
the
perilous
things
tom
found
a
subterranean
lake
shortly
which
stretched
its
dim
length
away
until
its
shape
was
lost
in
the
shadows
he
wanted
to
explore
its
borders
but
concluded
that
it
would
be
best
to
sit
down
and
rest
awhile
first
now
for
the
first
time
the
deep
stillness
of
the
place
laid
a
clammy
hand
upon
the
spirits
of
the
children
becky
said
why
i
didn't
notice
but
it
seems
ever
so
long
since
i
heard
any
of
the
others
come
to
think
becky
we
are
away
down
below
them
and
i
don't
know
how
far
away
north
or
south
or
east
or
whichever
it
is
we
couldn't
hear
them
here
becky
grew
apprehensive
i
wonder
how
long
we've
been
down
here
tom
we
better
start
back
yes
i
reckon
we
better
p'raps
we
better
can
you
find
the
way
tom
it's
all
a
mixed
up
crookedness
to
me
i
reckon
i
could
find
it
but
then
the
bats
if
they
put
our
candles
out
it
will
be
an
awful
fix
let's
try
some
other
way
so
as
not
to
go
through
there
well
but
i
hope
we
won't
get
lost
it
would
be
so
awful
and
the
girl
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
the
dreadful
possibilities
they
started
through
a
corridor
and
traversed
it
in
silence
a
long
way
glancing
at
each
new
opening
to
see
if
there
was
anything
familiar
about
the
look
of
it
but
they
were
all
strange
every
time
tom
made
an
examination
becky
would
watch
his
face
for
an
encouraging
sign
and
he
would
say
cheerily
oh
it's
all
right
this
ain't
the
one
but
we'll
come
to
it
right
away
but
he
felt
less
and
less
hopeful
with
each
failure
and
presently
began
to
turn
off
into
diverging
avenues
at
sheer
random
in
desperate
hope
of
finding
the
one
that
was
wanted
he
still
said
it
was
all
right
but
there
was
such
a
leaden
dread
at
his
heart
that
the
words
had
lost
their
ring
and
sounded
just
as
if
he
had
said
all
is
lost
becky
clung
to
his
side
in
an
anguish
of
fear
and
tried
hard
to
keep
back
the
tears
but
they
would
come
at
last
she
said
oh
tom
never
mind
the
bats
let's
go
back
that
way
we
seem
to
get
worse
and
worse
off
all
the
time
listen
said
he
profound
silence
silence
so
deep
that
even
their
breathings
were
conspicuous
in
the
hush
tom
shouted
the
call
went
echoing
down
the
empty
aisles
and
died
out
in
the
distance
in
a
faint
sound
that
resembled
a
ripple
of
mocking
laughter
oh
don't
do
it
again
tom
it
is
too
horrid
said
becky
it
is
horrid
but
i
better
becky
they
might
hear
us
you
know
and
he
shouted
again
the
might
was
even
a
chillier
horror
than
the
ghostly
laughter
it
so
confessed
a
perishing
hope
the
children
stood
still
and
listened
but
there
was
no
result
tom
turned
upon
the
back
track
at
once
and
hurried
his
steps
it
was
but
a
little
while
before
a
certain
indecision
in
his
manner
revealed
another
fearful
fact
to
becky
he
could
not
find
his
way
back
oh
tom
you
didn't
make
any
marks
becky
i
was
such
a
fool
such
a
fool
i
never
thought
we
might
want
to
come
back
no
i
can't
find
the
way
it's
all
mixed
up
tom
tom
we're
lost
we're
lost
we
never
can
get
out
of
this
awful
place
oh
why
did
we
ever
leave
the
others
she
sank
to
the
ground
and
burst
into
such
a
frenzy
of
crying
that
tom
was
appalled
with
the
idea
that
she
might
die
or
lose
her
reason
he
sat
down
by
her
and
put
his
arms
around
her
she
buried
her
face
in
his
bosom
she
clung
to
him
she
poured
out
her
terrors
her
unavailing
regrets
and
the
far
echoes
turned
them
all
to
jeering
laughter
tom
begged
her
to
pluck
up
hope
again
and
she
said
she
could
not
he
fell
to
blaming
and
abusing
himself
for
getting
her
into
this
miserable
situation
this
had
a
better
effect
she
said
she
would
try
to
hope
again
she
would
get
up
and
follow
wherever
he
might
lead
if
only
he
would
not
talk
like
that
any
more
for
he
was
no
more
to
blame
than
she
she
said
so
they
moved
on
again
aimlessly
simply
at
random
all
they
could
do
was
to
move
keep
moving
for
a
little
while
hope
made
a
show
of
reviving
not
with
any
reason
to
back
it
but
only
because
it
is
its
nature
to
revive
when
the
spring
has
not
been
taken
out
of
it
by
age
and
familiarity
with
failure
by
and
by
tom
took
becky's
candle
and
blew
it
out
this
economy
meant
so
much
words
were
not
needed
becky
understood
and
her
hope
died
again
she
knew
that
tom
had
a
whole
candle
and
three
or
four
pieces
in
his
pockets
yet
he
must
economize
by
and
by
fatigue
began
to
assert
its
claims
the
children
tried
to
pay
attention
for
it
was
dreadful
to
think
of
sitting
down
when
time
was
grown
to
be
so
precious
moving
in
some
direction
in
any
direction
was
at
least
progress
and
might
bear
fruit
but
to
sit
down
was
to
invite
death
and
shorten
its
pursuit
at
last
becky's
frail
limbs
refused
to
carry
her
farther
she
sat
down
tom
rested
with
her
and
they
talked
of
home
and
the
friends
there
and
the
comfortable
beds
and
above
all
the
light
becky
cried
and
tom
tried
to
think
of
some
way
of
comforting
her
but
all
his
encouragements
were
grown
thread
bare
with
use
and
sounded
like
sarcasms
fatigue
bore
so
heavily
upon
becky
that
she
drowsed
off
to
sleep
tom
was
grateful
he
sat
looking
into
her
drawn
face
and
saw
it
grow
smooth
and
natural
under
the
influence
of
pleasant
dreams
and
by
and
by
a
smile
dawned
and
rested
there
the
peaceful
face
reflected
somewhat
of
peace
and
healing
into
his
own
spirit
and
his
thoughts
wandered
away
to
bygone
times
and
dreamy
memories
while
he
was
deep
in
his
musings
becky
woke
up
with
a
breezy
little
laugh
but
it
was
stricken
dead
upon
her
lips
and
a
groan
followed
it
oh
how
could
i
sleep
i
wish
i
never
never
had
waked
no
no
i
don't
tom
don't
look
so
i
won't
say
it
again
i'm
glad
you've
slept
becky
you'll
feel
rested
now
and
we'll
find
the
way
out
we
can
try
tom
but
i've
seen
such
a
beautiful
country
in
my
dream
i
reckon
we
are
going
there
maybe
not
maybe
not
cheer
up
becky
and
let's
go
on
trying
they
rose
up
and
wandered
along
hand
in
hand
and
hopeless
they
tried
to
estimate
how
long
they
had
been
in
the
cave
but
all
they
knew
was
that
it
seemed
days
and
weeks
and
yet
it
was
plain
that
this
could
not
be
for
their
candles
were
not
gone
yet
a
long
time
after
this
they
could
not
tell
how
long
tom
said
they
must
go
softly
and
listen
for
dripping
water
they
must
find
a
spring
they
found
one
presently
and
tom
said
it
was
time
to
rest
again
both
were
cruelly
tired
yet
becky
said
she
thought
she
could
go
a
little
farther
she
was
surprised
to
hear
tom
dissent
she
could
not
understand
it
they
sat
down
and
tom
fastened
his
candle
to
the
wall
in
front
of
them
with
some
clay
thought
was
soon
busy
nothing
was
said
for
some
time
then
becky
broke
the
silence
tom
i
am
so
hungry
tom
took
something
out
of
his
pocket
do
you
remember
this
said
he
becky
almost
smiled
it's
our
wedding
cake
tom
yes
i
wish
it
was
as
big
as
a
barrel
for
it's
all
we've
got
i
saved
it
from
the
picnic
for
us
to
dream
on
tom
the
way
grownup
people
do
with
wedding
cake
but
it'll
be
our
she
dropped
the
sentence
where
it
was
tom
divided
the
cake
and
becky
ate
with
good
appetite
while
tom
nibbled
at
his
moiety
there
was
abundance
of
cold
water
to
finish
the
feast
with
by
and
by
becky
suggested
that
they
move
on
again
tom
was
silent
a
moment
then
he
said
becky
can
you
bear
it
if
i
tell
you
something
becky's
face
paled
but
she
thought
she
could
well
then
becky
we
must
stay
here
where
there's
water
to
drink
that
little
piece
is
our
last
candle
becky
gave
loose
to
tears
and
wailings
tom
did
what
he
could
to
comfort
her
but
with
little
effect
at
length
becky
said
tom
well
becky
they'll
miss
us
and
hunt
for
us
yes
they
will
certainly
they
will
maybe
they're
hunting
for
us
now
tom
why
i
reckon
maybe
they
are
i
hope
they
are
when
would
they
miss
us
tom
when
they
get
back
to
the
boat
i
reckon
tom
it
might
be
dark
then
would
they
notice
we
hadn't
come
i
don't
know
but
anyway
your
mother
would
miss
you
as
soon
as
they
got
home
a
frightened
look
in
becky's
face
brought
tom
to
his
senses
and
he
saw
that
he
had
made
a
blunder
becky
was
not
to
have
gone
home
that
night
the
children
became
silent
and
thoughtful
in
a
moment
a
new
burst
of
grief
from
becky
showed
tom
that
the
thing
in
his
mind
had
struck
hers
also
that
the
sabbath
morning
might
be
half
spent
before
mrs
thatcher
discovered
that
becky
was
not
at
mrs
harper's
the
children
fastened
their
eyes
upon
their
bit
of
candle
and
watched
it
melt
slowly
and
pitilessly
away
saw
the
half
inch
of
wick
stand
alone
at
last
saw
the
feeble
flame
rise
and
fall
climb
the
thin
column
of
smoke
linger
at
its
top
a
moment
and
then
the
horror
of
utter
darkness
reigned
how
long
afterward
it
was
that
becky
came
to
a
slow
consciousness
that
she
was
crying
in
tom's
arms
neither
could
tell
all
that
they
knew
was
that
after
what
seemed
a
mighty
stretch
of
time
both
awoke
out
of
a
dead
stupor
of
sleep
and
resumed
their
miseries
once
more
tom
said
it
might
be
sunday
now
maybe
monday
he
tried
to
get
becky
to
talk
but
her
sorrows
were
too
oppressive
all
her
hopes
were
gone
tom
said
that
they
must
have
been
missed
long
ago
and
no
doubt
the
search
was
going
on
he
would
shout
and
maybe
some
one
would
come
he
tried
it
but
in
the
darkness
the
distant
echoes
sounded
so
hideously
that
he
tried
it
no
more
the
hours
wasted
away
and
hunger
came
to
torment
the
captives
again
a
portion
of
tom's
half
of
the
cake
was
left
they
divided
and
ate
it
but
they
seemed
hungrier
than
before
the
poor
morsel
of
food
only
whetted
desire
by
and
by
tom
said
sh
did
you
hear
that
both
held
their
breath
and
listened
there
was
a
sound
like
the
faintest
far
off
shout
instantly
tom
answered
it
and
leading
becky
by
the
hand
started
groping
down
the
corridor
in
its
direction
presently
he
listened
again
again
the
sound
was
heard
and
apparently
a
little
nearer
it's
them
said
tom
they're
coming
come
along
becky
we're
all
right
now
the
joy
of
the
prisoners
was
almost
overwhelming
their
speed
was
slow
however
because
pitfalls
were
somewhat
common
and
had
to
be
guarded
against
they
shortly
came
to
one
and
had
to
stop
it
might
be
three
feet
deep
it
might
be
a
hundred
there
was
no
passing
it
at
any
rate
tom
got
down
on
his
breast
and
reached
as
far
down
as
he
could
no
bottom
they
must
stay
there
and
wait
until
the
searchers
came
they
listened
evidently
the
distant
shoutings
were
growing
more
distant
a
moment
or
two
more
and
they
had
gone
altogether
the
heart
sinking
misery
of
it
tom
whooped
until
he
was
hoarse
but
it
was
of
no
use
he
talked
hopefully
to
becky
but
an
age
of
anxious
waiting
passed
and
no
sounds
came
again
the
children
groped
their
way
back
to
the
spring
the
weary
time
dragged
on
they
slept
again
and
awoke
famished
and
woe
stricken
tom
believed
it
must
be
tuesday
by
this
time
now
an
idea
struck
him
there
were
some
side
passages
near
at
hand
it
would
be
better
to
explore
some
of
these
than
bear
the
weight
of
the
heavy
time
in
idleness
he
took
a
kite
line
from
his
pocket
tied
it
to
a
projection
and
he
and
becky
started
tom
in
the
lead
unwinding
the
line
as
he
groped
along
at
the
end
of
twenty
steps
the
corridor
ended
in
a
jumping
off
place
tom
got
down
on
his
knees
and
felt
below
and
then
as
far
around
the
corner
as
he
could
reach
with
his
hands
conveniently
he
made
an
effort
to
stretch
yet
a
little
farther
to
the
right
and
at
that
moment
not
twenty
yards
away
a
human
hand
holding
a
candle
appeared
from
behind
a
rock
tom
lifted
up
a
glorious
shout
and
instantly
that
hand
was
followed
by
the
body
it
belonged
to
injun
joe's
tom
was
paralyzed
he
could
not
move
he
was
vastly
gratified
the
next
moment
to
see
the
spaniard
take
to
his
heels
and
get
himself
out
of
sight
tom
wondered
that
joe
had
not
recognized
his
voice
and
come
over
and
killed
him
for
testifying
in
court
but
the
echoes
must
have
disguised
the
voice
without
doubt
that
was
it
he
reasoned
tom's
fright
weakened
every
muscle
in
his
body
he
said
to
himself
that
if
he
had
strength
enough
to
get
back
to
the
spring
he
would
stay
there
and
nothing
should
tempt
him
to
run
the
risk
of
meeting
injun
joe
again
he
was
careful
to
keep
from
becky
what
it
was
he
had
seen
he
told
her
he
had
only
shouted
for
luck
but
hunger
and
wretchedness
rise
superior
to
fears
in
the
long
run
another
tedious
wait
at
the
spring
and
another
long
sleep
brought
changes
the
children
awoke
tortured
with
a
raging
hunger
tom
believed
that
it
must
be
wednesday
or
thursday
or
even
friday
or
saturday
now
and
that
the
search
had
been
given
over
he
proposed
to
explore
another
passage
he
felt
willing
to
risk
injun
joe
and
all
other
terrors
but
becky
was
very
weak
she
had
sunk
into
a
dreary
apathy
and
would
not
be
roused
she
said
she
would
wait
now
where
she
was
and
die
it
would
not
be
long
she
told
tom
to
go
with
the
kite
line
and
explore
if
he
chose
but
she
implored
him
to
come
back
every
little
while
and
speak
to
her
and
she
made
him
promise
that
when
the
awful
time
came
he
would
stay
by
her
and
hold
her
hand
until
all
was
over
tom
kissed
her
with
a
choking
sensation
in
his
throat
and
made
a
show
of
being
confident
of
finding
the
searchers
or
an
escape
from
the
cave
then
he
took
the
kite
line
in
his
hand
and
went
groping
down
one
of
the
passages
on
his
hands
and
knees
distressed
with
hunger
and
sick
with
bodings
of
coming
doom
chapter
xxxii
tuesday
afternoon
came
and
waned
to
the
twilight
the
village
of
st
petersburg
still
mourned
the
lost
children
had
not
been
found
public
prayers
had
been
offered
up
for
them
and
many
and
many
a
private
prayer
that
had
the
petitioner's
whole
heart
in
it
but
still
no
good
news
came
from
the
cave
the
majority
of
the
searchers
had
given
up
the
quest
and
gone
back
to
their
daily
avocations
saying
that
it
was
plain
the
children
could
never
be
found
mrs
thatcher
was
very
ill
and
a
great
part
of
the
time
delirious
people
said
it
was
heartbreaking
to
hear
her
call
her
child
and
raise
her
head
and
listen
a
whole
minute
at
a
time
then
lay
it
wearily
down
again
with
a
moan
aunt
polly
had
drooped
into
a
settled
melancholy
and
her
gray
hair
had
grown
almost
white
the
village
went
to
its
rest
on
tuesday
night
sad
and
forlorn
away
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
wild
peal
burst
from
the
village
bells
and
in
a
moment
the
streets
were
swarming
with
frantic
half
clad
people
who
shouted
turn
out
turn
out
they're
found
they're
found
tin
pans
and
horns
were
added
to
the
din
the
population
massed
itself
and
moved
toward
the
river
met
the
children
coming
in
an
open
carriage
drawn
by
shouting
citizens
thronged
around
it
joined
its
homeward
march
and
swept
magnificently
up
the
main
street
roaring
huzzah
after
huzzah
the
village
was
illuminated
nobody
went
to
bed
again
it
was
the
greatest
night
the
little
town
had
ever
seen
during
the
first
half
hour
a
procession
of
villagers
filed
through
judge
thatcher's
house
seized
the
saved
ones
and
kissed
them
squeezed
mrs
thatcher's
hand
tried
to
speak
but
couldn't
and
drifted
out
raining
tears
all
over
the
place
aunt
polly's
happiness
was
complete
and
mrs
thatcher's
nearly
so
it
would
be
complete
however
as
soon
as
the
messenger
dispatched
with
the
great
news
to
the
cave
should
get
the
word
to
her
husband
tom
lay
upon
a
sofa
with
an
eager
auditory
about
him
and
told
the
history
of
the
wonderful
adventure
putting
in
many
striking
additions
to
adorn
it
withal
and
closed
with
a
description
of
how
he
left
becky
and
went
on
an
exploring
expedition
how
he
followed
two
avenues
as
far
as
his
kite
line
would
reach
how
he
followed
a
third
to
the
fullest
stretch
of
the
kite
line
and
was
about
to
turn
back
when
he
glimpsed
a
far
off
speck
that
looked
like
daylight
dropped
the
line
and
groped
toward
it
pushed
his
head
and
shoulders
through
a
small
hole
and
saw
the
broad
mississippi
rolling
by
and
if
it
had
only
happened
to
be
night
he
would
not
have
seen
that
speck
of
daylight
and
would
not
have
explored
that
passage
any
more
he
told
how
he
went
back
for
becky
and
broke
the
good
news
and
she
told
him
not
to
fret
her
with
such
stuff
for
she
was
tired
and
knew
she
was
going
to
die
and
wanted
to
he
described
how
he
labored
with
her
and
convinced
her
and
how
she
almost
died
for
joy
when
she
had
groped
to
where
she
actually
saw
the
blue
speck
of
daylight
how
he
pushed
his
way
out
at
the
hole
and
then
helped
her
out
how
they
sat
there
and
cried
for
gladness
how
some
men
came
along
in
a
skiff
and
tom
hailed
them
and
told
them
their
situation
and
their
famished
condition
how
the
men
didn't
believe
the
wild
tale
at
first
because
said
they
you
are
five
miles
down
the
river
below
the
valley
the
cave
is
in
then
took
them
aboard
rowed
to
a
house
gave
them
supper
made
them
rest
till
two
or
three
hours
after
dark
and
then
brought
them
home
before
day
dawn
judge
thatcher
and
the
handful
of
searchers
with
him
were
tracked
out
in
the
cave
by
the
twine
clews
they
had
strung
behind
them
and
informed
of
the
great
news
three
days
and
nights
of
toil
and
hunger
in
the
cave
were
not
to
be
shaken
off
at
once
as
tom
and
becky
soon
discovered
they
were
bedridden
all
of
wednesday
and
thursday
and
seemed
to
grow
more
and
more
tired
and
worn
all
the
time
tom
got
about
a
little
on
thursday
was
downtown
friday
and
nearly
as
whole
as
ever
saturday
but
becky
did
not
leave
her
room
until
sunday
and
then
she
looked
as
if
she
had
passed
through
a
wasting
illness
tom
learned
of
huck's
sickness
and
went
to
see
him
on
friday
but
could
not
be
admitted
to
the
bedroom
neither
could
he
on
saturday
or
sunday
he
was
admitted
daily
after
that
but
was
warned
to
keep
still
about
his
adventure
and
introduce
no
exciting
topic
the
widow
douglas
stayed
by
to
see
that
he
obeyed
at
home
tom
learned
of
the
cardiff
hill
event
also
that
the
ragged
man's
body
had
eventually
been
found
in
the
river
near
the
ferry
landing
he
had
been
drowned
while
trying
to
escape
perhaps
about
a
fortnight
after
tom's
rescue
from
the
cave
he
started
off
to
visit
huck
who
had
grown
plenty
strong
enough
now
to
hear
exciting
talk
and
tom
had
some
that
would
interest
him
he
thought
judge
thatcher's
house
was
on
tom's
way
and
he
stopped
to
see
becky
the
judge
and
some
friends
set
tom
to
talking
and
some
one
asked
him
ironically
if
he
wouldn't
like
to
go
to
the
cave
again
tom
said
he
thought
he
wouldn't
mind
it
the
judge
said
well
there
are
others
just
like
you
tom
i've
not
the
least
doubt
but
we
have
taken
care
of
that
nobody
will
get
lost
in
that
cave
any
more
why
because
i
had
its
big
door
sheathed
with
boiler
iron
two
weeks
ago
and
triple
locked
and
i've
got
the
keys
tom
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
what's
the
matter
boy
here
run
somebody
fetch
a
glass
of
water
the
water
was
brought
and
thrown
into
tom's
face
ah
now
you're
all
right
what
was
the
matter
with
you
tom
oh
judge
injun
joe's
in
the
cave
chapter
xxxiii
within
a
few
minutes
the
news
had
spread
and
a
dozen
skiff
loads
of
men
were
on
their
way
to
mcdougal's
cave
and
the
ferryboat
well
filled
with
passengers
soon
followed
tom
sawyer
was
in
the
skiff
that
bore
judge
thatcher
when
the
cave
door
was
unlocked
a
sorrowful
sight
presented
itself
in
the
dim
twilight
of
the
place
injun
joe
lay
stretched
upon
the
ground
dead
with
his
face
close
to
the
crack
of
the
door
as
if
his
longing
eyes
had
been
fixed
to
the
latest
moment
upon
the
light
and
the
cheer
of
the
free
world
outside
tom
was
touched
for
he
knew
by
his
own
experience
how
this
wretch
had
suffered
his
pity
was
moved
but
nevertheless
he
felt
an
abounding
sense
of
relief
and
security
now
which
revealed
to
him
in
a
degree
which
he
had
not
fully
appreciated
before
how
vast
a
weight
of
dread
had
been
lying
upon
him
since
the
day
he
lifted
his
voice
against
this
bloody
minded
outcast
injun
joe's
bowie
knife
lay
close
by
its
blade
broken
in
two
the
great
foundation
beam
of
the
door
had
been
chipped
and
hacked
through
with
tedious
labor
useless
labor
too
it
was
for
the
native
rock
formed
a
sill
outside
it
and
upon
that
stubborn
material
the
knife
had
wrought
no
effect
the
only
damage
done
was
to
the
knife
itself
but
if
there
had
been
no
stony
obstruction
there
the
labor
would
have
been
useless
still
for
if
the
beam
had
been
wholly
cut
away
injun
joe
could
not
have
squeezed
his
body
under
the
door
and
he
knew
it
so
he
had
only
hacked
that
place
in
order
to
be
doing
something
in
order
to
pass
the
weary
time
in
order
to
employ
his
tortured
faculties
ordinarily
one
could
find
half
a
dozen
bits
of
candle
stuck
around
in
the
crevices
of
this
vestibule
left
there
by
tourists
but
there
were
none
now
the
prisoner
had
searched
them
out
and
eaten
them
he
had
also
contrived
to
catch
a
few
bats
and
these
also
he
had
eaten
leaving
only
their
claws
the
poor
unfortunate
had
starved
to
death
in
one
place
near
at
hand
a
stalagmite
had
been
slowly
growing
up
from
the
ground
for
ages
builded
by
the
water
drip
from
a
stalactite
overhead
the
captive
had
broken
off
the
stalagmite
and
upon
the
stump
had
placed
a
stone
wherein
he
had
scooped
a
shallow
hollow
to
catch
the
precious
drop
that
fell
once
in
every
three
minutes
with
the
dreary
regularity
of
a
clock
tick
a
dessertspoonful
once
in
four
and
twenty
hours
that
drop
was
falling
when
the
pyramids
were
new
when
troy
fell
when
the
foundations
of
rome
were
laid
when
christ
was
crucified
when
the
conqueror
created
the
british
empire
when
columbus
sailed
when
the
massacre
at
lexington
was
news
it
is
falling
now
it
will
still
be
falling
when
all
these
things
shall
have
sunk
down
the
afternoon
of
history
and
the
twilight
of
tradition
and
been
swallowed
up
in
the
thick
night
of
oblivion
has
everything
a
purpose
and
a
mission
did
this
drop
fall
patiently
during
five
thousand
years
to
be
ready
for
this
flitting
human
insect's
need
and
has
it
another
important
object
to
accomplish
ten
thousand
years
to
come
no
matter
it
is
many
and
many
a
year
since
the
hapless
half
breed
scooped
out
the
stone
to
catch
the
priceless
drops
but
to
this
day
the
tourist
stares
longest
at
that
pathetic
stone
and
that
slow
dropping
water
when
he
comes
to
see
the
wonders
of
mcdougal's
cave
injun
joe's
cup
stands
first
in
the
list
of
the
cavern's
marvels
even
aladdin's
palace
cannot
rival
it
injun
joe
was
buried
near
the
mouth
of
the
cave
and
people
flocked
there
in
boats
and
wagons
from
the
towns
and
from
all
the
farms
and
hamlets
for
seven
miles
around
they
brought
their
children
and
all
sorts
of
provisions
and
confessed
that
they
had
had
almost
as
satisfactory
a
time
at
the
funeral
as
they
could
have
had
at
the
hanging
this
funeral
stopped
the
further
growth
of
one
thing
the
petition
to
the
governor
for
injun
joe's
pardon
the
petition
had
been
largely
signed
many
tearful
and
eloquent
meetings
had
been
held
and
a
committee
of
sappy
women
been
appointed
to
go
in
deep
mourning
and
wail
around
the
governor
and
implore
him
to
be
a
merciful
ass
and
trample
his
duty
under
foot
injun
joe
was
believed
to
have
killed
five
citizens
of
the
village
but
what
of
that
if
he
had
been
satan
himself
there
would
have
been
plenty
of
weaklings
ready
to
scribble
their
names
to
a
pardon
petition
and
drip
a
tear
on
it
from
their
permanently
impaired
and
leaky
water
works
the
morning
after
the
funeral
tom
took
huck
to
a
private
place
to
have
an
important
talk
huck
had
learned
all
about
tom's
adventure
from
the
welshman
and
the
widow
douglas
by
this
time
but
tom
said
he
reckoned
there
was
one
thing
they
had
not
told
him
that
thing
was
what
he
wanted
to
talk
about
now
huck's
face
saddened
he
said
i
know
what
it
is
you
got
into
no
and
never
found
anything
but
whiskey
nobody
told
me
it
was
you
but
i
just
knowed
it
must
a
ben
you
soon
as
i
heard
bout
that
whiskey
business
and
i
knowed
you
hadn't
got
the
money
becuz
you'd
a
got
at
me
some
way
or
other
and
told
me
even
if
you
was
mum
to
everybody
else
tom
something's
always
told
me
we'd
never
get
holt
of
that
swag
why
huck
i
never
told
on
that
tavern
keeper
you
know
his
tavern
was
all
right
the
saturday
i
went
to
the
picnic
don't
you
remember
you
was
to
watch
there
that
night
oh
yes
why
it
seems
bout
a
year
ago
it
was
that
very
night
that
i
follered
injun
joe
to
the
widder's
you
followed
him
yes
but
you
keep
mum
i
reckon
injun
joe's
left
friends
behind
him
and
i
don't
want
em
souring
on
me
and
doing
me
mean
tricks
if
it
hadn't
ben
for
me
he'd
be
down
in
texas
now
all
right
then
huck
told
his
entire
adventure
in
confidence
to
tom
who
had
only
heard
of
the
welshman's
part
of
it
before
well
said
huck
presently
coming
back
to
the
main
question
whoever
nipped
the
whiskey
in
no
nipped
the
money
too
i
reckon
anyways
it's
a
goner
for
us
tom
huck
that
money
wasn't
ever
in
no
what
huck
searched
his
comrade's
face
keenly
tom
have
you
got
on
the
track
of
that
money
again
huck
it's
in
the
cave
huck's
eyes
blazed
say
it
again
tom
the
money's
in
the
cave
tom
honest
injun
now
is
it
fun
or
earnest
earnest
huck
just
as
earnest
as
ever
i
was
in
my
life
will
you
go
in
there
with
me
and
help
get
it
out
i
bet
i
will
i
will
if
it's
where
we
can
blaze
our
way
to
it
and
not
get
lost
huck
we
can
do
that
without
the
least
little
bit
of
trouble
in
the
world
good
as
wheat
what
makes
you
think
the
money's
huck
you
just
wait
till
we
get
in
there
if
we
don't
find
it
i'll
agree
to
give
you
my
drum
and
every
thing
i've
got
in
the
world
i
will
by
jings
all
right
it's
a
whiz
when
do
you
say
right
now
if
you
say
it
are
you
strong
enough
is
it
far
in
the
cave
i
ben
on
my
pins
a
little
three
or
four
days
now
but
i
can't
walk
more'n
a
mile
tom
least
i
don't
think
i
could
it's
about
five
mile
into
there
the
way
anybody
but
me
would
go
huck
but
there's
a
mighty
short
cut
that
they
don't
anybody
but
me
know
about
huck
i'll
take
you
right
to
it
in
a
skiff
i'll
float
the
skiff
down
there
and
i'll
pull
it
back
again
all
by
myself
you
needn't
ever
turn
your
hand
over
less
start
right
off
tom
all
right
we
want
some
bread
and
meat
and
our
pipes
and
a
little
bag
or
two
and
two
or
three
kite
strings
and
some
of
these
new
fangled
things
they
call
lucifer
matches
i
tell
you
many's
the
time
i
wished
i
had
some
when
i
was
in
there
before
a
trifle
after
noon
the
boys
borrowed
a
small
skiff
from
a
citizen
who
was
absent
and
got
under
way
at
once
when
they
were
several
miles
below
cave
hollow
tom
said
now
you
see
this
bluff
here
looks
all
alike
all
the
way
down
from
the
cave
hollow
no
houses
no
wood
yards
bushes
all
alike
but
do
you
see
that
white
place
up
yonder
where
there's
been
a
landslide
well
that's
one
of
my
marks
we'll
get
ashore
now
they
landed
now
huck
where
we're
a
standing
you
could
touch
that
hole
i
got
out
of
with
a
fishing
pole
see
if
you
can
find
it
huck
searched
all
the
place
about
and
found
nothing
tom
proudly
marched
into
a
thick
clump
of
sumach
bushes
and
said
here
you
are
look
at
it
huck
it's
the
snuggest
hole
in
this
country
you
just
keep
mum
about
it
all
along
i've
been
wanting
to
be
a
robber
but
i
knew
i'd
got
to
have
a
thing
like
this
and
where
to
run
across
it
was
the
bother
we've
got
it
now
and
we'll
keep
it
quiet
only
we'll
let
joe
harper
and
ben
rogers
in
because
of
course
there's
got
to
be
a
gang
or
else
there
wouldn't
be
any
style
about
it
tom
sawyer's
gang
it
sounds
splendid
don't
it
huck
well
it
just
does
tom
and
who'll
we
rob
oh
most
anybody
waylay
people
that's
mostly
the
way
and
kill
them
no
not
always
hive
them
in
the
cave
till
they
raise
a
ransom
what's
a
ransom
money
you
make
them
raise
all
they
can
off'n
their
friends
and
after
you've
kept
them
a
year
if
it
ain't
raised
then
you
kill
them
that's
the
general
way
only
you
don't
kill
the
women
you
shut
up
the
women
but
you
don't
kill
them
they're
always
beautiful
and
rich
and
awfully
scared
you
take
their
watches
and
things
but
you
always
take
your
hat
off
and
talk
polite
they
ain't
anybody
as
polite
as
robbers
you'll
see
that
in
any
book
well
the
women
get
to
loving
you
and
after
they've
been
in
the
cave
a
week
or
two
weeks
they
stop
crying
and
after
that
you
couldn't
get
them
to
leave
if
you
drove
them
out
they'd
turn
right
around
and
come
back
it's
so
in
all
the
books
why
it's
real
bully
tom
i
believe
it's
better'n
to
be
a
pirate
yes
it's
better
in
some
ways
because
it's
close
to
home
and
circuses
and
all
that
by
this
time
everything
was
ready
and
the
boys
entered
the
hole
tom
in
the
lead
they
toiled
their
way
to
the
farther
end
of
the
tunnel
then
made
their
spliced
kite
strings
fast
and
moved
on
a
few
steps
brought
them
to
the
spring
and
tom
felt
a
shudder
quiver
all
through
him
he
showed
huck
the
fragment
of
candle
wick
perched
on
a
lump
of
clay
against
the
wall
and
described
how
he
and
becky
had
watched
the
flame
struggle
and
expire
the
boys
began
to
quiet
down
to
whispers
now
for
the
stillness
and
gloom
of
the
place
oppressed
their
spirits
they
went
on
and
presently
entered
and
followed
tom's
other
corridor
until
they
reached
the
jumping
off
place
the
candles
revealed
the
fact
that
it
was
not
really
a
precipice
but
only
a
steep
clay
hill
twenty
or
thirty
feet
high
tom
whispered
now
i'll
show
you
something
huck
he
held
his
candle
aloft
and
said
look
as
far
around
the
corner
as
you
can
do
you
see
that
there
on
the
big
rock
over
yonder
done
with
candle
smoke
tom
it's
a
cross
now
where's
your
number
two
under
the
cross
hey
right
yonder's
where
i
saw
injun
joe
poke
up
his
candle
huck
huck
stared
at
the
mystic
sign
awhile
and
then
said
with
a
shaky
voice
tom
less
git
out
of
here
what
and
leave
the
treasure
yes
leave
it
injun
joe's
ghost
is
round
about
there
certain
no
it
ain't
huck
no
it
ain't
it
would
ha'nt
the
place
where
he
died
away
out
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
five
mile
from
here
no
tom
it
wouldn't
it
would
hang
round
the
money
i
know
the
ways
of
ghosts
and
so
do
you
tom
began
to
fear
that
huck
was
right
mis
givings
gathered
in
his
mind
but
presently
an
idea
occurred
to
him
lookyhere
huck
what
fools
we're
making
of
ourselves
injun
joe's
ghost
ain't
a
going
to
come
around
where
there's
a
cross
the
point
was
well
taken
it
had
its
effect
tom
i
didn't
think
of
that
but
that's
so
it's
luck
for
us
that
cross
is
i
reckon
we'll
climb
down
there
and
have
a
hunt
for
that
box
tom
went
first
cutting
rude
steps
in
the
clay
hill
as
he
descended
huck
followed
four
avenues
opened
out
of
the
small
cavern
which
the
great
rock
stood
in
the
boys
examined
three
of
them
with
no
result
they
found
a
small
recess
in
the
one
nearest
the
base
of
the
rock
with
a
pallet
of
blankets
spread
down
in
it
also
an
old
suspender
some
bacon
rind
and
the
well
gnawed
bones
of
two
or
three
fowls
but
there
was
no
moneybox
the
lads
searched
and
researched
this
place
but
in
vain
tom
said
he
said
under
the
cross
well
this
comes
nearest
to
being
under
the
cross
it
can't
be
under
the
rock
itself
because
that
sets
solid
on
the
ground
they
searched
everywhere
once
more
and
then
sat
down
discouraged
huck
could
suggest
nothing
by
and
by
tom
said
lookyhere
huck
there's
footprints
and
some
candle
grease
on
the
clay
about
one
side
of
this
rock
but
not
on
the
other
sides
now
what's
that
for
i
bet
you
the
money
is
under
the
rock
i'm
going
to
dig
in
the
clay
that
ain't
no
bad
notion
tom
said
huck
with
animation
tom's
real
barlow
was
out
at
once
and
he
had
not
dug
four
inches
before
he
struck
wood
hey
huck
you
hear
that
huck
began
to
dig
and
scratch
now
some
boards
were
soon
uncovered
and
removed
they
had
concealed
a
natural
chasm
which
led
under
the
rock
tom
got
into
this
and
held
his
candle
as
far
under
the
rock
as
he
could
but
said
he
could
not
see
to
the
end
of
the
rift
he
proposed
to
explore
he
stooped
and
passed
under
the
narrow
way
descended
gradually
he
followed
its
winding
course
first
to
the
right
then
to
the
left
huck
at
his
heels
tom
turned
a
short
curve
by
and
by
and
exclaimed
my
goodness
huck
lookyhere
it
was
the
treasure
box
sure
enough
occupying
a
snug
little
cavern
along
with
an
empty
powder
keg
a
couple
of
guns
in
leather
cases
two
or
three
pairs
of
old
moccasins
a
leather
belt
and
some
other
rubbish
well
soaked
with
the
water
drip
got
it
at
last
said
huck
ploughing
among
the
tarnished
coins
with
his
hand
my
but
we're
rich
tom
huck
i
always
reckoned
we'd
get
it
it's
just
too
good
to
believe
but
we
have
got
it
sure
say
let's
not
fool
around
here
let's
snake
it
out
lemme
see
if
i
can
lift
the
box
it
weighed
about
fifty
pounds
tom
could
lift
it
after
an
awkward
fashion
but
could
not
carry
it
conveniently
i
thought
so
he
said
they
carried
it
like
it
was
heavy
that
day
at
the
ha'nted
house
i
noticed
that
i
reckon
i
was
right
to
think
of
fetching
the
little
bags
along
the
money
was
soon
in
the
bags
and
the
boys
took
it
up
to
the
cross
rock
now
less
fetch
the
guns
and
things
said
huck
no
huck
leave
them
there
they're
just
the
tricks
to
have
when
we
go
to
robbing
we'll
keep
them
there
all
the
time
and
we'll
hold
our
orgies
there
too
it's
an
awful
snug
place
for
orgies
what
orgies
i
dono
but
robbers
always
have
orgies
and
of
course
we've
got
to
have
them
too
come
along
huck
we've
been
in
here
a
long
time
it's
getting
late
i
reckon
i'm
hungry
too
we'll
eat
and
smoke
when
we
get
to
the
skiff
they
presently
emerged
into
the
clump
of
sumach
bushes
looked
warily
out
found
the
coast
clear
and
were
soon
lunching
and
smoking
in
the
skiff
as
the
sun
dipped
toward
the
horizon
they
pushed
out
and
got
under
way
tom
skimmed
up
the
shore
through
the
long
twilight
chatting
cheerily
with
huck
and
landed
shortly
after
dark
now
huck
said
tom
we'll
hide
the
money
in
the
loft
of
the
widow's
woodshed
and
i'll
come
up
in
the
morning
and
we'll
count
it
and
divide
and
then
we'll
hunt
up
a
place
out
in
the
woods
for
it
where
it
will
be
safe
just
you
lay
quiet
here
and
watch
the
stuff
till
i
run
and
hook
benny
taylor's
little
wagon
i
won't
be
gone
a
minute
he
disappeared
and
presently
returned
with
the
wagon
put
the
two
small
sacks
into
it
threw
some
old
rags
on
top
of
them
and
started
off
dragging
his
cargo
behind
him
when
the
boys
reached
the
welshman's
house
they
stopped
to
rest
just
as
they
were
about
to
move
on
the
welshman
stepped
out
and
said
hallo
who's
that
huck
and
tom
sawyer
good
come
along
with
me
boys
you
are
keeping
everybody
waiting
here
hurry
up
trot
ahead
i'll
haul
the
wagon
for
you
why
it's
not
as
light
as
it
might
be
got
bricks
in
it
or
old
metal
old
metal
said
tom
i
judged
so
the
boys
in
this
town
will
take
more
trouble
and
fool
away
more
time
hunting
up
six
bits
worth
of
old
iron
to
sell
to
the
foundry
than
they
would
to
make
twice
the
money
at
regular
work
but
that's
human
nature
hurry
along
hurry
along
the
boys
wanted
to
know
what
the
hurry
was
about
never
mind
you'll
see
when
we
get
to
the
widow
douglas
huck
said
with
some
apprehension
for
he
was
long
used
to
being
falsely
accused
mr
jones
we
haven't
been
doing
nothing
the
welshman
laughed
well
i
don't
know
huck
my
boy
i
don't
know
about
that
ain't
you
and
the
widow
good
friends
yes
well
she's
ben
good
friends
to
me
anyway
all
right
then
what
do
you
want
to
be
afraid
for
this
question
was
not
entirely
answered
in
huck's
slow
mind
before
he
found
himself
pushed
along
with
tom
into
mrs
douglas
drawing
room
mr
jones
left
the
wagon
near
the
door
and
followed
the
place

grandly
lighted

the

received
the
boys
as
heartily
as
any
one
could
well
receive
two
such
looking
beings
they
were
covered
with
clay
and
candle
grease
aunt
polly
blushed
crimson
with
humiliation
and
frowned
and
shook
her
head
at
tom
nobody
suffered
half
as
much
as
the
two
boys
did
however
mr
jones
said
tom

gave
him

i
stumbled
on

huck

a
hurry

and
say
i
can
tell
you
something
if
you
want
to
know
well
what
why
old
mr
jones
is
going
to
try
to
spring
something
on
the
people
here
tonight
but
i
overheard
him
tell
auntie
today
about
it
as
a
secret
but
i
reckon
it's
not
much
of
a
secret
now
everybody
knows
the
widow
too
for
all
she
tries
to
let
on
she
don't
mr
jones
was
bound
huck
should
be
here
couldn't
get
along
with
his
grand
secret
without
huck
you
know
secret
about
what
sid
about
huck
tracking
the
robbers
to
the
widow's
i
reckon
mr
jones
was
going
to
make
a
grand
time
over
his
surprise
but
i
bet
you
it
will
drop
pretty
flat
sid
chuckled
in
a
very
contented
and
satisfied
way
sid
was
it
you
that
told
oh
never
mind
who
it
was
somebody
told
that's
enough
sid
there's
only
one
person
in
this
town
mean
enough
to
do
that
and
that's
you
if
you
had
been
in
huck's
place
you'd
a
sneaked
down
the
hill
and
never
told
anybody
on
the
robbers
you
can't
do
any
but
mean
things
and
you
can't
bear
to
see
anybody
praised
for
doing
good
ones
there
no
thanks
as
the
widow
says
and
tom
cuffed
sid's
ears
and
helped
him
to
the
door
with
several
kicks
now
go
and
tell
auntie
if
you
dare
and
tomorrow
you'll
catch
it
some
minutes
later
the
widow's
guests
were
at
the
supper
table
and
a
dozen
children
were
propped
up
at
little
side
tables
in
the
same
room
after
the
fashion
of
that
country
and
that
day
at
the
proper
time
mr
jones
made
his
little
speech
in
which
he
thanked
the
widow
for
the
honor
she
was
doing
himself
and
his
sons
but
said
that
there
was
another
person
whose
modesty
and
so
forth
and
so
on
he
sprung
his
secret
about
huck's
share
in
the
adventure
in
the
finest
dramatic
manner
he
was
master
of
but
the
surprise
it
occasioned
was
largely
counterfeit
and
not
as
clamorous
and
effusive
as
it
might
have
been
under
happier
circumstances
however
the
widow
made
a
pretty
fair
show
of
astonishment
and
heaped
so
many
compliments
and
so
much
gratitude
upon
huck
that
he
almost
forgot
the
nearly
intolerable
discomfort
of
his
new
clothes
in
the
entirely
intolerable
discomfort
of
being
set
up
as
a
target
for
everybody's
gaze
and
everybody's
laudations
the
widow
said
she
meant
to
give
huck
a
home
under
her
roof
and
have
him
educated
and
that
when
she
could
spare
the
money
she
would
start
him
in
business
in
a
modest
way
tom's
chance
was
come
he
said
huck
don't
need
it
huck's
rich
nothing
but
a
heavy
strain
upon
the
good
manners
of
the
company
kept
back
the
due
and
proper
complimentary
laugh
at
this
pleasant
joke
but
the
silence
was
a
little
awkward
tom
broke
it
huck's
got
money
maybe
you
don't
believe
it
but
he's
got
lots
of
it
oh
you
needn't
smile
i
reckon
i
can
show
you
you
just
wait
a
minute
tom
ran
out
of
doors
the
company
looked
at
each
other
with
a
perplexed
interest
and
inquiringly
at
huck
who
was
tongue
tied
sid
what
ails
tom
said
aunt
polly
he
well
there
ain't
ever
any
making
of
that
boy
out
i
never
tom
entered
struggling
with
the
weight
of
his
sacks
and
aunt
polly
did
not
finish
her
sentence
tom
poured
the
mass
of
yellow
coin
upon
the
table
and
said
there
what
did
i
tell
you
half
of
it's
huck's
and
half
of
it's
mine
the
spectacle
took
the
general
breath
away
all
gazed
nobody
spoke
for
a
moment
then
there
was
a
unanimous
call
for
an
explanation
tom
said
he
could
furnish
it
and
he
did
the
tale
was
long
but
brimful
of
interest
there
was
scarcely
an
interruption
from
any
one
to
break
the
charm
of
its
flow
when
he
had
finished
mr
jones
said
i
thought
i
had
fixed
up
a
little
surprise
for
this
occasion
but
it
don't
amount
to
anything
now
this
one
makes
it
sing
mighty
small
i'm
willing
to
allow
the
money
was
counted
the
sum
amounted
to
a
little
over
twelve
thousand
dollars
it
was
more
than
any
one
present
had
ever
seen
at
one
time
before
though
several
persons
were
there
who
were
worth
considerably
more
than
that
in
property
chapter
xxxv
the
reader
may
rest
satisfied
that
tom's
and
huck's
windfall
made
a
mighty
stir
in
the
poor
little
village
of
st
petersburg
so
vast
a
sum
all
in
actual
cash
seemed
next
to
incredible
it
was
talked
about
gloated
over
glorified
until
the
reason
of
many
of
the
citizens
tottered
under
the
strain
of
the
unhealthy
excitement
every
haunted
house
in
st
petersburg
and
the
neighboring
villages
was
dissected
plank
by
plank
and
its
foundations
dug
up
and
ransacked
for
hidden
treasure
and
not
by
boys
but
men
pretty
grave
unromantic
men
too
some
of
them
wherever
tom
and
huck
appeared
they
were
courted
admired
stared
at
the
boys
were
not
able
to
remember
that
their
remarks
had
possessed
weight
before
but
now
their
sayings
were
treasured
and
repeated
everything
they
did
seemed
somehow
to
be
regarded
as
remarkable
they
had
evidently
lost
the
power
of
doing
and
saying
commonplace
things
moreover
their
past
history
was
raked
up
and
discovered
to
bear
marks
of
conspicuous
originality
the
village
paper
published
biographical
sketches
of
the
boys
the
widow
douglas
put
huck's
money
out
at
six
per
cent
and
judge
thatcher
did
the
same
with
tom's
at
aunt
polly's
request
each
lad
had
an
income
now
that
was
simply
prodigious
a
dollar
for
every
weekday
in
the
year
and
half
of
the
sundays
it
was
just
what
the
minister
got
no
it
was
what
he
was
promised
he
generally
couldn't
collect
it
a
dollar
and
a
quarter
a
week
would
board
lodge
and
school
a
boy
in
those
old
simple
days
and
clothe
him
and
wash
him
too
for
that
matter
judge
thatcher
had
conceived
a
great
opinion
of
tom
he
said
that
no
commonplace
boy
would
ever
have
got
his
daughter
out
of
the
cave
when
becky
told
her
father
in
strict
confidence
how
tom
had
taken
her
whipping
at
school
the
judge
was
visibly
moved
and
when
she
pleaded
grace
for
the
mighty
lie
which
tom
had
told
in
order
to
shift
that
whipping
from
her
shoulders
to
his
own
the
judge
said
with
a
fine
outburst
that
it
was
a
noble
a
generous
a
magnanimous
lie
a
lie
that
was
worthy
to
hold
up
its
head
and
march
down
through
history
breast
to
breast
with
george
washington's
lauded
truth
about
the
hatchet
becky
thought
her
father
had
never
looked
so
tall
and
so
superb
as
when
he
walked
the
floor
and
stamped
his
foot
and
said
that
she
went
straight
off
and
told
tom
about
it
judge
thatcher
hoped
to
see
tom
a
great
lawyer
or
a
great
soldier
some
day
he
said
he
meant
to
look
to
it
that
tom
should
be
admitted
to
the
national
military
academy
and
afterward
trained
in
the
best
law
school
in
the
country
in
order
that
he
might
be
ready
for
either
career
or
both
huck
finn's
wealth
and
the
fact
that
he
was
now
under
the
widow
douglas
protection
introduced
him
into
society
no
dragged
him
into
it
hurled
him
into
it
and
his
sufferings
were
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
the
widow's
servants
kept
him
clean
and
neat
combed
and
brushed
and
they
bedded
him
nightly
in
unsympathetic
sheets
that
had
not
one
little
spot
or
stain
which
he
could
press
to
his
heart
and
know
for
a
friend
he
had
to
eat
with
a
knife
and
fork
he
had
to
use
napkin
cup
and
plate
he
had
to
learn
his
book
he
had
to
go
to
church
he
had
to
talk
so
properly
that
speech
was
become
insipid
in
his
mouth
whithersoever
he
turned
the
bars
and
shackles
of
civilization
shut
him
in
and
bound
him
hand
and
foot
he
bravely
bore
his
miseries
three
weeks
and
then
one
day
turned
up
missing
for
forty
eight
hours
the
widow
hunted
for
him
everywhere
in
great
distress
the
public
were
profoundly
concerned
they
searched
high
and
low
they
dragged
the
river
for
his
body
early
the
third
morning
tom
sawyer
wisely
went
poking
among
some
old
empty
hogsheads
down
behind
the
abandoned
slaughter
house
and
in
one
of
them
he
found
the
refugee
huck
had
slept
there
he
had
just
breakfasted
upon
some
stolen
odds
and
ends
of
food
and
was
lying
off
now
in
comfort
with
his
pipe
he
was
unkempt
uncombed
and
clad
in
the
same
old
ruin
of
rags
that
had
made
him
picturesque
in
the
days
when
he
was
free
and
happy
tom
routed
him
out
told
him
the
trouble
he
had
been
causing
and
urged
him
to
go
home
huck's
face
lost
its
tranquil
content
and
took
a
melancholy
cast
he
said
don't
talk
about
it
tom
i've
tried
it
and
it
don't
work

huck's
joy
was
quenched
can't
let
me
in
tom
didn't
you
let
me
go
for
a
pirate
yes
but
that's
different
a
robber
is
more
high
toned
than
what
a
pirate
is
as
a
general
thing
in
most
countries
they're
awful
high
up
in
the
nobility
dukes
and
such
now
tom
hain't
you
always
ben
friendly
to
me
you
wouldn't
shet
me
out
would
you
tom
you
wouldn't
do
that
now
would
you
tom
huck
i
wouldn't
want
to
and
i
don't
want
to
but
what
would
people
say
why
they'd
say
mph
tom
sawyer's
gang
pretty
low
characters
in
it
they'd
mean
you
huck
you
wouldn't
like
that
and
i
wouldn't
huck
was
silent
for
some
time
engaged
in
a
mental
struggle
finally
he
said
well
i'll
go
back
to
the
widder
for
a
month
and
tackle
it
and
see
if
i
can
come
to
stand
it
if
you'll
let
me
b'long
to
the
gang
tom
all
right
huck
it's
a
whiz
come
along
old
chap
and
i'll
ask
the
widow
to
let
up
on
you
a
little
huck
will
you
tom
now
will
you
that's
good
if
she'll
let
up
on
some
of
the
roughest
things
i'll
smoke
private
and
cuss
private
and
crowd
through
or
bust
when
you
going
to
start
the
gang
and
turn
robbers
oh
right
off
we'll
get
the
boys
together
and
have
the
initiation
tonight
maybe
have
the
which
have
the
initiation
what's
that
it's
to
swear
to
stand
by
one
another
and
never
tell
the
gang's
secrets
even
if
you're
chopped
all
to
flinders
and
kill
anybody
and
all
his
family
that
hurts
one
of
the
gang
that's
gay
that's
mighty
gay
tom
i
tell
you
well
i
bet
it
is
and
all
that
swearing's
got
to
be
done
at
midnight
in
the
lonesomest
awfulest
place
you
can
find
a
ha'nted
house
is
the
best
but
they're
all
ripped
up
now
well
midnight's
good
anyway
tom
yes
so
it
is
and
you've
got
to
swear
on
a
coffin
and
sign
it
with
blood
now
that's
something
like
why
it's
a
million
times
bullier
than
pirating
i'll
stick
to
the
widder
till
i
rot
tom
and
if
i
git
to
be
a
reg'lar
ripper
of
a
robber
and
everybody
talking
bout
it
i
reckon
she'll
be
proud
she
snaked
me
in
out
of
the
wet
conclusion
so
endeth
this
chronicle
it
being
strictly
a
history
of
a
boy
it
must
stop
here
the
story
could
not
go
much
further
without
becoming
the
history
of
a
man
when
one
writes
a
novel
about
grown
people
he
knows
exactly
where
to
stop
that
is
with
a
marriage
but
when
he
writes
of
juveniles
he
must
stop
where
he
best
can
most
of
the
characters
that

some
day
it
may
seem
worth
while
to
take
up
the
story
of
the
younger
ones
again
and
see
what
sort
of
men
and
women
they
turned
out
to
be
therefore
it
will
be
wisest
not
to
reveal
any
of
that

their

at

what
is

i
a

the

b
personal
merit
old
man
and
the
young
man
had
been
conversing
the
old
man
had
asserted
that
the
human
being
is
merely
a
machine
and
nothing
more
the
young
man
objected
and
asked
him
to
go
into
particulars
and
furnish
his
reasons
for
his
position
old
man
what
are
the
materials
of
which
a
steam
engine
is
made

are
the
metals
suddenly
deposited
in

y
m
no
it
is
the
patient
work
of
countless
ages
o
m
you
could
make
the
engine
out
of
the
rocks
themselves
y
m
yes
a
brittle
one
and
not
valuable
o
m
you
would
not
require
much
of
such
an
engine
as
that
y
m
no
substantially
nothing
o
m
to
make
a
fine
and
capable
engine
how
would
you
proceed
y
m
drive
tunnels
and
shafts
into
the
hills
blast
out
the
iron
ore
crush
it
smelt
it
reduce
it

put
some
of

through

and
combine
several
metals
of
which
brass
is
made
o
m
then
y
m
out
of
the
perfected
result
build
the
fine
engine
o
m
you
would
require
much
of
this
one
y
m
oh
indeed
yes
o
m
it
could
drive
lathes

polishers
in
a
word
all
the
cunning
machines
of
a

factory
y

it

what

do

nothing

y
m
yes
o
m
but
not
the
stone

y

no
o

the

of

of

o

y
m
personal
merits
how
do
you
mean
o
m
it
would
be
personally
entitled
to
the
credit
of
its
own
performance
y
m
the
engine
certainly
not
o
m
why
not
y
m
because
its
performance
is
not
personal
it
is
the
result
of
the
law
of
construction
it
is
not
a
merit
that
it
does
the
things
which
it
is
set
to
do
it
can't
help
doing
them
o
m
and
it
is
not
a
personal
demerit
in
the
stone
machine
that
it
does
so
little
y
m
certainly
not
it
does
no
more
and
no
less
than
the
law
of
its
make
permits
and
compels
it
to
do
there
is
nothing
personal
about
it
it
cannot
choose
in
this
process
of
working
up
to
the
matter
is
it
your
idea
to
work
up
to
the
proposition
that
man
and
a
machine
are
about
the
same
thing
and
that
there
is
no
personal
merit
in
the
performance
of
either
o
m
yes
but
do
not
be
offended
i
am
meaning
no
offense
what
makes
the
grand
difference
between
the
stone
engine
and
the
steel
one
shall
we
call
it
training
education
shall
we
call
the
stone
engine
a
savage
and
the
steel
one
a
civilized
man
the
original
rock
contained
the
stuff
of
which
the
steel
one
was
built
but
along
with
a
lot
of
sulphur
and
stone
and
other
obstructing
inborn
heredities
brought
down
from
the
old
geologic
ages
prejudices
let
us
call
them
prejudices
which
nothing
within
the
rock
itself
had
either
power
to
remove
or
any
desire
to
remove
will
you
take
note
of
that
phrase
y
m
yes
i
have
written
it
down
prejudices
which
nothing
within
the
rock
itself
had
either
power
to
remove
or
any
desire
to
remove
go
on
o
m
prejudices
must
be
removed
by
outside
influences
or
not
at
all
put
that
down
y
m
very
well
must
be
removed
by
outside
influences
or
not
at
all
go
on
o
m
the
iron's
prejudice
against
ridding
itself
of
the
cumbering
rock
to
make
it
more
exact
the
iron's
absolute
indifference
as
to
whether
the
rock
be
removed
or
not
then
comes
the
outside
influence
and
grinds
the
rock
to
powder
and
sets
the
ore
free
the
iron
in
the
ore
is
still
captive
an
outside
influence
smelts
it
free
of
the
clogging
ore
the
iron
is
emancipated
iron
now
but
indifferent
to
further
progress
an
outside
influence
beguiles
it
into
the
bessemer
furnace
and
refines
it
into
steel
of
the
first
quality
it
is
educated
now
its
training
is
complete
and
it
has
reached
its
limit
by
no
possible
process
can
it
be
educated
into
gold
will
you
set
that
down
y
m
yes
everything
has
its
limit
iron
ore
cannot
be
educated
into
gold
o
m
there
are
gold
men
and
tin
men
and
copper
men
and
leaden
men
and
steel
men
and
so
on
and
each
has
the
limitations
of
his
nature
his
heredities
his
training
and
his
environment
you
can
build
engines
out
of
each
of
these
metals
and
they
will
all
perform
but
you
must
not
require
the
weak
ones
to
do
equal
work
with
the
strong
ones
in
each
case
to
get
the
best
results
you
must
free
the
metal
from
its
obstructing
prejudicial
ones
by
education
smelting
refining
and
so
forth
y
m
you
have
arrived
at
man
now
o
m
yes
man
the
machine
man
the
impersonal
engine
whatsoever
a
man
is
is
due
to
his
make
and
to
the
influences
brought
to
bear
upon
it
by
his
heredities
his
habitat
his
associations
he
is
moved
directed
commanded
by
exterior
influences
solely
he
originates
nothing
not
even
a
thought
y
m
oh
come
where
did
i
get
my
opinion
that
this
which
you
are
talking
is
all
foolishness
o
m
it
is
a
quite
natural
opinion
indeed
an
inevitable
opinion
but
you
did
not
create
the
materials
out
of
which
it
is
formed
they
are
odds
and
ends
of
thoughts
impressions
feelings
gathered
unconsciously
from
a
thousand
books
a
thousand
conversations
and
from
streams
of
thought
and
feeling
which
have
flowed
down
into
your
heart
and
brain
out
of
the
hearts
and
brains
of
centuries
of
ancestors
personally
you
did
not
create
even
the
smallest
microscopic
fragment
of
the
materials
out
of
which
your
opinion
is
made
and
personally
you
cannot
claim
even
the
slender
merit
of
putting
the
borrowed
materials
together
that
was
done
automatically
by
your
mental
machinery
in
strict
accordance
with
the
law
of
that
machinery's
construction
and
you
not
only
did
not
make
that
machinery
yourself
but
you
have
not
even
any
command
over
it
y
m
this
is
too
much
you
think
i
could
have
formed
no
opinion
but
that
one
o
m
spontaneously
no
and
you
did
not
form
that
one
your
machinery
did
it
for
you
automatically
and
instantly
without
reflection
or
the
need
of
it
y
m
suppose
i
had
reflected
how
then
o
m
suppose
you
try
y
m
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
have
reflected
o
m
you
mean
you
have
tried
to
change
your
opinion
as
an
experiment
y
m
yes
o
m
with
success
y
m
no
it
remains
the
same
it
is
impossible
to
change
it
o
m
i
am
sorry
but
you
see
yourself
that
your
mind
is
merely
a
machine
nothing
more
you
have
no
command
over
it
it
has
no
command
over
itself
it
is
worked
solely
from
the
outside
that
is
the
law
of
its
make
it
is
the
law
of
all
machines
y
m
can't
i
ever
change
one
of
these
automatic
opinions
o
m
no
you
can't
yourself
but
exterior
influences
can
do
it
y
m
and
exterior
ones
only
o
m
yes
exterior
ones
only
y
m
that
position
is
untenable
i
may
say
ludicrously
untenable
o
m
what
makes
you
think
so
y
m
i
don't
merely
think
it
i
know
it
suppose
i
resolve
to
enter
upon
a
course
of
thought
and
study
and
reading
with
the
deliberate
purpose
of
changing
that
opinion
and
suppose
i
succeed
that
is
not
the
work
of
an
exterior
impulse
the
whole
of
it
is
mine
and
personal
for
i
originated
the
project
o
m
not
a
shred
of
it
it
grew
out
of
this
talk
with
me
but
for
that
it
would
not
have
occurred
to
you
no
man
ever
originates
anything
all
his
thoughts
all
his
impulses
come
from
the
outside
y
m
it's
an
exasperating
subject
the
first
man
had
original
thoughts
anyway
there
was
nobody
to
draw
from
o
m
it
is
a
mistake
adam's
thoughts
came
to
him
from
the
outside
you
have
a
fear
of
death
you
did
not
invent
that
you
got
it
from
outside
from
talking
and
teaching
adam
had
no
fear
of
death
none
in
the
world
y
m
yes
he
had
o
m
when
he
was
created
y
m
no
o
m
when
then
y
m
when
he
was
threatened
with
it
o
m
then
it
came
from
outside
adam
is
quite
big
enough
let
us
not
try
to
make
a
god
of
him
none
but
gods
have
ever
had
a
thought
which
did
not
come
from
the
outside
adam
probably
had
a
good
head
but
it
was
of
no
sort
of
use
to
him
until
it
was
filled
up
from
the
outside
he
was
not
able
to
invent
the
triflingest
little
thing
with
it
he
had
not
a
shadow
of
a
notion
of
the
difference
between
good
and
evil
he
had
to
get
the
idea
from
the
outside
neither
he
nor
eve
was
able
to
originate
the
idea
that
it
was
immodest
to
go
naked
the
knowledge
came
in
with
the
apple
from
the
outside
a
man's
brain
is
so
constructed
that
it
can
originate
nothing
whatsoever
it
can
only
use
material
obtained
outside
it
is
merely
a
machine
and
it
works
automatically
not
by
will
power
it
has
no
command
over
itself
its
owner
has
no
command
over
it
y
m
well
never
mind
adam
but
certainly
shakespeare's
creations
o
m
no
you
mean
shakespeare's
imitations
shakespeare
created
nothing
he
correctly
observed
and
he
marvelously
painted
he
exactly
portrayed
people
whom
god
had
created
but
he
created
none
himself
let
us
spare
him
the
slander
of
charging
him
with
trying
shakespeare
could
not
create
he
was
a
machine
and
machines
do
not
create
y
m
where
was
his
excellence
then
o
m
in
this
he
was
not
a
sewing
machine
like
you
and
me
he
was
a
gobelin
loom
the
threads
and
the
colors
came
into
him
from
the
outside
outside
influences
suggestions
experiences
reading
seeing
plays
playing
plays
borrowing
ideas
and
so
on
framed
the
patterns
in
his
mind
and
started
up
his
complex
and
admirable
machinery
and
it
automatically
turned
out
that
pictured
and
gorgeous
fabric
which
still
compels
the
astonishment
of
the
world
if
shakespeare
had
been
born
and
bred
on
a
barren
and
unvisited
rock
in
the
ocean
his
mighty
intellect
would
have
had
no
outside
material
to
work
with
and
could
have
invented
none
and
no
outside
influences
teachings
moldings
persuasions
inspirations
of
a
valuable
sort
and
could
have
invented
none
and
so
shakespeare
would
have
produced
nothing
in
turkey
he
would
have
produced
something
something
up
to
the
highest
limit
of
turkish
influences
associations
and
training
in
france
he
would
have
produced
something
better
something
up
to
the
highest
limit
of
the
french
influences
and
training
in
england
he
rose
to
the
highest
limit
attainable
through
the
outside
helps
afforded
by
that
land's
ideals
influences
and
training
you
and
i
are
but
sewing
machines
we
must
turn
out
what
we
can
we
must
do
our
endeavor
and
care
nothing
at
all
when
the
unthinking
reproach
us
for
not
turning
out
gobelins
y
m
and
so
we
are
mere
machines
and
machines
may
not
boast
nor
feel
proud
of
their
performance
nor
claim
personal
merit
for
it
nor
applause
and
praise
it
is
an
infamous
doctrine
o
m
it
isn't
a
doctrine
it
is
merely
a
fact
y
m
i
suppose
then
there
is
no
more
merit
in
being
brave
than
in
being
a
coward
o
m
personal
merit
no
a
brave
man
does
not
create
his
bravery
he
is
entitled
to
no
personal
credit
for
possessing
it
it
is
born
to
him
a
baby
born
with
a
billion
dollars
where
is
the
personal
merit
in
that
a
baby
born
with
nothing
where
is
the
personal
demerit
in
that
the
one
is
fawned
upon
admired
worshiped
by
sycophants
the
other
is
neglected
and
despised
where
is
the
sense
in
it
y
m
sometimes
a
timid
man
sets
himself
the
task
of
conquering
his
cowardice
and
becoming
brave
and
succeeds
what
do
you
say
to
that
o
m
that
it
shows
the
value
of
training
in
right
directions
over
training
in
wrong
ones
inestimably
valuable
is
training
influence
education
in
right
directions
training
one's
self
approbation
to
elevate
its
ideals
y
m
but
as
to
merit
the
personal
merit
of
the
victorious
coward's
project
and
achievement
o
m
there
isn't
any
in
the
world's
view
he
is
a
worthier
man
than
he
was
before
but
he
didn't
achieve
the
change
the
merit
of
it
is
not
his
y
m
whose
then
o
m
his
make
and
the
influences
which
wrought
upon
it
from
the
outside
y
m
his
make
o
m
to
start
with
he
was
not
utterly
and
completely
a
coward
or
the
influences
would
have
had
nothing
to
work
upon
he
was
not
afraid
of
a
cow
though
perhaps
of
a
bull
not
afraid
of
a
woman
but
afraid
of
a
man
there
was
something
to
build
upon
there
was
a
seed
no
seed
no
plant
did
he
make
that
seed
himself
or
was
it
born
in
him
it
was
no
merit
of
his
that
the
seed
was
there
y
m
well
anyway
the
idea
of
cultivating
it
the
resolution
to
cultivate
it
was
meritorious
and
he
originated
that
o
m
he
did
nothing
of
the
kind
it
came
whence
all
impulses
good
or
bad
come
from
outside
if
that
timid
man
had
lived
all
his
life
in
a
community
of
human
rabbits
had
never
read
of
brave
deeds
had
never
heard
speak
of
them
had
never
heard
any
one
praise
them
nor
express
envy
of
the
heroes
that
had
done
them
he
would
have
had
no
more
idea
of
bravery
than
adam
had
of
modesty
and
it
could
never
by
any
possibility
have
occurred
to
him
to
resolve
to
become
brave
he
could
not
originate
the
idea
it
had
to
come
to
him
from
the
outside
and
so
when
he
heard
bravery
extolled
and
cowardice
derided
it
woke
him
up
he
was
ashamed
perhaps
his
sweetheart
turned
up
her
nose
and
said
i
am
told
that
you
are
a
coward
it
was
not
he
that
turned
over
the
new
leaf
she
did
it
for
him
he
must
not
strut
around
in
the
merit
of
it
it
is
not
his
y
m
but
anyway
he
reared
the
plant
after
she
watered
the
seed
o
m
no
outside
influences
reared
it
at
the
command
and
trembling
he
marched
out
into
the
field
with
other
soldiers
and
in
the
daytime
not
alone
and
in
the
dark
he
had
the
influence
of
example
he
drew
courage
from
his
comrades
courage
he
was
afraid
and
wanted
to
run
but
he
did
not
dare
he
was
afraid
to
run
with
all
those
soldiers
looking
on
he
was
progressing
you
see
the
moral
fear
of
shame
had
risen
superior
to
the
physical
fear
of
harm
by
the
end
of
the
campaign
experience
will
have
taught
him
that
not
all
who
go
into
battle
get
hurt
an
outside
influence
which
will
be
helpful
to
him
and
he

also
have
learned
how
sweet
it
is
to
be
praised
for
courage
and
be
huzza'd
at
with
tear
choked
voices
as
the
war
worn
regiment
marches
past
the
worshiping
multitude
with
flags
flying
and
the
drums
beating
after
that
he
will
be
as
securely
brave
as
any
veteran
in
the
army
and
there
will
not
be
a
shade
nor
suggestion
of
personal
merit
in
it
anywhere
it
will
all
have
come
from
the
outside
the
victoria
cross
breeds
more
heroes
than
y
m
hang
it
where
is
the
sense
in
his
becoming
brave
if
he
is
to
get
no
credit
for
it
o
m
your
question
will
answer
itself
presently
it
involves
an
important
detail
of
man's
make
which
we
have
not
yet
touched
upon
y
m
what
detail
is
that
o
m
the
impulse
which
moves
a
person
to
do
things
the
only
impulse
that
ever
moves
a
person
to
do
a
thing
y
m
the
only
one
is
there
but
one
o
m
that
is
all
there
is
only
one
y
m
well
certainly
that
is
a
strange
enough
doctrine
what
is
the
sole
impulse
that
ever
moves
a
person
to
do
a
thing
o
m
the
impulse
to
content
his
own
spirit
the
necessity
of
contenting
his
own
spirit
and
winning
its
approval
y
m
oh
come
that
won't
do
o
m
why
won't
it
y
m
because
it
puts
him
in
the
attitude
of
always
looking
out
for
his
own
comfort
and
advantage
whereas
an
unselfish
man
often
does
a
thing
solely
for
another
person's
good
when
it
is
a
positive
disadvantage
to
himself
o
m
it
is
a
mistake
the
act
must
do
him
good
first
otherwise
he
will
not
do
it
he
may
think
he
is
doing
it
solely
for
the
other
person's
sake
but
it
is
not
so
he
is
contenting
his
own
spirit
first
the
other's
person's
benefit
has
to
always
take
second
place
y
m
what
a
fantastic
idea
what
becomes
of
self
sacrifice
please
answer
me
that
o
m
what
is
self
sacrifice
y
m
the
doing
good
to
another
person
where
no
shadow
nor
suggestion
of
benefit
to
one's
self
can
result
from
it
ii
man's
sole
impulse
the
securing
of
his
own
approval
old
man
there
have
been
instances
of
it
you
think
young
man
instances
millions
of
them
o
m
you
have
not
jumped
to
conclusions
you
have
examined
them
critically
y
m
they
don't
need
it
the
acts
themselves
reveal
the
golden
impulse
back
of
them
o
m
for
instance
y
m
well
then
for
instance
take
the
case
in
the
book
here
the
man
lives
three
miles
up
town
it
is
bitter
cold
snowing
hard
midnight
he
is
about
to
enter
the
horse
car
when
a
gray
and
ragged
old
woman
a
touching
picture
of
misery
puts
out
her
lean
hand
and
begs
for
rescue
from
hunger
and
death
the
man
finds
that
he
has
a
quarter
in
his
pocket
but
he
does
not
hesitate
he
gives
it
her
and
trudges
home
through
the
storm
there
it
is
noble
it
is
beautiful
its
grace
is
marred
by
no
fleck
or
blemish
or
suggestion
of
self
interest
o
m
what
makes
you
think
that
y
m
pray
what
else
could
i
think
do
you
imagine
that
there
is
some
other
way
of
looking
at
it
o
m
can
you
put
yourself
in
the
man's
place
and
tell
me
what
he
felt
and
what
he
thought
y
m
easily
the
sight
of
that
suffering
old
face
pierced
his
generous
heart
with
a
sharp
pain
he
could
not
bear
it
he
could
endure
the
three
mile
walk
in
the
storm
but
he
could
not
endure
the
tortures
his
conscience
would
suffer
if
he
turned
his
back
and
left
that
poor
old
creature
to
perish
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
sleep
for
thinking
of
it
o
m
what
was
his
state
of
mind
on
his
way
home
y
m
it
was
a
state
of
joy
which
only
the
self
sacrificer
knows
his
heart
sang
he
was
unconscious
of
the
storm
o
m
he
felt
well
y
m
one
cannot
doubt
it
o
m
very
well
now
let
us
add
up
the
details
and
see
how
much
he
got
for
his
twenty
five
cents
let
us
try
to
find
out
the
real
why
of
his
making
the
investment
in
the
first
place
he
couldn't
bear
the
pain
which
the
old
suffering
face
gave
him
so
he
was
thinking
of
his
pain
this
good
man
he
must
buy
a
salve
for
it
if
he
did
not
succor
the
old
woman
his
conscience
would
torture
him
all
the
way
home
thinking
of
his
pain
again
he
must
buy
relief
for
that
if
he
didn't
relieve
the
old
woman
he
would
not
get
any
sleep
he
must
buy
some
sleep
still
thinking
of
himself
you
see
thus
to
sum
up
he
bought
himself
free
of
a
sharp
pain
in
his
heart
he
bought
himself
free
of
the
tortures
of
a
waiting
conscience
he
bought
a
whole
night's
sleep
all
for
twenty
five
cents
it
should
make
wall
street
ashamed
of
itself
on
his
way
home
his
heart
was
joyful
and
it
sang
profit
on
top
of
profit
the
impulse
which
moved
the
man
to
succor
the
old
woman
was
first
to
content
his
own
spirit
secondly
to
relieve
her
sufferings
is
it
your
opinion
that
men's
acts
proceed
from
one
central
and
unchanging
and
inalterable
impulse
or
from
a
variety
of
impulses
y
m
from
a
variety
of
course
some
high
and
fine
and
noble
others
not
what
is
your
opinion
o
m
then
there
is
but
one
law
one
source
y
m
that
both
the
noblest
impulses
and
the
basest
proceed
from
that
one
source
o
m
yes
y
m
will
you
put
that
law
into
words
o
m
yes
this
is
the
law
keep
it
in
your
mind
from
his
cradle
to
his
grave
a
man
never
does
a
single
thing
which
has
any
first
and
foremost
object
but
one
to
secure
peace
of
mind
spiritual
comfort
for
himself
y
m
come
he
never
does
anything
for
any
one
else's
comfort
spiritual
or
physical
o
m
no
except
on
those
distinct
terms
that
it
shall
first
secure
his
own
spiritual
comfort
otherwise
he
will
not
do
it
y
m
it
will
be
easy
to
expose
the
falsity
of
that
proposition
o
m
for
instance
y
m
take
that
noble
passion
love
of
country
patriotism
a
man
who
loves
peace
and
dreads
pain
leaves
his
pleasant
home
and
his
weeping
family
and
marches
out
to
manfully
expose
himself
to
hunger
cold
wounds
and
death
is
that
seeking
spiritual
comfort
o
m
he
loves
peace
and
dreads
pain
y
m
yes
o
m
then
perhaps
there
is
something
that
he
loves
more
than
he
loves
peace
the
approval
of
his
neighbors
and
the
public
and
perhaps
there
is
something
which
he
dreads
more
than
he
dreads
pain
the
disapproval
of
his
neighbors
and
the
public
if
he
is
sensitive
to
shame
he
will
go
to
the
field
not
because
his
spirit
will
be
entirely
comfortable
there
but
because
it
will
be
more
comfortable
there
than
it
would
be
if
he
remained
at
home
he
will
always
do
the
thing
which
will
bring
him
the
most
mental
comfort
for
that
is
the
sole
law
of
his
life
he
leaves
the
weeping
family
behind
he
is
sorry
to
make
them
uncomfortable
but
not
sorry
enough
to
sacrifice
his
own
comfort
to
secure
theirs
y
m
do
you
really
believe
that
mere
public
opinion
could
force
a
timid
and
peaceful
man
to
o
m
go
to
war
yes
public
opinion
can
force
some
men
to
do
anything
y
m
anything
o
m
yes
anything
y
m
i
don't
believe
that
can
it
force
a
right
principled
man
to
do
a
wrong
thing
o
m
yes
y
m
can
it
force
a
kind
man
to
do
a
cruel
thing
o
m
yes
y
m
give
an
instance
o
m
alexander
hamilton
was
a
conspicuously
high
principled
man
he
regarded
dueling
as
wrong
and
as
opposed
to
the
teachings
of
religion
but
in
deference
to
public
opinion
he
fought
a
duel
he
deeply
loved
his
family
but
to
buy
public
approval
he
treacherously
deserted
them
and
threw
his
life
away
ungenerously
leaving
them
to
lifelong
sorrow
in
order
that
he
might
stand
well
with
a
foolish
world
in
the
then
condition
of
the
public
standards
of
honor
he
could
not
have
been
comfortable
with
the
stigma
upon
him
of
having
refused
to
fight
the
teachings
of
religion
his
devotion
to
his
family
his
kindness
of
heart
his
high
principles
all
went
for
nothing
when
they
stood
in
the
way
of
his
spiritual
comfort
a
man
will
do
anything
no
matter
what
it
is
to
secure
his
spiritual
comfort
and
he
can
neither
be
forced
nor
persuaded
to
any
act
which
has
not
that
goal
for
its
object
hamilton's
act
was
compelled
by
the
inborn
necessity
of
contenting
his
own
spirit
in
this
it
was
like
all
the
other
acts
of
his
life
and
like
all
the
acts
of
all
men's
lives
do
you
see
where
the
kernel
of
the
matter
lies
a
man
cannot
be
comfortable
without
his
own
approval
he
will
secure
the
largest
share
possible
of
that
at
all
costs
all
sacrifices
y
m
a
minute
ago
you
said
hamilton
fought
that
duel
to
get
public
approval
o
m
i
did
by
refusing
to
fight
the
duel
he
would
have
secured
his
family's
approval
and
a
large
share
of
his
own
but
the
public
approval
was
more
valuable
in
his
eyes
than
all
other
approvals
put
together
in
the
earth
or
above
it
to
secure
that
would
furnish
him
the
most
comfort
of
mind
the
most
self
approval
so
he
sacrificed
all
other
values
to
get
it
y
m
some
noble
souls
have
refused
to
fight
duels
and
have
manfully
braved
the
public
contempt
o
m
they
acted
according
to
their
make
they
valued
their
principles
and
the
approval
of
their
families
above
the
public
approval
they
took
the
thing
they
valued
most
and
let
the
rest
go
they
took
what
would
give
them
the
largest
share
of
personal
contentment
and
approval
a
man
always
does
public
opinion
cannot
force
that
kind
of
men
to
go
to
the
wars
when
they
go
it
is
for
other
reasons
other
spirit
contenting

can't

peril
a
man
of
a

could
and
so
he

person
all

happy

not
even

the
lofty
and
gracious

no
it

slave
of

the
mother
will
go

she
will
starve
that
it
may
have

suffer

to

of
yours

is
a
fact
y
m
of

you
must
admit
that
there
are
some
acts
which
o
m
no
there
is
no
act
large

fine
or
mean
which
springs
from
any
motive
but
the
one
the
necessity
of
appeasing
and
contenting
one's
own
spirit
y
m
the
world's
philanthropists
o
m
i
honor
them
i
uncover
my
head
to
them
from
habit
and
training
and
they
could
not
know
comfort
or
happiness
or
self
approval
if
they
did
not
work
and
spend
for
the
unfortunate
it
makes
them
happy
to
see
others
happy
and
so
with
money
and
labor
they
buy
what
they
are
after
happiness
self
approval
why
don't
miners
do
the
same
thing
because
they
can
get
a
thousandfold
more
happiness
by
not
doing
it
there
is
no
other
reason
they
follow
the
law
of
their
make
y
m
what
do
you
say
of
duty
for
duty's
sake
o
m
that
it
does
not
exist
duties
are
not
performed
for
duty's
sake
but
because
their
neglect
would
make
the
man
uncomfortable
a
man
performs
but
one
duty
the
duty
of
contenting
his
spirit
the
duty
of
making
himself
agreeable
to
himself
if
he
can
most
satisfyingly
perform
this
sole
and
only
duty
by
helping
his
neighbor
he
will
do
it
if
he
can
most
satisfyingly
perform
it
by
swindling
his
neighbor
he
will
do
it
but
he
always
looks
out
for
number
one
first
the
effects
upon
others
are
a
secondary
matter
men
pretend
to
self
sacrifices
but
this
is
a
thing
which
in
the
ordinary
value
of
the
phrase
does
not
exist
and
has
not
existed
a
man
often
honestly
thinks
he
is
sacrificing
himself
merely
and
solely
for
some
one
else
but
he
is
deceived
his
bottom
impulse
is
to
content
a
requirement
of
his
nature
and
training
and
thus
acquire
peace
for
his
soul
y
m
apparently
then
all
men
both
good
and
bad
ones
devote
their
lives
to
contenting
their
consciences
o
m
yes
that
is
a
good
enough
name
for
it
conscience
that
independent
sovereign
that
insolent
absolute
monarch
inside
of

man
who
is
the
man's
master
there
are
all
kinds
of
consciences
because
there
are
all
kinds
of
men
you
satisfy
an
assassin's
conscience
in
one
way
a
philanthropist's
in
another
a
miser's
in
another
a
burglar's
in

another
as
a
guide
or
incentive
to
any
authoritatively
prescribed
line
of
morals
or
conduct
leaving
training
out
of
the
account
a
man's
conscience
is
totally
valueless
i
know
a
kind
hearted
kentuckian
whose
self
approval
was
lacking
whose
conscience
was
troubling
him
to
phrase
it
with
exactness
because
he
had
neglected
to
kill
a
certain
man
a
man
whom
he
had
never
seen
the
stranger
had
killed
this
man's
friend
in
a
fight
this
man's
kentucky
training
made
it
a
duty
to
kill
the
stranger
for
it
he
neglected
his
duty
kept
dodging
it
shirking
it
putting
it
off
and
his
unrelenting
conscience
kept
persecuting
him
for
this
conduct
at
last
to
get
ease
of
mind
comfort
self
approval
he
hunted
up
the
stranger
and
took
his
life
it
was
an
immense
act
of
self
sacrifice
as
per
the
usual
definition
for
he
did
not
want
to
do
it
and
he
never
would
have
done
it
if
he
could
have
bought
a
contented
spirit
and
an
unworried
mind
at
smaller
cost
but
we
are
so
made
that
we
will
pay
anything
for
that
contentment
even
another
man's
life
y
m
you
spoke
a
moment
ago
of
trained
consciences
you
mean
that
we
are
not
born
with
consciences
competent
to
guide
us
aright
o
m
if
we
were
children
and
savages
would
know
right
from
wrong
and
not
have
to
be
taught
it
y
m
but
consciences
can
be
trained
o
m
yes
y
m
of
course
by
parents
teachers
the
pulpit
and
books
o
m
yes
they
do
their
share
they
do
what
they
can
y
m
and
the
rest
is
done
by
o
m
oh
a
million
unnoticed
influences
for
good
or
bad
influences
which
work
without
rest
during
every
waking
moment
of
a
man's
life
from
cradle
to
grave
y
m
you
have
tabulated
these
o
m
many
of
them
yes
y
m
will
you
read
me
the
result
o
m
another
time
yes
it
would
take
an
hour
y
m
a
conscience
can
be
trained
to
shun
evil
and
prefer
good
o
m
yes
y
m
but
will
it
for
spirit
contenting
reasons
only
o
m
it
can't
be
trained
to
do
a
thing
for
any
other
reason
the
thing
is
impossible
y
m
there
must
be
a
genuinely
and
utterly
self
sacrificing
act
recorded
in
human
history
somewhere
o
m
you
are
young
you
have
many
years
before
you
search
one
out
y
m
it
does
seem
to
me
that
when
a
man
sees
a
fellow
being
struggling
in
the
water
and
jumps
in
at
the
risk
of
his
life
to
save
him
o
m
wait
describe
the
man
describe
the
fellow
being
state
if
there
is
an
audience
present
or
if
they
are
alone
y
m
what
have
these
things
to
do
with
the
splendid
act
o
m
very
much
shall
we
suppose
as
a
beginning
that
the
two
are
alone
in
a
solitary
place
at
midnight
y
m
if
you
choose
o
m
and
that
the
fellow
being
is
the
man's
daughter
y
m
well
n
no
make
it
someone
else
o
m
a
filthy
drunken
ruffian
then
y
m
i
see
circumstances
alter
cases
i
suppose
that
if
there
was
no
audience
to
observe
the
act
the
man
wouldn't
perform
it
o
m
but
there
is
here
and
there
a
man
who
would
people
for
instance
like
the
man
who
lost
his
life
trying
to
save
the
child
from
the
fire
and
the
man
who
gave
the
needy
old
woman
his
twenty
five
cents
and
walked
home
in
the
storm
there
are
here
and
there
men
like
that
who
would
do
it
and
why
because
they
couldn't
bear
to
see
a
fellow
being
struggling
in
the
water
and
not
jump
in
and
help
it
would
give
them
pain
they
would
save
the
fellow
being
on
that
account
they
wouldn't
do
it
otherwise
they
strictly
obey
the
law
which
i
have
been
insisting
upon
you
must
remember
and
always
distinguish
the
people
who
can't
bear
things
from
people
who
can
it
will
throw
light
upon
a
number
of
apparently
self
sacrificing
cases
y
m
oh
dear
it's
all
so
disgusting
o
m
yes
and
so
true
y
m
come
take
the
good
boy
who
does
things
he
doesn't
want
to
do
in
order
to
gratify
his
mother
o
m
he
does
seven
tenths
of
the
act
because
it
gratifies
him
to
gratify
his
mother
throw
the
bulk
of
advantage
the
other
way
and
the
good
boy
would
not
do
the
act
he
must
obey
the
iron
law
none
can
escape
it
y
m
well
take
the
case
of
a
bad
boy
who
o
m
you
needn't
mention
it
it
is
a
waste
of
time
it
is
no
matter
about
the
bad
boy's
act
whatever
it
was
he
had
a
spirit
contenting
reason
for
it
otherwise
you
have
been
misinformed
and
he
didn't
do
it
y
m
it
is
very
exasperating
a
while
ago
you
said
that
man's
conscience
is
not
a
born
judge
of
morals
and
conduct
but
has
to
be
taught
and
trained
now
i
think
a
conscience
can
get
drowsy
and
lazy
but
i
don't
think
it
can
go
wrong
if
you
wake
it
up
a
little
story
o
m
i
will
tell
you
a
little
story
once
upon
a
time
an
infidel
was
guest
in
the
house
of
a
christian
widow
whose
little
boy
was
ill
and
near
to
death
the
infidel
often
watched
by
the
bedside
and
entertained
the
boy
with
talk
and
he
used
these
opportunities
to
satisfy
a
strong
longing
in
his
nature
that
desire
which
is
in
us
all
to
better
other
people's
condition
by
having
them
think
as
we
think
he
was
successful
but
the
dying
boy
in
his
last
moments
reproached
him
and
said
i
believed
and
was
happy
in
it
you
have
taken
my
belief
away
and
my
comfort
now
i
have
nothing
left
and
i
die
miserable
for
the
things
which
you
have
told
me
do
not
take
the
place
of
that
which
i
have
lost
and
the
mother
also
reproached
the
infidel
and
said
my
child
is
forever
lost
and
my
heart
is
broken
how
could
you
do
this
cruel
thing
we
have
done
you
no
harm
but
only
kindness
we
made
our
house
your
home
you
were
welcome
to
all
we
had
and
this
is
our
reward
the
heart
of
the
infidel
was
filled
with
remorse
for
what
he
had
done
and
he
said
it
was
wrong
i
see
it
now
but
i
was
only
trying
to
do
him
good
in
my
view
he
was
in
error
it
seemed
my
duty
to
teach
him
the
truth
then
the
mother
said
i
had
taught
him
all
his
little
life
what
i
believed
to
be
the
truth
and
in
his
believing
faith
both
of
us
were
happy
now
he
is
dead
and
lost
and
i
am
miserable
our
faith
came
down
to
us
through
centuries
of
believing
ancestors
what
right
had
you
or
any
one
to
disturb
it
where
was
your
honor
where
was
your
shame
y
m
he
was
a
miscreant
and
deserved
death
o
m
he
thought
so
himself
and
said
so
y
m
ah
you
see
his
conscience
was
awakened
o
m
yes
his
self
disapproval
was
it
pained
him
to
see
the
mother
suffer
he
was
sorry
he
had
done
a
thing
which
brought
him
pain
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
think
of
the
mother
when
he
was
misteaching
the
boy
for
he
was
absorbed
in
providing
pleasure
for
himself
then
providing
it
by
satisfying
what
he
believed
to
be
a
call
of
duty
y
m
call
it
what
you
please
it
is
to
me
a
case
of
awakened
conscience
that
awakened
conscience
could
never
get
itself
into
that
species
of
trouble
again
a
cure
like
that
is
a
permanent
cure
o
m
pardon
i
had
not
finished
the
story
we
are
creatures
of
outside
influences
we
originate
nothing
within
whenever
we
take
a
new
line
of
thought
and
drift
into
a
new
line
of
belief
and
action
the
impulse
is
always
suggested
from
the
outside
remorse
so
preyed
upon
the
infidel
that
it
dissolved
his
harshness
toward
the
boy's
religion
and
made
him
come
to
regard
it
with
tolerance
next
with
kindness
for
the
boy's
sake
and
the
mother's
finally
he
found
himself
examining
it
from
that
moment
his
progress
in
his
new
trend
was
steady
and
rapid
he
became
a
believing
christian
and
now
his
remorse
for
having
robbed
the
dying
boy
of
his
faith
and
his
salvation
was
bitterer
than
ever
it
gave
him
no
rest
no
peace
he
must
have
rest
and
peace
it
is
the
law
of
nature
there
seemed
but
one
way
to
get
it
he
must
devote
himself
to
saving
imperiled
souls
he
became
a
missionary
he
landed
in
a
pagan
country
ill
and
helpless
a
native
widow
took
him
into
her
humble
home
and
nursed
him
back
to
convalescence
then
her
young
boy
was
taken
hopelessly
ill
and
the
grateful
missionary
helped
her
tend
him
here
was
his
first
opportunity
to
repair
a
part
of
the
wrong
done
to
the
other
boy
by
doing
a
precious
service
for
this
one
by
undermining
his
foolish
faith
in
his
false
gods
he
was
successful
but
the
dying
boy
in
his
last
moments
reproached
him
and
said
i
believed
and
was
happy
in
it
you
have
taken
my
belief
away
and
my
comfort
now
i
have
nothing
left
and
i
die
miserable
for
the
things
which
you
have
told
me
do
not
take
the
place
of
that
which
i
have
lost
and
the
mother
also
reproached
the
missionary
and
said
my
child
is
forever
lost
and
my
heart
is
broken
how
could
you
do
this
cruel
thing
we
had

what
right
had

where

where
was

the
missionary's
anguish
of
remorse
and
sense
of
treachery
were
as
bitter
and
persecuting
and
unappeasable
now
as
they
had
been
in
the
former
case
the
story
is
finished
what
is
your
comment
y
m
the
man's
conscience
is
a
fool
it
was
morbid
it
didn't
know
right
from
wrong
o
m
i
am
not
sorry
to
hear
you
say
that
if
you
grant
that
one
man's
conscience
doesn't
know
right
from
wrong
it
is
an
admission
that
there
are
others
like
it
this
single
admission
pulls
down
the
whole
doctrine
of
infallibility
of
judgment
in
consciences
meantime
there
is
one
thing
which
i
ask
you
to
notice
y
m
what
is
that
o
m
that
in
both
cases
the
man's
act
gave
him
no
spiritual
discomfort
and
that
he
was
quite
satisfied
with
it
and
got
pleasure
out
of
it
but
afterward
when
it
resulted
in
pain
to
him
he
was
sorry
sorry
it
had
inflicted
pain
upon
the
others
but
for
no
reason
under
the
sun
except
that
their
pain
gave
him
pain
our
consciences
take
no
notice
of
pain
inflicted
upon
others
until
it
reaches
a
point
where
it
gives
pain
to
us
in
all
cases
without
exception
we
are
absolutely
indifferent
to
another
person's
pain
until
his
sufferings
make
us
uncomfortable
many
an
infidel
would
not
have
been
troubled
by
that
christian
mother's
distress
don't
you
believe
that
y
m
yes
you
might
almost
say
it
of
the
average
infidel
i
think
o
m
and
many
a
missionary
sternly
fortified
by
his
sense
of
duty
would
not
have
been
troubled
by
the
pagan
mother's
distress
jesuit
missionaries
in
canada
in
the
early
french
times
for
instance
see
episodes
quoted
by
parkman
y
m
well
let
us
adjourn
where
have
we
arrived
o
m
at
this
that
we
mankind
have
ticketed
ourselves
with
a
number
of
qualities
to
which
we
have
given
misleading
names
love
hate
charity
compassion
avarice
benevolence
and
so
on
i
mean
we
attach
misleading
meanings
to
the
names
they
are
all
forms
of
self
contentment
self
gratification
but
the
names
so
disguise
them
that
they
distract
our
attention
from
the
fact
also
we
have
smuggled
a
word
into
the
dictionary
which
ought
not
to
be
there
at
all
self
sacrifice
it
describes
a
thing
which
does
not
exist
but
worst
of
all
we
ignore
and
never
mention
the
sole
impulse
which
dictates
and
compels
a
man's
every
act
the
imperious
necessity
of
securing
his
own
approval
in
every
emergency
and
at
all
costs
to
it
we
owe
all
that
we
are
it
is
our
breath
our
heart
our
blood
it
is
our
only
spur
our
whip
our
goad
our
only
impelling
power
we
have
no
other
without
it
we
should
be
mere
inert
images
corpses
no
one
would
do
anything
there
would
be
no
progress
the
world
would
stand
still
we
ought
to
stand
reverently
uncovered
when
the
name
of
that
stupendous
power
is
uttered
y
m
i
am
not
convinced
o
m
you
will
be
when
you
think
iii
instances
in
point
old
man
have
you
given
thought
to
the
gospel
of
self
approval
since
we
talked
young
man
i
have
o
m
it
was
i
that
moved
you
to
it
that
is
to
say
an
outside
influence
moved
you
to
it
not
one
that
originated
in
your
head
will
you
try
to
keep
that
in
mind
and
not
forget
it
y
m
yes
why
o
m
because
by
and
by
in
one
of
our
talks
i
wish
to
further
impress
upon
you
that
neither
you
nor
i
nor
any
man
ever
originates
a
thought
in
his
own
head
the
utterer
of
a
thought
always
utters
a
second
hand
one
y
m
oh
now
o
m
wait
reserve
your
remark
till
we
get
to
that
part
of
our
discussion
tomorrow
or
next
day
say
now
then
have
you
been
considering
the
proposition
that
no
act
is
ever
born
of
any
but
a
self
contenting
impulse
primarily
you
have
sought
what
have
you
found
y
m
i
have
not
been
very
fortunate
i
have
examined
many
fine
and
apparently
self
sacrificing
deeds
in
romances
and
biographies
but
o
m
under
searching
analysis
the
ostensible
self
sacrifice
disappeared
it
naturally
would
y
m
but
here
in
this
novel
is
one
which
seems
to
promise
in
the
adirondack
woods
is
a
wage
earner
and
lay
preacher
in
the
lumber
camps
who
is
of
noble
character
and
deeply
religious
an
earnest
and
practical
laborer
in
the
new
york
slums
comes
up
there
on
vacation
he
is
leader
of
a
section
of
the
university
settlement
holme
the
lumberman
is
fired
with
a
desire
to
throw
away
his
excellent
worldly
prospects
and
go
down
and
save
souls
on
the
east
side
he
counts
it
happiness
to
make
this
sacrifice
for
the
glory
of
god
and
for
the
cause
of
christ
he
resigns
his
place
makes
the
sacrifice
cheerfully
and
goes
to
the
east
side
and
preaches
christ
and
him
crucified
every
day
and
every
night
to
little
groups
of
half
civilized
foreign
paupers
who
scoff
at
him
but
he
rejoices
in
the
scoffings
since
he
is
suffering
them
in
the
great
cause
of
christ
you
have
so
filled
my
mind
with
suspicions
that
i
was
constantly
expecting
to
find
a
hidden
questionable
impulse
back
of
all
this
but
i
am
thankful
to
say
i
have
failed
this
man
saw
his
duty
and
for
duty's
sake
he
sacrificed
self
and
assumed
the
burden
it
imposed
o
m
is
that
as
far
as
you
have
read
y
m
yes
o
m
let
us
read
further
presently
meantime
in
sacrificing
himself
not
for
the
glory
of
god
primarily
as
he
imagined
but
first
to
content
that
exacting
and
inflexible
master
within
him
did
he
sacrifice
anybody
else
y
m
how
do
you
mean
o
m
he
relinquished
a
lucrative
post
and
got
mere
food
and
lodging
in
place
of
it
had
he
dependents
y
m
well
yes
o
m
in
what
way
and
to
what
extend
did
his
self
sacrifice
affect
them
y
m
he
was
the
support
of
a
superannuated
father
he
had
a
young
sister
with
a
remarkable
voice
he
was
giving
her
a
musical
education
so
that
her
longing
to
be
self
supporting
might
be
gratified
he
was
furnishing
the
money
to
put
a
young
brother
through
a
polytechnic
school
and
satisfy
his
desire
to
become
a
civil
engineer
o

the
old
father's
comforts
were
now
curtailed
y
m
quite
seriously
yes

the
sister's
music
lessens

to
stop

education

an
extinguishing
blight
fell
upon
that
happy
dream
and
he
had
to
go
to
sawing
wood
to
support
the
old
father
or
something
like
that
y
m
it
is
about
what
happened
yes
o
m
what
a
handsome
job
of
self
sacrificing
he
did
do
it
seems
to
me
that
he
sacrificed
everybody
except
himself
haven't
i
told
you
that
no
man
ever
sacrifices
himself
that
there
is
no
instance
of
it
upon
record
anywhere
and
that
when
a
man's
interior
monarch
requires
a
thing
of
its
slave
for
either
its
momentary
or
its
permanent
contentment
that
thing
must
and
will
be
furnished
and
that
command
obeyed
no
matter
who
may
stand
in
the
way
and
suffer
disaster
by
it
that
man
ruined
his
family
to
please
and
content
his
interior
monarch
y
m
and
help
christ's
cause
o
m
yes
secondly
not
firstly
he
thought
it
was
firstly
y
m
very
well
have
it
so
if
you
will
but
it
could
be
that
he
argued
that
if
he
saved
a
hundred
souls
in
new
york
o
m
the
sacrifice
of
the
family
would
be
justified
by
that
great
profit
upon
the
the
what
shall
we
call
it
y
m
investment
o
m
hardly
how
would
speculation
do
how
would
gamble
do
not
a
solitary
soul
capture
was
sure
he
played
for
a
possible
thirty
three
hundred
per
cent
profit
it
was
gambling
with
his
family
for
chips
however
let
us
see
how
the
game
came
out
maybe
we
can
get
on
the
track
of
the
secret
original
impulse
the
real
impulse
that
moved
him
to
so
nobly
self
sacrifice
his
family
in
the
savior's
cause
under
the
superstition
that
he
was
sacrificing
himself
i
will
read
a
chapter
or
so
here
we
have
it
it
was
bound
to
expose
itself
sooner
or
later
he
preached
to
the
east
side
rabble
a
season
then
went
back
to
his
old
dull
obscure
life
in
the
lumber
camps
hurt
to
the
heart
his
pride
humbled
why
were
not
his
efforts
acceptable
to
the
savior
for
whom
alone
they
were
made
dear
me
that
detail
is
lost
sight
of
is
not
even
referred
to
the
fact
that
it
started
out
as
a
motive
is
entirely
forgotten
then
what
is
the
trouble
the
authoress
quite
innocently
and
unconsciously
gives
the
whole
business
away
the
trouble
was
this
this
man
merely
preached
to
the
poor
that
is
not
the
university
settlement's
way
it
deals
in
larger
and
better
things
than
that
and
it
did
not
enthuse
over
that
crude
salvation
army
eloquence
it
was
courteous
to
holme
but
cool
it
did
not
pet
him
did
not
take
him
to
its
bosom
perished
were
all
his
dreams
of
distinction
the
praise
and
grateful
approval
of
whom
the
savior
no
the
savior
is
not
mentioned
of
whom
then
of
his
fellow
workers
why
did
he
want
that
because
the
master
inside
of
him
wanted
it
and
would
not
be
content
without
it
that
emphasized
sentence
quoted
above
reveals
the
secret
we
have
been
seeking
the
original
impulse
the
real
impulse
which
moved
the
obscure
and
unappreciated
adirondack
lumberman
to
sacrifice
his
family
and
go
on
that
crusade
to
the
east
side
which
said
original
impulse
was
this
to
wit
without
knowing
it
he
went
there
to
show
a
neglected
world
the
large
talent
that
was
in
him
and
rise
to
distinction
as
i
have
warned
you
before
no
act
springs
from
any
but
the
one
law
the
one
motive
but
i
pray
you
do
not
accept
this
law
upon
my
say
so
but
diligently
examine
for
yourself
whenever
you
read
of
a
self
sacrificing
act
or
hear
of
one
or
of
a
duty
done
for
duty's
sake
take
it
to
pieces
and
look
for
the
real
motive
it
is
always
there
y
m
i
do
it
every
day
i
cannot
help
it
now
that
i
have
gotten
started
upon
the
degrading
and
exasperating
quest
for
it
is
hatefully
interesting
in
fact
fascinating
is
the
word
as
soon
as
i
come
across
a
golden
deed
in
a
book
i
have
to
stop
and
take
it
apart
and
examine
it
i
cannot
help
myself
o
m
have
you
ever
found
one
that
defeated
the
rule
y
m
no
at
least
not
yet
but
take
the
case
of
servant
tipping
in
europe
you
pay
the
hotel
for
service
you
owe
the
servants
nothing
yet
you
pay
them
besides
doesn't
that
defeat
it
o
m
in
what
way
y
m
you
are
not
obliged
to
do
it
therefore
its
source
is
compassion
for
their
ill
paid
condition
and
o
m
has
that
custom
ever
vexed
you
annoyed
you
irritated
you
y
m
well
yes
o
m
still
you
succumbed
to
it
y
m
of
course
o
m
why
of
course
y
m
well
custom
is
law
in
a
way
and
laws
must
be
submitted
to
everybody
recognizes
it
as
a
duty
o
m
then
you
pay
for
the
irritating
tax
for
duty's
sake
y
m
i
suppose
it
amounts
to
that
o
m
then
the
impulse
which
moves
you
to
submit
to
the
tax
is
not
all
compassion
charity
benevolence
y
m
well
perhaps
not
o
m
is
any
of
it
y
m
i
perhaps
i
was
too
hasty
in
locating
its
source
o
m
perhaps
so
in
case
you
ignored
the
custom
would
you
get
prompt
and
effective
service
from
the
servants
y
m
oh
hear
yourself
talk
those
european
servants
why
you
wouldn't
get
any
at
all
to
speak
of
o
m
couldn't
that
work
as
an
impulse
to
move
you
to
pay
the
tax
y
m
i
am
not
denying
it
o
m
apparently
then
it
is
a
case
of
for
duty's
sake
with
a
little
self
interest
added
y
m
yes
it
has
the
look
of
it
but
here
is
a
point
we
pay
that
tax
knowing
it
to
be
unjust
and
an
extortion
yet
we
go
away
with
a
pain
at
the
heart
if
we
think
we
have
been
stingy
with
the
poor
fellows
and
we
heartily
wish
we
were
back
again
so
that
we
could
do
the
right
thing
and
more
than
the
right
thing
the
generous
thing
i
think
it
will
be
difficult
for
you
to
find
any
thought
of
self
in
that
impulse
o
m
i
wonder
why
you
should
think
so
when
you
find
service
charged
in
the
hotel
bill
does
it
annoy
you
y
m
no
o
m
do
you
ever
complain
of
the
amount
of
it
y
m
no
it
would
not
occur
to
me
o
m
the
expense
then
is
not
the
annoying
detail
it
is
a
fixed
charge
and
you
pay
it
cheerfully
you
pay
it
without
a
murmur
when
you
came
to
pay
the
servants
how
would
you
like
it
if
each
of
the
men
and
maids
had
a
fixed
charge
y
m
like
it
i
should
rejoice
o
m
even
if
the
fixed
tax
were
a
shade
more
than
you
had
been
in
the
habit
of
paying
in
the
form
of
tips
y
m
indeed
yes
o
m
very
well
then
as
i
understand
it
it
isn't
really
compassion
nor
yet
duty
that
moves
you
to
pay
the
tax
and
it
isn't
the
amount
of
the
tax
that
annoys
you
yet
something
annoys
you
what
is
it
y
m
well
the
trouble
is
you
never
know
what
to
pay
the
tax
varies
so
all
over
europe
o
m
so
you
have
to
guess
y
m
there
is
no
other
way
so
you
go
on
thinking
and
thinking
and
calculating
and
guessing
and
consulting
with
other
people
and
getting
their
views
and
it
spoils
your
sleep
nights
and
makes
you
distraught
in
the
daytime
and
while
you
are
pretending
to
look
at
the
sights
you
are
only
guessing
and
guessing
and
guessing
all
the
time
and
being
worried
and
miserable
o
m
and
all
about
a
debt
which
you
don't
owe
and
don't
have
to
pay
unless
you
want
to
strange
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
guessing
y
m
to
guess
out
what
is
right
to
give
them
and
not
be
unfair
to
any
of
them
o
m
it
has
quite
a
noble
look
taking
so
much
pains
and
using
up
so
much
valuable
time
in
order
to
be
just
and
fair
to
a
poor
servant
to
whom
you
owe
nothing
but
who
needs
money
and
is
ill
paid
y
m
i
think
myself
that
if
there
is
any
ungracious
motive
back
of
it
it
will
be
hard
to
find
o
m
how
do
you
know
when
you
have
not
paid
a
servant
fairly
y
m
why
he
is
silent
does
not
thank
you
sometimes
he
gives
you
a
look
that
makes
you
ashamed
you
are
too
proud
to
rectify
your
mistake
there
with
people
looking
but
afterward
you
keep
on
wishing
and
wishing
you
had
done
it
my
the
shame
and
the
pain
of
it
sometimes
you
see
by
the
signs
that
you
have
it
just
right
and
you
go
away
mightily
satisfied
sometimes
the
man
is
so
effusively
thankful
that
you
know
you
have
given
him
a
good
deal
more
than
was
necessary
o
m
necessary
necessary
for
what
y
m
to
content
him
o
m
how
do
you
feel
then
y
m
repentant
o
m
it
is
my
belief
that
you
have
not
been
concerning
yourself
in
guessing
out
his
just
dues
but
only
in
ciphering
out
what
would
content
him
and
i
think
you
have
a
self
deluding
reason
for
that
y
m
what
was
it
o
m
if
you
fell
short
of
what
he
was
expecting
and
wanting
you
would
get
a
look
which
would
shame
you
before
folk
that
would
give
you
pain
you
for
you
are
only
working
for
yourself
not
him
if
you
gave
him
too
much
you
would
be
ashamed
of
yourself
for
it
and
that
would
give
you
pain
another
case
of
thinking
of
yourself
protecting
yourself
saving
yourself
from
discomfort
you
never
think
of
the
servant
once
except
to
guess
out
how
to
get
his
approval
if
you
get
that
you
get
your
own
approval
and
that
is
the
sole
and
only
thing
you
are
after
the
master
inside
of
you
is
then
satisfied
contented
comfortable
there
was
no
other
thing
at
stake
as
a
matter
of
first
interest
anywhere
in
the
transaction
further
instances
y
m
well
to
think
of
it
self
sacrifice
for
others
the
grandest
thing
in
man
ruled
out
non
existent
o
m
are
you
accusing
me
of
saying
that
y
m
why
certainly
o
m
i
haven't
said
it
y
m
what
did
you
say
then
o
m
that
no
man
has
ever
sacrificed
himself
in
the
common
meaning
of
that
phrase
which
is
self
sacrifice
for
another
alone
men
make
daily
sacrifices
for
others
but
it
is
for
their
own
sake
first
the
act
must
content
their
own
spirit
first
the
other
beneficiaries
come
second
y
m
and
the
same
with
duty
for
duty's
sake
o
m
yes
no
man
performs
a
duty
for
mere
duty's
sake
the
act
must
content
his
spirit
first
he
must
feel
better
for
doing
the
duty
than
he
would
for
shirking
it
otherwise
he
will
not
do
it
y
m
take
the
case
of
the
berkeley
castle
o
m
it
was
a
noble
duty
greatly
performed
take
it
to
pieces
and
examine
it
if
you
like
y
m
a
british
troop
ship
crowded
with
soldiers
and
their
wives
and
children
she
struck
a
rock
and
began
to
sink
there
was
room
in
the
boats
for
the
women
and
children
only
the
colonel
lined
up
his
regiment
on
the
deck
and
said
it
is
our
duty
to
die
that
they
may
be
saved
there
was
no
murmur
no
protest
the
boats
carried
away
the
women
and
children
when
the
death
moment
was
come
the
colonel
and
his
officers
took
their
several
posts
the
men
stood
at
shoulder
arms
and
so
as
on
dress
parade
with
their
flag
flying
and
the
drums
beating
they
went
down
a
sacrifice
to
duty
for
duty's
sake
can
you
view
it
as
other
than
that
o
m
it
was
something
as
fine
as
that
as
exalted
as
that
could
you
have
remained
in
those
ranks
and
gone
down
to
your
death
in
that
unflinching
way
y
m
could
i
no
i
could
not
o
m
think
imagine
yourself
there
with
that
watery
doom
creeping
higher
and
higher
around
you
y
m
i
can
imagine
it
i
feel
all
the
horror
of
it
i
could
not
have
endured
it
i
could
not
have
remained
in
my
place
i
know
it
o
m
why
y
m
there
is
no
why
about
it
i
know
myself
and
i
know
i
couldn't
do
it
o
m
but
it
would
be
your
duty
to
do
it
y
m
yes
i
know
but
i
couldn't
o
m
it
was
more
than
thousand
men
yet
not
one
of
them
flinched
some
of
them
must
have
been
born
with
your
temperament
if
they
could
do
that
great
duty
for
duty's
sake
why
not
you
don't
you
know
that
you
could
go
out
and
gather
together
a
thousand
clerks
and
mechanics
and
put
them
on
that
deck
and
ask
them
to
die
for
duty's
sake
and
not
two
dozen
of
them
would
stay
in
the
ranks
to
the
end
y
m
yes
i
know
that
o
m
but
you
train
them
and
put
them
through
a
campaign
or
two
then
they
would
be
soldiers
soldiers
with
a
soldier's
pride
a
soldier's
self
respect
a
soldier's
ideals
they
would
have
to
content
a
soldier's
spirit
then
not
a
clerk's
not
a
mechanic's
they
could
not
content
that
spirit
by
shirking
a
soldier's
duty
could
they
y
m
i
suppose
not
o
m
then
they
would
do
the
duty
not
for
the
duty's
sake
but
for
their
own
sake
primarily
the
duty
was
just
the
same
and
just
as
imperative
when
they
were
clerks
mechanics
raw
recruits
but
they
wouldn't
perform
it
for
that
as
clerks
and
mechanics
they
had
other
ideals
another
spirit
to
satisfy
and
they
satisfied
it
they
had
to
it
is
the
law
training
is
potent
training
toward
higher
and
higher
and
ever
higher
ideals
is
worth
any
man's
thought
and
labor
and
diligence
y
m
consider
the
man
who
stands
by
his
duty
and
goes
to
the
stake
rather
than
be
recreant
to
it
o
m
it
is
his
make
and
his
training
he
has
to
content
the
spirit
that
is
in
him
though
it
cost
him
his
life
another
man
just
as
sincerely
religious
but
of
different
temperament
will
fail
of
that
duty
though
recognizing
it
as
a
duty
and
grieving
to
be
unequal
to
it
but
he
must
content
the
spirit
that
is
in
him
he
cannot
help
it
he
could
not
perform
that
duty
for
duty's
sake
for
that
would
not
content
his
spirit
and
the
contenting
of
his
spirit
must
be
looked
to
first
it
takes
precedence
of
all
other
duties
y
m
take
the
case
of
a
clergyman
of
stainless
private
morals
who
votes
for
a
thief
for
public
office
on
his
own
party's
ticket
and
against
an
honest
man
on
the
other
ticket
o
m
he
has
to
content
his
spirit
he
has
no
public
morals
he
has
no
private
ones
where
his
party's
prosperity
is
at
stake
he
will
always
be
true
to
his
make
and
training
iv
training
young
man
you
keep
using
that
word
training
by
it
do
you
particularly
mean
old
man
study
instruction
lectures
sermons
that
is
a
part
of
it
but
not
a
large
part
i
mean
all
the
outside
influences
there
are
a
million
of
them
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
during
all
his
waking
hours
the
human
being
is
under
training
in
the
very
first
rank
of
his
trainers
stands
association
it
is
his
human
environment
which
influences
his
mind
and
his
feelings
furnishes
him
his
ideals
and
sets
him
on
his
road
and
keeps
him
in
it
if
he
that
road
he
will
find
himself
shunned
by
the
people
whom
he
most
loves
and
esteems
and
whose
approval
he
most
values
he
is
a
chameleon
by
the
law
of
his
nature
he
takes
the
color
of
his
place
of
resort
the
influences
about
him
create
his
preferences
his
aversions
his
politics
his
tastes
his
morals
his
religion
he
creates
none
of
these
things
for
himself
he
thinks
he
does
but
that
is
because
he
has
not
examined
into
the
matter
you
have
seen
presbyterians
y
m
many
o
m
how
did
they
happen
to
be
presbyterians
and
not
congregationalists
and
why
were

you
may
answer
your
question
yourself
o
m
that
list
of
sects
is
not
a
record
of
studies
searchings
seekings
after
light
it
mainly
and
sarcastically
indicates
what
association
can
do
if
you
know
a
man's
nationality
you
can
come
within
a
split
hair
of
guessing
the
complexion
of
his
religion
english
protestant
american
ditto
spaniard
frenchman
irishman
italian
south
american
roman
catholic
russian
greek
catholic
turk
mohammedan
and
so
on
and
when
you
know
the
man's
religious
complexion
you
know
what
sort
of
religious
books
he
reads
when
he
wants
some
more
light
and
what
sort
of
books
he
avoids
lest
by
accident
he
get
more
light
than
he
wants
in
america
if
you
know
which
party
collar
a
voter
wears
you
know
what
his
associations
are
and
how
he
came
by
his
politics
and
which
breed
of
newspaper
he
reads
to
get
light
and
which
breed
he
diligently
avoids
and
which
breed
of
mass
meetings
he
attends
in
order
to
broaden
his
political
knowledge
and
which
breed
of
mass
meetings
he
doesn't
attend
except
to
refute
its
doctrines
with
brickbats
we
are
always
hearing
of
people
who
are
around
seeking
after
truth
i
have
never
seen
a
permanent
specimen
i
think
he
had
never
lived
but
i
have
seen
several
entirely
sincere
people
who
thought
they
were
permanent
seekers
after
truth
they
sought
diligently
persistently
carefully
cautiously
profoundly
with
perfect
honesty
and
nicely
adjusted
judgment
until
they
believed
that
without
doubt
or
question
they
had
found
the
truth
that
was
the
end
of
the
search
the
man
spent
the
rest
of
his
life
hunting
up
shingles
wherewith
to
protect
his
truth
from
the
weather
if
he
was
seeking
after
political
truth
he
found
it
in
one
or
another
of
the
hundred
political
gospels
which
govern
men
in
the
earth
if
he
was
seeking
after
the
only
true
religion
he
found
it
in
one
or
another
of
the
three
thousand
that
are
on
the
market
in
any
case
when
he
found
the
truth
he
sought
no
further
but
from
that
day
forth
with
his
soldering
iron
in
one
hand
and
his
bludgeon
in
the
other
he
tinkered
its
leaks
and
reasoned
with
objectors
there
have
been
innumerable
temporary
seekers
of
truth
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
permanent
one
in
the
very
nature
of
man
such
a
person
is
impossible
however
to
drop
back
to
the
text
training
all
training
is
one
form
or
another
of
outside
influence
and
association
is
the
largest
part
of
it
a
man
is
never
anything
but
what
his
outside
influences
have
made
him
they
train
him
downward
or
they
train
him
upward
but
they
train
him
they
are
at
work
upon
him
all
the
time
y
m
then
if
he
happen
by
the
accidents
of
life
to
be
evilly
placed
there
is
no
help
for
him
according
to
your
notions
he
must
train
downward
o
m
no
help
for
him
no
help
for
this
chameleon
it
is
a
mistake
it
is
in
his
chameleonship
that
his
greatest
good
fortune
lies
he
has
only
to
change
his
habitat
his
associations
but
the
impulse
to
do
it
must
come
from
the
outside
he
cannot
originate
it
himself
with
that
purpose
in
view
sometimes
a
very
small
and
accidental
thing
can
furnish
him
the
initiatory
impulse
and
start
him
on
a
new
road
with
a
new
idea
the
chance
remark
of
a
sweetheart
i
hear
that
you
are
a
coward
may
water
a
seed
that
shall
sprout
and
bloom
and
flourish
and
ended
in
producing
a
surprising
fruitage
in
the
fields
of
war
the
history
of
man
is
full
of
such
accidents
the
accident
of
a
broken
leg
brought
a
profane
and
ribald
soldier
under
religious
influences
and
furnished
him
a
new
ideal
from
that
accident
sprang
the
order
of
the
jesuits
and
it
has
been
shaking
thrones
changing
policies
and
doing
other
tremendous
work
for
two
hundred
years
and
will
go
on
the
chance
reading
of
a
book
or
of
a
paragraph
in
a
newspaper
can
start
a
man
on
a
new
track
and
make
him
renounce
his
old
associations
and
seek
new
ones
that
are
in
sympathy
with
his
new
ideal
and
the
result
for
that
man
can
be
an
entire
change
of
his
way
of
life
y
m
are
you
hinting
at
a
scheme
of
procedure
o
m
not
a
new
one
an
old
one
old
as
mankind
y
m
what
is
it
o
m
merely
the
laying
of
traps
for
people
traps
baited
with
initiatory
impulses
toward
high
ideals
it
is
what
the
tract
distributor
does
it
is
what
the
missionary
does
it
is
what
governments
ought
to
do
y
m
don't
they
o
m
in
one
way
they
do
in
another
they
don't
they
separate
the
smallpox
patients
from
the
healthy
people
but
in
dealing
with
crime
they
put
the
healthy
into
the
pest
house
along
with
the
sick
that
is
to
say
they
put
the
beginners
in
with
the
confirmed
criminals
this
would
be
well
if
man
were
naturally
inclined
to
good
but
he
isn't
and
so
association
makes
the
beginners
worse
than
they
were
when
they
went
into
captivity
it
is
putting
a
very
severe
punishment
upon
the
comparatively
innocent
at
times
they
hang
a
man
which
is
a
trifling
punishment
this
breaks
the
hearts
of
his
family
which
is
a
heavy
one
they
comfortably
jail
and
feed
a
wife
beater
and
leave
his
innocent
wife
and
family
to
starve
y
m
do
you
believe
in
the
doctrine
that
man
is
equipped
with
an
intuitive
perception
of
good
and
evil
o
m
adam
hadn't
it
y
m
but
has
man
acquired
it
since
o
m
no
i
think
he
has
no
intuitions
of
any
kind
he
gets
all
his
ideas
all
his
impressions
from
the
outside
i
keep
repeating
this
in
the
hope
that
i
may
impress
it
upon
you
that
you
will
be
interested
to
observe
and
examine
for
yourself
and
see
whether
it
is
true
or
false
y
m
where
did
you
get
your
own
aggravating
notions
o
m
from
the
outside
i
did
not
invent
them
they
are
gathered
from
a
thousand
unknown
sources
mainly
unconsciously
gathered
y
m
don't
you
believe
that
god
could
make
an
inherently
honest
man
o
m
yes
i
know
he
could
i
also
know
that
he
never
did
make
one
y
m
a
wiser
observer
than
you
has
recorded
the
fact
that
an
honest
man's
the
noblest
work
of
god
o
m
he
didn't
record
a
fact
he
recorded
a
falsity
it
is
windy
and
sounds
well
but
it
is
not
true
god
makes
a
man
with
honest
and
dishonest
possibilities
in
him
and
stops
there
the
man's
associations
develop
the
possibilities
the
one
set
or
the
other
the
result
is
accordingly
an
honest
man
or
a
dishonest
one
y
m
and
the
honest
one
is
not
entitled
to
o
m
praise
no
how
often
must
i
tell
you
that
he
is
not
the
architect
of
his
honesty
y
m
now
then
i
will
ask
you
where
there
is
any
sense
in
training
people
to
lead
virtuous
lives
what
is
gained
by
it
o
m
the
man
himself
gets
large
advantages
out
of
it
and
that
is
the
main
thing
to
him
he
is
not
a
peril
to
his
neighbors
he
is
not
a
damage
to
them
and
so
they
get
an
advantage
out
of
his
virtues
that
is
the
main
thing
to
them
it
can
make
this
life
comparatively
comfortable
to
the
parties
concerned
the
neglect
of
this
training
can
make
this
life
a
constant
peril
and
distress
to
the
parties
concerned
y
m
you
have
said
that
training
is
everything
that
training
is
the
man
himself
for
it
makes
him
what
he
is
o
m
i
said
training
and
another
thing
let
that
other
thing
pass
for
the
moment
what
were
you
going
to
say
y
m
we
have
an
old
servant
she
has
been
with
us
twenty
two
years
her
service
used
to
be
faultless
but
now
she
has
become
very
forgetful
we
are
all
fond
of
her
we
all
recognize
that
she
cannot
help
the
infirmity
which
age
has
brought
her
the
rest
of
the
family
do
not
scold
her
for
her
remissnesses
but
at
times
i
do
i
can't
seem
to
control
myself
don't
i
try
i
do
try
now
then
when
i
was
ready
to
dress
this
morning
no
clean
clothes
had
been
put
out
i
lost
my
temper
i
lose
it
easiest
and
quickest
in
the
early
morning
i
rang
and
immediately
began
to
warn
myself
not
to
show
temper
and
to
be
careful
and
speak
gently
i
safe
guarded
myself
most
carefully
i
even
chose
the
very
word
i
would
use
you've
forgotten
the
clean
clothes
jane
when
she
appeared
in
the
door
i
opened
my
mouth
to
say
that
phrase
and
out
of
it
moved
by
an
instant
surge
of
passion
which
i
was
not
expecting
and
hadn't
time
to
put
under
control
came
the
hot
rebuke
you've
forgotten
them
again
you
say
a
man
always
does
the
thing
which
will
best
please
his
interior
master
whence
came
the
impulse
to
make
careful
preparation
to
save
the
girl
the
humiliation
of
a
rebuke
did
that
come
from
the
master
who
is
always
primarily
concerned
about
himself
o
m
unquestionably
there
is
no
other
source
for
any
impulse
secondarily
you
made
preparation
to
save
the
girl
but
primarily
its
object
was
to
save
yourself
by
contenting
the
master
y
m
how
do
you
mean
o
m
has
any
member
of
the
family
ever
implored
you
to
watch
your
temper
and
not
fly
out
at
the
girl
y
m
yes
my
mother
o
m
you
love
her
y
m
oh
more
than
that
o
m
you
would
always
do
anything
in
your
power
to
please
her
y
m
it
is
a
delight
to
me
to
do
anything
to
please
her
o
m
why
you
would
do
it
for
pay
solely
for
profit
what
profit
would
you
expect
and
certainly
receive
from
the
investment
y
m
personally
none
to
please
her
is
enough
o
m
it
appears
then
that
your
object
primarily
wasn't
to
save
the
girl
a
humiliation
but
to
please
your
mother
it
also
appears
that
to
please
your
mother
gives
you
a
strong
pleasure
is
not
that
the
profit
which
you
get
out
of
the
investment
isn't
that
the
real
profits
and
first
profit
y
m
oh
well
go
on
o
m
in
all
transactions
the
interior
master
looks
to
it
that
you
get
the
first
profit
otherwise
there
is
no
transaction
y
m
well
then
if
i
was
so
anxious
to
get
that
profit
and
so
intent
upon
it
why
did
i
throw
it
away
by
losing
my
temper
o
m
in
order
to
get
another
profit
which
suddenly
superseded
it
in
value
y
m
where
was
it
o
m
ambushed
behind
your
born
temperament
and
waiting
for
a
chance
your
native
warm
temper
suddenly
jumped
to
the
front
and
for
the
moment
its
influence
was
more
powerful
than
your
mother's
and
abolished
it
in
that
instance
you
were
eager
to
flash
out
a
hot
rebuke
and
enjoy
it
you
did
enjoy
it
didn't
you
y
m
for
for
a
quarter
of
a
second
yes
i
did
o
m
very
well
it
is
as
i
have
said
the
thing
which
will
give
you
the
most
pleasure
the
most
satisfaction
in
any
moment
or
fraction
of
a
moment
is
the
thing
you
will
always
do
you
must
content
the
master's
latest
whim
whatever
it
may
be
y
m
but
when
the
tears
came
into
the
old
servant's
eyes
i
could
have
cut
my
hand
off
for
what
i
had
done
o
m
right
you
had
humiliated
yourself
you
see
you
had
given
yourself
pain
nothing
is
of
first
importance
to
a
man
except
results
which
damage
him
or
profit
him
all
the
rest
is
secondary
your
master
was
displeased
with
you
although
you
had
obeyed
him
he
required
a
prompt
repentance
you
obeyed
again
you
had
to
there
is
never
any
escape
from
his
commands
he
is
a
hard
master
and
fickle
he
changes
his
mind
in
the
fraction
of
a
second
but
you
must
be
ready
to
obey
and
you
will
obey
always
if
he
requires
repentance
you
content
him
you
will
always
furnish
it
he
must
be
nursed
petted
coddled
and
kept
contented
let
the
terms
be
what
they
may
y
m
training
oh
what's
the
use
of
it
didn't
i
and
didn't
my
mother
try
to
train
me
up
to
where
i
would
no
longer
fly
out
at
that
girl
o
m
have
you
never
managed
to
keep
back
a
scolding
y
m
oh
certainly
many
times
o
m
more
times
this
year
than
last
y
m
yes
a
good
many
more
o
m
more
times
last
year
than
the
year
before
y
m
yes
o
m
there
is
a
large
improvement
then
in
the
two
years
y
m
yes
undoubtedly
o
m
then
your
question
is
answered
you
see
there
is
use
in
training
keep
on
keeping
faithfully
on
you
are
doing
well
y
m
will
my
reform
reach
perfection
o
m
it
will
up
to
your
limit
y
m
my
limit
what
do
you
mean
by
that
o
m
you
remember
that
you
said
that
i
said
training
was
everything
i
corrected
you
and
said
training
and
another
thing
that
other
thing
is
temperament
that
is
the
disposition
you
were
born
with
you
can't
eradicate
your
disposition
nor
any
rag
of
it
you
can
only
put
a
pressure
on
it
and
keep
it
down
and
quiet
you
have
a
warm
temper
y
m
yes
o
m
you
will
never
get
rid
of
it
but
by
watching
it
you
can
keep
it
down
nearly
all
the
time
its
presence
is
your
limit
your
reform
will
never
quite
reach
perfection
for
your
temper
will
beat
you
now
and
then
but
you
come
near
enough
you
have
made
valuable
progress
and
can
make
more
there
is
use
in
training
immense
use
presently
you
will
reach
a
new
stage
of
development
then
your
progress
will
be
easier
will
proceed
on
a
simpler
basis
anyway
y
m
explain
o
m
you
keep
back
your
scoldings
now
to
please
yourself
by
pleasing
your
mother
presently
the
mere
triumphing
over
your
temper
will
delight
your
vanity
and
confer
a
more
delicious
pleasure
and
satisfaction
upon
you
than
even
the
approbation
of
your
mother
confers
upon
you
now
you
will
then
labor
for
yourself
directly
and
at
first
hand
not
by
the
roundabout
way
through
your
mother
it
simplifies
the
matter
and
it
also
strengthens
the
impulse
y
m
ah
dear
but
i
sha'n't
ever
reach
the
point
where
i
will
spare
the
girl
for
her
sake
primarily
not
mine
o
m
why
yes
in
heaven
y
m
after
a
reflective
pause
temperament
well
i
see
one
must
allow
for
temperament
it
is
a
large
factor
sure
enough
my
mother
is
thoughtful
and
not
hot
tempered
when
i
was
dressed
i
went
to
her
room
she
was
not
there
i
called
she
answered
from
the
bathroom
i
heard
the
water
running
i
inquired
she
answered
without
temper
that
jane
had
forgotten
her
bath
and
she
was
preparing
it
herself
i
offered
to
ring
but
she
said
no
don't
do
that
it
would
only
distress
her
to
be
confronted
with
her
lapse
and
would
be
a
rebuke
she
doesn't
deserve
that
she
is
not
to
blame
for
the
tricks
her
memory
serves
her
i
say
has
my
mother
an
interior
master
and
where
was
he
o
m
he
was
there
there
and
looking
out
for
his
own
peace
and
pleasure
and
contentment
the
girl's
distress
would
have
pained
your
mother
otherwise
the
girl
would
have
been
rung
up
distress
and
all
i
know
women
who
would
have
gotten
a
no
pleasure
out
of
ringing
jane
up
and
so
they
would
infallibly
have
pushed
the
button
and
obeyed
the
law
of
their
make
and
training
which
are
the
servants
of
their
interior
masters
it
is
quite
likely
that
a
part
of
your
mother's
forbearance
came
from
training
the
good
kind
of
training
whose
best
and
highest
function
is
to
see
to
it
that
every
time
it
confers
a
satisfaction
upon
its
pupil
a
benefit
shall
fall
at
second
hand
upon
others
y
m
if
you
were
going
to
condense
into
an
admonition
your
plan
for
the
general
betterment
of
the
race's
condition
how
would
you
word
it
admonition
o
m
diligently
train
your
ideals
upward
and
still
upward
toward
a
summit
where
you
will
find
your
chiefest
pleasure
in
conduct
which
while
contenting
you
will
be
sure
to
confer
benefits
upon
your
neighbor
and
the
community
y
m
is
that
a
new
gospel
o
m
no
y
m
it
has
been
taught
before
o
m
for
ten
thousand
years
y
m
by
whom
o
m
all
the
great
religions
all
the
great
gospels
y
m
then
there
is
nothing
new
about
it
o
m
oh
yes
there
is
it
is
candidly
stated
this
time
that
has
not
been
done
before
y
m
how
do
you
mean
o
m
haven't
i
put
you
first
and
your
neighbor
and
the
community
afterward
y
m
well
yes
that
is
a
difference
it
is
true
o
m
the
difference
between
straight
speaking
and
crooked
the
difference
between
frankness
and
shuffling
y
m
explain
o
m
the
others
offer
you
a
hundred
bribes
to
be
good
thus
conceding
that
the
master
inside
of
you
must
be
conciliated
and
contented
first
and
that
you
will
do
nothing
at
first
hand
but
for
his
sake
then
they
turn
square
around
and
require
you
to
do
good
for
other's
sake
chiefly
and
to
do
your
duty
for
duty's
sake
chiefly
and
to
do
acts
of
self
sacrifice
thus
at
the
outset
we
all
stand
upon
the
same
ground
recognition
of
the
supreme
and
absolute
monarch
that
resides
in
man
and
we
all
grovel
before
him
and
appeal
to
him
then
those
others
dodge
and
shuffle
and
face
around
and
unfrankly
and
inconsistently
and
illogically
change
the
form
of
their
appeal
and
direct
its
persuasions
to
man's
second
place
powers
and
to
powers
which
have
no
existence
in
him
thus
advancing
them
to
first
place
whereas
in
my
admonition
i
stick
logically
and
consistently
to
the
original
position
i
place
the
interior
master's
requirements
first
and
keep
them
there
y
m
if
we
grant
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
your
scheme
and
the
other
schemes
aim
at
and
produce
the
same
result
right
living
has
yours
an
advantage
over
the
others
o
m
one
yes
a
large
one
it
has
no
concealments
no
deceptions
when
a
man
leads
a
right
and
valuable
life
under
it
he
is
not
deceived
as
to
the
real
chief
motive
which
impels
him
to
it
in
those
other
cases
he
is
y
m
is
that
an
advantage
is
it
an
advantage
to
live
a
lofty
life
for
a
mean
reason
in
the
other
cases
he
lives
the
lofty
life
under
the
impression
that
he
is
living
for
a
lofty
reason
is
not
that
an
advantage
o
m
perhaps
so
the
same
advantage
he
might
get
out
of
thinking
himself
a
duke
and
living
a
duke's
life
and
parading
in
ducal
fuss
and
feathers
when
he
wasn't
a
duke
at
all
and
could
find
it
out
if
he
would
only
examine
the
herald's
records
y
m
but
anyway
he
is
obliged
to
do
a
duke's
part
he
puts
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
does
his
benevolences
on
as
big
a
scale
as
he
can
stand
and
that
benefits
the
community
o
m
he
could
do
that
without
being
a
duke
y
m
but
would
he
o
m
don't
you
see
where
you
are
arriving
y
m
where
o
m
at
the
standpoint
of
the
other
schemes
that
it
is
good
morals
to
let
an
ignorant
duke
do
showy
benevolences
for
his
pride's
sake
a
pretty
low
motive
and
go
on
doing
them
unwarned
lest
if
he
were
made
acquainted
with
the
actual
motive
which
prompted
them
he
might
shut
up
his
purse
and
cease
to
be
good
y
m
but
isn't
it
best
to
leave
him
in
ignorance
as
long
as
he
thinks
he
is
doing
good
for
others
sake
o
m
perhaps
so
it
is
the
position
of
the
other
schemes
they
think
humbug
is
good
enough
morals
when
the
dividend
on
it
is
good
deeds
and
handsome
conduct
y
m
it
is
my
opinion
that
under
your
scheme
of
a
man's
doing
a
good
deed
for
his
own
sake
first
off
instead
of
first
for
the
good
deed's
sake
no
man
would
ever
do
one
o
m
have
you
committed
a
benevolence
lately
y
m
yes
this
morning
o
m
give
the
particulars
y
m
the
cabin
of
the
old
negro
woman
who
used
to
nurse
me
when
i
was
a
child
and
who
saved
my
life
once
at
the
risk
of
her
own
was
burned
last
night
and
she
came
mourning
this
morning
and
pleading
for
money
to
build
another
one
o
m
you
furnished
it
y
m
certainly
o
m
you
were
glad
you
had
the
money
y
m
money
i
hadn't
i
sold
my
horse
o
m
you
were
glad
you
had
the
horse
y
m
of
course
i
was
for
if
i
hadn't
had
the
horse
i
should
have
been
incapable
and
my
mother
would
have
captured
the
chance
to
set
old
sally
up
o
m
you
were
cordially
glad
you
were
not
caught
out
and
incapable
y
m
oh
i
just
was
o
m
now
then
y
m
stop
where
you
are
i
know
your
whole
catalog
of
questions
and
i
could
answer
every
one
of
them
without
your
wasting
the
time
to
ask
them
but
i
will
summarize
the
whole
thing
in
a
single
remark
i
did
the
charity
knowing
it
was
because
the
act
would
give
me
a
splendid
pleasure
and
because
old
sally's
moving
gratitude
and
delight
would
give
me
another
one
and
because
the
reflection
that
she
would
be
happy
now
and
out
of
her
trouble
would
fill
me
full
of
happiness
i
did
the
whole
thing
with
my
eyes
open
and
recognizing
and
realizing
that
i
was
looking
out
for
my
share
of
the
profits
first
now
then
i
have
confessed
go
on
o
m
i
haven't
anything
to
offer
you
have
covered
the
whole
ground
can
you
have
been
any
more
strongly
moved
to
help
sally
out
of
her
trouble
could
you
have
done
the
deed
any
more
eagerly
if
you
had
been
under
the
delusion
that
you
were
doing
it
for
her
sake
and
profit
only
y
m
no
nothing
in
the
world
could
have
made
the
impulse
which
moved
me
more
powerful
more
masterful
more
thoroughly
irresistible
i
played
the
limit
o
m
very
well
you
begin
to
suspect
and
i
claim
to
know
that
when
a
man
is
a
shade
more
strongly
moved
to
do
one
of
two
things
or
of
two
dozen
things
than
he
is
to
do
any
one
of
the
others
he
will
infallibly
do
that
one
thing
be
it
good
or
be
it
evil
and
if
it
be
good
not
all
the
beguilements
of
all
the
casuistries
can
increase
the
strength
of
the
impulse
by
a
single
shade
or
add
a
shade
to
the
comfort
and
contentment
he
will
get
out
of
the
act
y
m
then
you
believe
that
such
tendency
toward
doing
good
as
is
in
men's
hearts
would
not
be
diminished
by
the
removal
of
the
delusion
that
good
deeds
are
done
primarily
for
the
sake
of
no
instead
of
for
the
sake
of
no
o
m
that
is
what
i
fully
believe
y
m
doesn't
it
somehow
seem
to
take
from
the
dignity
of
the
deed
o
m
if
there
is
dignity
in
falsity
it
does
it
removes
that
y
m
what
is
left
for
the
moralists
to
do
o
m
teach
unreservedly
what
he
already
teaches
with
one
side
of
his
mouth
and
takes
back
with
the
other
do
right
for
your
own
sake
and
be
happy
in
knowing
that
your
neighbor
will
certainly
share
in
the
benefits
resulting
y
m
repeat
your
admonition
o
m
diligently
train
your
ideals
upward
and
still
upward
toward
a
summit
where
you
will
find
your
chiefest
pleasure
in
conduct
which
while
contenting
you
will
be
sure
to
confer
benefits
upon
your
neighbor
and
the
community
y
m
one's
every
act
proceeds
from
exterior
influences
you
think
o
m
yes
y
m
if
i
conclude
to
rob
a
person
i
am
not
the
originator
of
the
idea
but
it
comes
in
from
the
outside
i
see
him
handling
money
for
instance
and
that
moves
me
to
the
crime
o
m
that
by
itself
oh
certainly
not
it
is
merely
the
latest
outside
influence
of
a
procession
of
preparatory
influences
stretching
back
over
a
period
of
years
no
single
outside
influence
can
make
a
man
do
a
thing
which
is
at
war
with
his
training
the
most
it
can
do
is
to
start
his
mind
on
a
new
tract
and
open
it
to
the
reception
of
new
influences
as
in
the
case
of
ignatius
loyola
in
time
these
influences
can
train
him
to
a
point
where
it
will
be
consonant
with
his
new
character
to
yield
to
the
final
influence
and
do
that
thing
i
will
put
the
case
in
a
form
which
will
make
my
theory
clear
to
you
i
think
here
are
two
ingots
of
virgin
gold
they
shall
represent
a
couple
of
characters
which
have
been
refined
and
perfected
in
the
virtues
by
years
of
diligent
right
training
suppose
you
wanted
to
break
down
these
strong
and
well
compacted
characters
what
influence
would
you
bring
to
bear
upon
the
ingots
y
m
work
it
out
yourself
proceed
o
m
suppose
i
turn
upon
one
of
them
a
steam
jet
during
a
long
succession
of
hours
will
there
be
a
result
y
m
none
that
i
know
of
o
m
why
y
m
a
steam
jet
cannot
break
down
such
a
substance
o
m
very
well
the
steam
is
an
outside
influence
but
it
is
ineffective
because
the
gold
takes
no
interest
in
it
the
ingot
remains
as
it
was
suppose
we
add
to
the
steam
some
quicksilver
in
a
vaporized
condition
and
turn
the
jet
upon
the
ingot
will
there
be
an
instantaneous
result
y
m
no
o
m
the
quicksilver
is
an
outside
influence
which
gold
by
its
peculiar
nature
say
temperament
disposition
cannot
be
indifferent
to
it
stirs
up
the
interest
of
the
gold
although
we
do
not
perceive
it
but
a
single
application
of
the
influence
works
no
damage
let
us
continue
the
application
in
a
steady
stream
and
call
each
minute
a
year
by
the
end
of
ten
or
twenty
minutes
ten
or
twenty
years
the
little
ingot
is
sodden
with
quicksilver
its
virtues
are
gone
its
character
is
degraded
at
last
it
is
ready
to
yield
to
a
temptation
which
it
would
have
taken
no
notice
of
ten
or
twenty
years
ago
we
will
apply
that
temptation
in
the
form
of
a
pressure
of
my
finger
you
note
the
result
y
m
yes
the
ingot
has
crumbled
to
sand
i
understand
now
it
is
not
the
single
outside
influence
that
does
the
work
but
only
the
last
one
of
a
long
and
disintegrating
accumulation
of
them
i
see
now
how
my
single
impulse
to
rob
the
man
is
not
the
one
that
makes
me
do
it
but
only
the
last
one
of
a
preparatory
series
you
might
illustrate
with
a
parable
a
parable
o
m
i
will
there
was
once
a
pair
of
new
england
boys
twins
they
were
alike
in
good
dispositions
feckless
morals
and
personal
appearance
they
were
the
models
of
the
sunday
school
at
fifteen
george
had
the
opportunity
to
go
as
cabin
boy
in
a
whale
ship
and
sailed
away
for
the
pacific
henry
remained
at
home
in
the
village
at
eighteen
george
was
a
sailor
before
the
mast
and
henry
was
teacher
of
the
advanced
bible
class
at
twenty
two
george
through
fighting
habits
and
drinking
habits
acquired
at
sea
and
in
the
sailor
boarding
houses
of
the
european
and
oriental
ports
was
a
common
rough
in
hong
kong
and
out
of
a
job
and
henry
was
superintendent
of
the
sunday
school
at
twenty
six
george
was
a
wanderer
a
tramp
and
henry
was
pastor
of
the
village
church
then
george
came
home
and
was
henry's
guest
one
evening
a
man
passed
by
and
turned
down
the
lane
and
henry
said
with
a
pathetic
smile
without
intending
me
a
discomfort
that
man
is
always
keeping
me
reminded
of
my
pinching
poverty
for
he
carries
heaps
of
money
about
him
and
goes
by
here
every
evening
of
his
life
that
outside
influence
that
remark
was
enough
for
george
but
it
was
not
the
one
that
made
him
ambush
the
man
and
rob
him
it
merely
represented
the
eleven
years
accumulation
of
such
influences
and
gave
birth
to
the
act
for
which
their
long
gestation
had
made
preparation
it
had
never
entered
the
head
of
henry
to
rob
the
man
his
ingot
had
been
subjected
to
clean
steam
only
but
george's
had
been
subjected
to
vaporized
quicksilver
v
more
about
the
machine
note
when
mrs
w
asks
how
can
a
millionaire
give
a
single
dollar
to
colleges
and
museums
while
one
human
being
is
destitute
of
bread
she
has
answered
her
question
herself
her
feeling
for
the
poor
shows
that
she
has
a
standard
of
benevolence
there
she
has
conceded
the
millionaire's
privilege
of
having
a
standard
since
she
evidently
requires
him
to
adopt
her
standard
she
is
by
that
act
requiring
herself
to
adopt
his
the
human
being
always
looks
down
when
he
is
examining
another
person's
standard
he
never
find
one
that
he
has
to
examine
by
looking
up
the
man

again
young
man
you
really

is
a
mere
machine
old
man
i
do
y
m
and
that
his
mind
works
automatically
and
is
independent
of
his
control
carries
on
thought
on
its
own
hook
o
m
yes
it
is
diligently
at
work
unceasingly
at
work
during
every
waking
moment
have
you
never
tossed
about
all
night
imploring
beseeching
commanding
your
mind
to
stop
work
and
let
you
go
to
sleep
you
who
perhaps
imagine
that
your
mind
is
your
servant
and
must
obey
your
orders
think
what
you
tell
it
to
think
and
stop
when
you
tell
it
to
stop
when
it
chooses
to
work
there
is
no
way
to
keep
it
still
for
an
instant
the
brightest
man
would
not
be
able
to
supply
it
with
subjects
if
he
had
to
hunt
them
up
if
it
needed
the
man's
help
it
would
wait
for
him
to
give
it
work
when
he
wakes
in
the
morning
y
m
maybe
it
does
o

no

begins
right
away
before

wide
enough
awake
to
give
it
a
suggestion
he
may
go
to
sleep
saying
the
moment
i
wake
i
will
think
upon
such
and
such
a
subject
but
he
will
fail
his
mind
will
be
too
quick
for
him
by
the
time
he
has
become
nearly
enough
awake
to
be
half
conscious
he
will
find
that
it
is
already
at
work
upon
another
subject
make
the
experiment
and
see
y
m
at
any
rate
he
can
make
it
stick
to
a
subject
if
he
wants
to
o
m
not
if
it
find
another
that
suits
it
better
as
a
rule
it
will
listen
to
neither
a
dull
speaker
nor
a
bright
one
it
refuses
all
persuasion
the
dull
speaker
wearies
it
and
sends
it
far
away
in
idle
dreams
the
bright
speaker
throws
out
stimulating
ideas
which
it
goes
chasing
after
and
is
at
once
unconscious
of
him
and
his
talk
you
cannot
keep
your
mind
from
wandering
if
it
wants
to
it
is
master
not
you
after
an
interval
of
days
o
m
now
dreams
but
we
will
examine
that
later
meantime
did
you
try
commanding
your
mind
to
wait
for
orders
from
you
and
not
do
any
thinking
on
its
own
hook
y
m
yes
i
commanded
it
to
stand
ready
to
take
orders
when
i
should
wake
in
the
morning
o
m
did
it
obey
y
m
no
it
went
to
thinking
of
something
of
its
own
initiation
without
waiting
for
me
also
as
you
suggested
at
night
i
appointed
a
theme
for
it
to
begin
on
in
the
morning
and
commanded
it
to
begin
on
that
one
and
no
other
o
m
did
it
obey
y
m
no
o
m
how
many
times
did
you
try
the
experiment
y
m
ten
o
m
how
many
successes
did
you
score
y
m
not
one
o
m
it
is
as
i
have
said
the
mind
is
independent
of
the
man
he
has
no
control
over
it
it
does
as
it
pleases
it
will
take
up
a
subject
in
spite
of
him
it
will
stick
to
it
in
spite
of
him
it
will
throw
it
aside
in
spite
of
him
it
is
entirely
independent
of
him
y
m
go
on
illustrate
o
m
do
you
know
chess
y
m
i
learned
it
a
week
ago
o
m
did
your
mind
go
on
playing
the
game
all
night
that
first
night
y
m
don't
mention
it
o
m
it
was
eagerly
unsatisfiably
interested
it
rioted
in
the
combinations
you
implored
it
to
drop
the
game
and
let
you
get
some
sleep
y
m
yes
it
wouldn't
listen
it
played
right
along
it
wore
me
out
and
i
got
up
haggard
and
wretched
in
the
morning
o
m
at
some
time
or
other
you
have
been
captivated
by
a
ridiculous
rhyme
jingle
y
m
indeed
yes
i
saw
esau
kissing
kate
and
she
saw
i
saw
esau
i
saw
esau
he
saw
kate
and
she
saw
and
so
on
my
mind
went
mad
with
joy
over
it
it
repeated
it
all
day
and
all
night
for
a
week
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
to
stop
it
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
must
surely
go
crazy
o
m
and
the
new
popular
song
y
m
oh
yes
in
the
swee
eet
by
and
by
etc
yes
the
new
popular
song
with
the
taking
melody
sings
through
one's
head
day
and
night
asleep
and
awake
till
one
is
a
wreck
there
is
no
getting
the
mind
to
let
it
alone
o
m
yes
asleep
as
well
as
awake
the
mind
is
quite
independent
it
is
master
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
is
so
apart
from
you
that
it
can
conduct
its
affairs
sing
its
songs
play
its
chess
weave
its
complex
and
ingeniously
constructed
dreams
while
you
sleep
it
has
no
use
for
your
help
no
use
for
your
guidance
and
never
uses
either
whether
you
be
asleep
or
awake
you
have
imagined
that
you
could
originate
a
thought
in
your
mind
and
you
have
sincerely
believed
you
could
do
it
y
m
yes
i
have
had
that
idea
o
m
yet
you
can't
originate
a
dream
thought
for
it
to
work
out
and
get
it
accepted
y
m
no
o
m
and
you
can't
dictate
its
procedure
after
it
has
originated
a
dream
thought
for
itself
y
m
no
no
one
can
do
it
do
you
think
the
waking
mind
and
the
dream
mind
are
the
same
machine
o
m
there
is
argument
for
it
we
have
wild
and
fantastic
day
thoughts
things
that
are
dream
like
y
m
yes
like
mr
wells's
man
who
invented
a
drug
that
made
him
invisible
and
like
the
arabian
tales
of
the
thousand
nights
o
m
and
there
are
dreams
that
are
rational
simple
consistent
and
unfantastic
y
m
yes
i
have
dreams
that
are
like
that
dreams
that
are
just
like
real
life
dreams
in
which
there
are
several
persons
with
distinctly
differentiated
characters
inventions
of
my
mind
and
yet
strangers
to
me
a
vulgar
person
a
refined
one
a
wise
person
a
fool
a
cruel
person
a
kind
and
compassionate
one
a
quarrelsome
person
a
peacemaker
old
persons
and
young
beautiful
girls
and
homely
ones
they
talk
in
character
each
preserves
his
own
characteristics
there
are
vivid
fights
vivid
and
biting
insults
vivid
love
passages
there
are
tragedies
and
comedies
there
are
griefs
that
go
to
one's
heart
there
are
sayings
and
doings
that
make
you
laugh
indeed
the
whole
thing
is
exactly
like
real
life
o
m
your
dreaming
mind
originates
the
scheme
consistently
and
artistically
develops
it
and
carries
the
little
drama
creditably
through
all
without
help
or
suggestion
from
you
y
m
yes
o
m
it
is
argument
that
it
could
do
the
like
awake
without
help
or
suggestion
from
you
and
i
think
it
does
it
is
argument
that
it
is
the
same
old
mind
in
both
cases
and
never
needs
your
help
i
think
the
mind
is
purely
a
machine
a
thoroughly
independent
machine
an
automatic
machine
have
you
tried
the
other
experiment
which
i
suggested
to
you
y
m
which
one
o
m
the
one
which
was
to
determine
how
much
influence
you
have
over
your
mind
if
any
y
m
yes
and
got
more
or
less
entertainment
out
of
it
i
did
as
you
ordered
i
placed
two
texts
before
my
eyes
one
a
dull
one
and
barren
of
interest
the
other
one
full
of
interest
inflamed
with
it
white
hot
with
it
i
commanded
my
mind
to
busy
itself
solely
with
the
dull
one
o
m
did
it
obey
y
m
well
no
it
didn't
it
busied
itself
with
the
other
one
o
m
did
you
try
hard
to
make
it
obey
y
m
yes
i
did
my
honest
best
o
m
what
was
the
text
which
it
refused
to
be
interested
in
or
think
about
y
m
it
was
this
question
if
a
owes
b
a
dollar
and
a
half
and
b
owes
c
two
and
three
quarter
and
c
owes
a
thirty
five
cents
and
d
and
a
together
owe
e
and
b
three
sixteenths
of
of
i
don't
remember
the
rest
now
but
anyway
it
was
wholly
uninteresting
and
i
could
not
force
my
mind
to
stick
to
it
even
half
a
minute
at
a
time
it
kept
flying
off
to
the
other
text
o
m
what
was
the
other
text
y
m
it
is
no
matter
about
that
o
m
but
what
was
it
y
m
a
photograph
o
m
your
own
y
m
no
it
was
hers
o
m
you
really
made
an
honest
good
test
did
you
make
a
second
trial
y
m
yes
i
commanded
my
mind
to
interest
itself
in
the
morning
paper's
report
of
the
pork
market
and
at
the
same
time
i
reminded
it
of
an
experience
of
mine
of
sixteen
years
ago
it
refused
to
consider
the
pork
and
gave
its
whole
blazing
interest
to
that
ancient
incident
o
m
what
was
the
incident
y
m
an
armed
desperado
slapped
my
face
in
the
presence
of
twenty
spectators
it
makes
me
wild
and
murderous
every
time
i
think
of
it
o
m
good
tests
both
very
good
tests
did
you
try
my
other
suggestion
y
m
the
one
which
was
to
prove
to
me
that
if
i
would
leave
my
mind
to
its
own
devices
it
would
find
things
to
think
about
without
any
of
my
help
and
thus
convince
me
that
it
was
a
machine
an
automatic
machine
set
in
motion
by
exterior
influences
and
as
independent
of
me
as
it
could
be
if
it
were
in
some
one
else's
skull
is
that
the
one
o
m
yes
y
m
i
tried
it
i
was
shaving
i
had
slept
well
and
my
mind
was
very
lively
even
gay
and
frisky
it
was
reveling
in
a
fantastic
and
joyful
episode
of
my
remote
boyhood
which
had
suddenly
flashed
up
in
my
memory
moved
to
this
by
the
spectacle
of
a
yellow
cat
picking
its
way
carefully
along
the
top
of
the
garden
wall
the
color
of
this
cat
brought
the
bygone
cat
before
me
and
i
saw
her
walking
along
the
side
step
of
the
pulpit
saw
her
walk
on
to
a
large
sheet
of
sticky
fly
paper
and
get
all
her
feet
involved
saw
her
struggle
and
fall
down
helpless
and
dissatisfied
more
and
more
urgent
more
and
more
unreconciled
more
and
more
mutely
profane
saw
the
silent
congregation
quivering
like
jelly
and
the
tears
running
down
their
faces
i
saw
it
all
the
sight
of
the
tears
whisked
my
mind
to
a
far
distant
and
a
sadder
scene
in
terra
del
fuego
and
with
darwin's
eyes
i
saw
a
naked
great
savage
hurl
his
little
boy
against
the
rocks
for
a
trifling
fault
saw
the
poor
mother
gather
up
her
dying
child
and
hug
it
to
her
breast
and
weep
uttering
no
word
did
my
mind
stop
to
mourn
with
that
nude
black
sister
of
mine
no
it
was
far
away
from
that
scene
in
an
instant
and
was
busying
itself
with
an
ever
recurring
and
disagreeable
dream
of
mine
in
this
dream
i
always
find
myself
stripped
to
my
shirt
cringing
and
dodging
about
in
the
midst
of
a
great
drawing
room
throng
of
finely
dressed
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
wondering
how
i
got
there
and
so
on
and
so
on
picture
after
picture
incident
after
incident
a
drifting
panorama
of
ever
changing
ever
dissolving
views
manufactured
by
my
mind
without
any
help
from
me
why
it
would
take
me
two
hours
to
merely
name
the
multitude
of
things
my
mind
tallied
off
and
photographed
in
fifteen
minutes
let
alone
describe
them
to
you
o
m
a
man's
mind
left
free
has
no
use
for
his
help
but
there
is
one
way
whereby
he
can
get
its
help
when
he
desires
it
y
m
what
is
that
way
o
m
when
your
mind
is
racing
along
from
subject
to
subject
and
strikes
an
inspiring
one
open
your
mouth
and
begin
talking
upon
that
matter
or
take
your
pen
and
use
that
it
will
interest
your
mind
and
concentrate
it
and
it
will
pursue
the
subject
with
satisfaction
it
will
take
full
charge
and
furnish
the
words
itself
y
m
but
don't
i
tell
it
what
to
say
o
m
there
are
certainly
occasions
when
you
haven't
time
the
words
leap
out
before
you
know
what
is
coming
y
m
for
instance
o
m
well
take
a
flash
of
wit
repartee
flash
is
the
right
word
it
is
out
instantly
there
is
no
time
to
arrange
the
words
there
is
no
thinking
no
reflecting
where
there
is
a
wit
mechanism
it
is
automatic
in
its
action
and
needs
no
help
where
the
wit
mechanism
is
lacking
no
amount
of
study
and
reflection
can
manufacture
the
product
y
m
you
really
think
a
man
originates
nothing
creates
nothing
the
thinking
process
o
m
i
do
men
perceive
and
their
brain
machines
automatically
combine
the
things
perceived
that
is
all
y
m
the
steam
engine
o
m
it
takes
fifty
men
a
hundred
years
to
invent
it
one
meaning
of
invent
is
discover
i
use
the
word
in
that
sense
little
by
little
they
discover
and
apply
the
multitude
of
details
that
go
to
make
the
perfect
engine
watt
noticed
that
confined
steam
was
strong
enough
to
lift
the
lid
of
the
teapot
he
didn't
create
the
idea
he
merely
discovered
the
fact
the
cat
had
noticed
it
a
hundred
times
from
the
teapot
he
evolved
the
cylinder
from
the
displaced
lid
he
evolved
the
piston
rod
to
attach
something
to
the
piston
rod
to
be
moved
by
it
was
a
simple
matter
crank
and
wheel
and
so
there
was
a
working
engine
one
by
one
improvements
were
discovered
by
men
who
used
their
eyes
not
their
creating
powers
for
they
hadn't
any
and
now
after
a
hundred
years
the
patient
contributions
of
fifty
or
a
hundred
observers
stand
compacted
in
the
wonderful
machine
which
drives
the
ocean
liner
y
m
a
shakespearean
play
o
m
the
process
is
the
same
the
first
actor
was
a
savage
he
reproduced
in
his
theatrical
war
dances
scalp
dances
and
so
on
incidents
which
he
had
seen
in
real
life
a
more
advanced
civilization
produced
more
incidents
more
episodes
the
actor
and
the
story
teller
borrowed
them
and
so
the
drama
grew
little
by
little
stage
by
stage
it
is
made
up
of
the
facts
of
life
not
creations
it
took
centuries
to
develop
the
greek
drama
it
borrowed
from
preceding
ages
it
lent
to
the
ages
that
came
after
men
observe
and
combine
that
is
all
so
does
a
rat
y
m
how
o
m
he
observes
a
smell
he
infers
a
cheese
he
seeks
and
finds
the
astronomer
observes
this
and
that
adds
his
this
and
that
to
the
this
and
thats
of
a
hundred
predecessors
infers
an
invisible
planet
seeks
it
and
finds
it
the
rat
gets
into
a
trap
gets
out
with
trouble
infers
that
cheese
in
traps
lacks
value
and
meddles
with
that
trap
no
more
the
astronomer
is
very
proud
of
his
achievement
the
rat
is
proud
of
his
yet
both
are
machines
they
have
done
machine
work
they
have
originated
nothing
they
have
no
right
to
be
vain
the
whole
credit
belongs
to
their
maker
they
are
entitled
to
no
honors
no
praises
no
monuments
when
they
die
no
remembrance
one
is
a
complex
and
elaborate
machine
the
other
a
simple
and
limited
machine
but
they
are
alike
in
principle
function
and
process
and
neither
of
them
works
otherwise
than
automatically
and
neither
of
them
may
righteously
claim
a
personal
superiority
or
a
personal
dignity
above
the
other
y
m
in
earned
personal
dignity
then
and
in
personal
merit
for
what
he
does
it
follows
of
necessity
that
he
is
on
the
same
level
as
a
rat
o
m
his
brother
the
rat
yes
that
is
how
it
seems
to
me
neither
of
them
being
entitled
to
any
personal
merit
for
what
he
does
it
follows
of
necessity
that
neither
of
them
has
a
right
to
arrogate
to
himself
personally
created
superiorities
over
his
brother
y
m
are
you
determined
to
go
on
believing
in
these
insanities
would
you
go
on
believing
in
them
in
the
face
of
able
arguments
backed
by
collated
facts
and
instances
o
m
i
have
been
a
humble
earnest
and
sincere
truth
seeker
y
m
very
well
o
m
the
humble
earnest
and
sincere
truth
seeker
is
always
convertible
by
such
means
y
m
i
am
thankful
to
god
to
hear
you
say
this
for
now
i
know
that
your
conversion
o
m
wait
you
misunderstand
i
said
i
have
been
a
truth
seeker
y
m
well
o
m
i
am
not
that
now
have
your
forgotten
i
told
you
that
there
are
none
but
temporary
truth
seekers
that
a
permanent
one
is
a
human
impossibility
that
as
soon
as
the
seeker
finds
what
he
is
thoroughly
convinced
is
the
truth
he
seeks
no
further
but
gives
the
rest

hunting
junk

patch
it
and
caulk
it
and
prop
it
with
and
make
it
weather
proof
and
keep
it
from
caving

hence
the
presbyterian
remains
a

a
mohammedan
the

a

a

a

the

a

if
a
humble
earnest
and
sincere
seeker
after
truth
should
find
it
in
the
proposition
that
the
moon
is
made
of
green
cheese
nothing
could
ever
budge
him
from
that
position
for
he
is
nothing
but
an
automatic
machine
and
must
obey
the
laws
of
his
construction
y
m
and
so
o
m
having
found
the
truth
perceiving
that
beyond
question
man
has
but
one
moving
impulse
the
contenting
of
his
own
spirit
and
is
merely
a
machine
and
entitled
to
no
personal
merit
for
anything
he
does
it
is
not
humanly
possible
for
me
to
seek
further
the
rest
of
my
days
will
be
spent
in
patching
and
painting
and
puttying
and
caulking
my
priceless
possession
and
in
looking
the
other
way
when
an
imploring
argument
or
a
damaging
fact
approaches
the
marquess
of
worcester
had
done
all
of
this
more
than
a
century
earlier
vi
instinct
and
thought
young
man
it
is
odious
those
drunken
theories
of
yours
advanced
a
while
ago
concerning
the
rat
and
all
that
strip
man
bare
of
all
his
dignities
grandeurs
sublimities
old
man
he
hasn't
any
to
strip
they
are
shams
stolen
clothes
he
claims
credits
which
belong
solely
to
his
maker
y
m
but
you
have
no
right
to
put
him
on
a
level
with
a
rat
o
m
i
don't
morally
that
would
not
be
fair
to
the
rat
the
rat
is
well
above
him
there
y
m
are
you
joking
o
m
no
i
am
not
y
m
then
what
do
you
mean
o
m
that
comes
under
the
head
of
the
moral
sense
it
is
a
large
question
let
us
finish
with
what
we
are
about
now
before
we
take
it
up
y
m
very
well
you
have
seemed
to
concede
that
you
place
man
and
the
rat
on
a
level
what
is
it
the
intellectual
o
m
in
form
not
a
degree
y
m
explain
o
m
i
think
that
the
rat's
mind
and
the
man's
mind
are
the
same
machine
but
of
unequal
capacities
like
yours
and
edison's
like
the
african
pygmy's
and
homer's
like
the
bushman's
and
bismarck's
y
m
how
are
you
going
to
make
that
out
when
the
lower
animals
have
no
mental
quality
but
instinct
while
man
possesses
reason
o
m
what
is
instinct
y
m
it
is
merely
unthinking
and
mechanical
exercise
of
inherited
habit
o
m
what
originated
the
habit
y
m
the
first
animal
started
it
its
descendants
have
inherited
it
o
m
how
did
the
first
one
come
to
start
it
y
m
i
don't
know
but
it
didn't
think
it
out
o
m
how
do
you
know
it
didn't
y
m
well
i
have
a
right
to
suppose
it
didn't
anyway
o
m
i
don't
believe
you
have
what
is
thought
y
m
i
know
what
you
call
it
the
mechanical
and
automatic
putting
together
of
impressions
received
from
outside
and
drawing
an
inference
from
them
o
m
very
good
now
my
idea
of
the
meaningless
term
instinct
is
that
it
is
merely
petrified
thought
solidified
and
made
inanimate
by
habit
thought
which
was
once
alive
and
awake
but
is
become
unconscious
walks
in
its
sleep
so
to
speak
y
m
illustrate
it
o
m
take
a
herd
of
cows
feeding
in
a
pasture
their
heads
are
all
turned
in
one
direction
they
do
that
instinctively
they
gain
nothing
by
it
they
have
no
reason
for
it
they
don't
know
why
they
do
it
it
is
an
inherited
habit
which
was
originally
thought
that
is
to
say
observation
of
an
exterior
fact
and
a
valuable
inference
drawn
from
that
observation
and
confirmed
by
experience
the
original
wild
ox
noticed
that
with
the
wind
in
his
favor
he
could
smell
his
enemy
in
time
to
escape
then
he
inferred
that
it
was
worth
while
to
keep
his
nose
to
the
wind
that
is
the
process
which
man
calls
reasoning
man's
thought
machine
works
just
like
the
other
animals
but
it
is
a
better
one
and
more
edisonian
man
in
the
ox's
place
would
go
further
reason
wider
he
would
face
part
of
the
herd
the
other
way
and
protect
both
front
and
rear
y
m
did
you
stay
the
term
instinct
is
meaningless
o
m
i
think
it
is
a
bastard
word
i
think
it
confuses
us
for
as
a
rule
it
applies
itself
to
habits
and
impulses
which
had
a
far
off
origin
in
thought
and
now
and
then
breaks
the
rule
and
applies
itself
to
habits
which
can
hardly
claim
a
thought
origin
y
m
give
an
instance
o
m
well
in
putting
on
trousers
a
man
always
inserts
the
same
old
leg
first
never
the
other
one
there
is
no
advantage
in
that
and
no
sense
in
it
all
men
do
it
yet
no
man
thought
it
out
and
adopted
it
of
set
purpose
i
imagine
but
it
is
a
habit
which
is
transmitted
no
doubt
and
will
continue
to
be
transmitted
y
m
can
you
prove
that
the
habit
exists
o
m
you
can
prove
it
if
you
doubt
if
you
will
take
a
man
to
a
clothing
store
and
watch
him
try
on
a
dozen
pairs
of
trousers
you
will
see
y
m
the
cow
illustration
is
not
o
m
sufficient
to
show
that
a
dumb
animal's
mental
machine
is
just
the
same
as
a
man's
and
its
reasoning
processes
the
same
i
will
illustrate
further
if
you
should
hand
mr
edison
a
box
which
you
caused
to
fly
open
by
some
concealed
device
he
would
infer
a
spring
and
would
hunt
for
it
and
find
it
now
an
uncle
of
mine
had
an
old
horse
who
used
to
get
into
the
closed
lot
where
the
corn
crib
was
and
dishonestly
take
the
corn
i
got
the
punishment
myself
as
it
was
supposed
that
i
had
heedlessly
failed
to
insert
the
wooden
pin
which
kept
the
gate
closed
these
persistent
punishments
fatigued
me
they
also
caused
me
to
infer
the
existence
of
a
culprit
somewhere
so
i
hid
myself
and
watched
the
gate
presently
the
horse
came
and
pulled
the
pin
out
with
his
teeth
and
went
in
nobody
taught
him
that
he
had
observed
then
thought
it
out
for
himself
his
process
did
not
differ
from
edison's
he
put
this
and
that
together
and
drew
an
inference
and
the
peg
too
but
i
made
him
sweat
for
it
y
m
it
has
something
of
the
seeming
of
thought
about
it
still
it
is
not
very
elaborate
enlarge
o
m
suppose
mr
edison
has
been
enjoying
some
one's
hospitalities
he
comes
again
by
and
by
and
the
house
is
vacant
he
infers
that
his
host
has
moved
a
while
afterward
in
another
town
he
sees
the
man
enter
a
house
he
infers
that
that
is
the
new
home
and
follows
to
inquire
here
now
is
the
experience
of
a
gull
as
related
by
a
naturalist
the
scene
is
a
scotch
fishing
village
where
the
gulls
were
kindly
treated
this
particular
gull
visited
a
cottage
was
fed
came
next
day
and
was
fed
again
came
into
the
house
next
time
and
ate
with
the
family
kept
on
doing
this
almost
daily
thereafter
but
once
the
gull
was
away
on
a
journey
for
a
few
days
and
when
it
returned
the
house
was
vacant
its
friends
had
removed
to
a
village
three
miles
distant
several
months
later
it
saw
the
head
of
the
family
on
the
street
there
followed
him
home
entered
the
house
without
excuse
or
apology
and
became
a
daily
guest
again
gulls
do
not
rank
high
mentally
but
this
one
had
memory
and
the
reasoning
faculty
you
see
and
applied
them
edisonially
y
m
yet
it
was
not
an
edison
and
couldn't
be
developed
into
one
o
m
perhaps
not
could
you
y
m
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
go
on
o
m
if
edison
were
in
trouble
and
a
stranger
helped
him
out
of
it
and
next
day
he
got
into
the
same
difficulty
again
he
would
infer
the
wise
thing
to
do
in
case
he
knew
the
stranger's
address
here
is
a
case
of
a
bird
and
a
stranger
as
related
by
a
naturalist
an
englishman
saw
a
bird
flying
around
about
his
dog's
head
down
in
the
grounds
and
uttering
cries
of
distress
he
went
there
to
see
about
it
the
dog
had
a
young
bird
in
his
mouth
unhurt
the
gentleman
rescued
it
and
put
it
on
a
bush
and
brought
the
dog
away
early
the
next
morning
the
mother
bird
came
for
the
gentleman
who
was
sitting
on
his
veranda
and
by
its
maneuvers
persuaded
him
to
follow
it
to
a
distant
part
of
the
grounds
flying
a
little
way
in
front
of
him
and
waiting
for
him
to
catch
up
and
so
on
and
keeping
to
the
winding
path
too
instead
of
flying
the
near
way
across
lots
the
distance
covered
was
four
hundred
yards
the
same
dog
was
the
culprit
he
had
the
young
bird
again
and
once
more
he
had
to
give
it
up
now
the
mother
bird
had
reasoned
it
all
out
since
the
stranger
had
helped
her
once
she
inferred
that
he
would
do
it
again
she
knew
where
to
find
him
and
she
went
upon
her
errand
with
confidence
her
mental
processes
were
what
edison's
would
have
been
she
put
this
and
that
together
and
that
is
all
that
thought
is
and
out
of
them
built
her
logical
arrangement
of
inferences
edison
couldn't
have
done
it
any
better
himself
y
m
do
you
believe
that
many
of
the
dumb
animals
can
think
o
m
yes
the
elephant
the
monkey
the
horse
the
dog
the
parrot
the
macaw
the
mocking
bird
and
many
others
the
elephant
whose
mate
fell
into
a
pit
and
who
dumped
dirt
and
rubbish
into
the
pit
till
bottom
was
raised
high
enough
to
enable
the
captive
to
step
out
was
equipped
with
the
reasoning
quality
i
conceive
that
all
animals
that
can
learn
things
through
teaching
and
drilling
have
to
know
how
to
observe
and
put
this
and
that
together
and
draw
an
inference
the
process
of
thinking
could
you
teach
an
idiot
the
manual
of
arms
and
to
advance
retreat
and
go
through
complex
field
maneuvers
at
the
word
of
command
y
m
not
if
he
were
a
thorough
idiot
o
m
well
canary
birds
can
learn
all
that
dogs
and
elephants
learn
all
sorts
of
wonderful
things
they
must
surely
be
able
to
notice
and
to
put
things
together
and
say
to
themselves
i
get
the
idea
now
when
i
do
so
and
so
as
per
order
i
am
praised
and
fed
when
i
do
differently
i
am
punished
fleas
can
be
taught
nearly
anything
that
a
congressman
can
y
m
granting
then
that
dumb
animals
are
able
to
think
upon
a
low
plane
is
there
any
that
can
think
upon
a
high
one
is
there
one
that
is
well
up
toward
man
o
m
yes
as
a
thinker
and
planner
the
ant
is
the
equal
of
any
savage
race
of
men
as
a
self
educated
specialist
in
several
arts
she
is
the
superior
of
any
savage
race
of
men
and
in
one
or
two
high
mental
qualities
she
is
above
the
reach
of
any
man
savage
or
civilized
y
m
oh
come
you
are
abolishing
the
intellectual
frontier
which
separates
man
and
beast
o
m
i
beg
your
pardon
one
cannot
abolish
what
does
not
exist
y
m
you
are
not
in
earnest
i
hope
you
cannot
mean
to
seriously
say
there
is
no
such
frontier
o
m
i
do
say
it
seriously
the
instances
of
the
horse
the
gull
the
mother
bird
and
the
elephant
show
that
those
creatures
put
their
this's
and
thats
together
just
as
edison
would
have
done
it
and
drew
the
same
inferences
that
he
would
have
drawn
their
mental
machinery
was
just
like
his
also
its
manner
of
working
their
equipment
was
as
inferior
to
the
strasburg
clock
but
that
is
the
only
difference
there
is
no
frontier
y
m
it
looks
exasperatingly
true
and
is
distinctly
offensive
it
elevates
the
dumb
beasts
to
to
o
m
let
us
drop
that
lying
phrase
and
call
them
the
unrevealed
creatures
so
far
as
we
can
know
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
dumb
beast
y
m
on
what
grounds
do
you
make
that
assertion
o
m
on
quite
simple
ones
dumb
beast
suggests
an
animal
that
has
no
thought
machinery
no
understanding
no
speech
no
way
of
communicating
what
is
in
its
mind
we
know
that
a
hen
has
speech
we
cannot
understand
everything
she
says
but
we
easily
learn
two
or
three
of
her
phrases
we
know
when
she
is
saying
i
have
laid
an
egg
we
know
when
she
is
saying
to
the
chicks
run
here
dears
i've
found
a
worm
we
know
what
she
is
saying
when
she
voices
a
warning
quick
hurry
gather
yourselves
under
mamma
there's
a
hawk
coming
we
understand
the
cat
when
she
stretches
herself
out
purring
with
affection
and
contentment
and
lifts
up
a
soft
voice
and
says
come
kitties
supper's
ready
we
understand
her
when
she
goes
mourning
about
and
says
where
can
they
be
they
are
lost
won't
you
help
me
hunt
for
them
and
we
understand
the
disreputable
tom
when
he
challenges
at
midnight
from
his
shed
you
come
over
here
you
product
of
immoral
commerce
and
i'll
make
your
fur
fly
we
understand
a
few
of
a
dog's
phrases
and
we
learn
to
understand
a
few
of
the
remarks
and
gestures
of
any
bird
or
other
animal
that
we
domesticate
and
observe
the
clearness
and
exactness
of
the
few
of
the
hen's
speeches
which
we
understand
is
argument
that
she
can
communicate
to
her
kind
a
hundred
things
which
we
cannot
comprehend
in
a
word
that
she
can
converse
and
this
argument
is
also
applicable
in
the
case
of
others
of
the
great
army
of
the
unrevealed
it
is
just
like
man's
vanity
and
impertinence
to
call
an
animal
dumb
because
it
is
dumb
to
his
dull
perceptions
now
as
to
the
ant
y
m
yes
go
back
to
the
ant
the
creature
that
as
you
seem
to
think
sweeps
away
the
last
vestige
of
an
intellectual
frontier
between
man
and
the
unrevealed
o
m
that
is
what
she
surely
does
in
all
his
history
the
aboriginal
australian
never
thought
out
a
house
for
himself
and
built
it
the
ant
is
an
amazing
architect
she
is
a
wee
little
creature
but
she
builds
a
strong
and
enduring
house
eight
feet
high
a
house
which
is
as
large
in
proportion
to
her
size
as
is
the
largest
capitol
or
cathedral
in
the
world
compared
to
man's
size
no
savage
race
has
produced
architects
who
could
approach
the
ant
in
genius
or
culture
no
civilized
race
has
produced
architects
who
could
plan
a
house
better
for
the
uses
proposed
than
can
hers
her
house
contains
a
throne
room
nurseries
for
her
young
granaries
apartments
for
her
soldiers
her
workers
etc
and
they
and
the
multifarious
halls
and
corridors
which
communicate
with
them
are
arranged
and
distributed
with
an
educated
and
experienced
eye
for
convenience
and
adaptability
y
m
that
could
be
mere
instinct
o
m
it
would
elevate
the
savage
if
he
had
it
but
let
us
look
further
before
we
decide
the
ant
has
soldiers
battalions
regiments
armies
and
they
have
their
appointed
captains
and
generals
who
lead
them
to
battle
y
m
that
could
be
instinct
too
o
m
we
will
look
still
further
the
ant
has
a
system
of
government
it
is
well
planned
elaborate
and
is
well
carried
on
y
m
instinct
again
o
m
she

y

the
ant
discriminates
between
friend
and
stranger
sir
john
lubbock
took
ants
from
two
different
nests
made
them
drunk
with
whiskey
and
laid
them
unconscious
by
one
of
the
nests
near
some
water
ants
from
the
nest
came
and
examined
and
discussed
these
disgraced
creatures
then
carried
their
friends
home
and
threw
the
strangers
overboard
sir
john
repeated
the
experiment
a
number
of
times
for
a
time
the
sober
ants
did
as
they
had
done
at
first
carried
their
friends
home
and
threw
the
strangers
overboard
but
finally
they
lost
patience
seeing
that
their
reformatory
efforts
went
for
nothing
and
threw
both
friends
and
strangers
overboard
come
is
this
instinct
or
is
it
thoughtful
and
intelligent
discussion
of
a
thing
new
absolutely
new
to
their
experience
with
a
verdict
arrived
at
sentence
passed
and
judgment
executed
is
it
instinct
thought
petrified
by
ages
of
habit
or
isn't
it
brand
new
thought
inspired
by
the
new
occasion
the
new
circumstances
y
m
i
have
to
concede
it
it
was
not
a
result
of
habit
it
has
all
the
look
of
reflection
thought
putting
this
and
that
together
as
you
phrase
it
i
believe
it
was
thought
o
m
i
will
give
you
another
instance
of
thought
franklin
had
a
cup
of
sugar
on
a
table
in
his
room
the
ants
got
at
it
he
tried
several
preventives
and
ants
rose
superior
to
them
finally
he
contrived
one
which
shut
off
access
probably
set
the
table's
legs
in
pans
of
water
or
drew
a
circle
of
tar
around
the
cup
i
don't
remember
at
any
rate
he
watched
to
see
what
they
would
do
they
tried
various
schemes
failures
every
one
the
ants
were
badly
puzzled
finally
they
held
a
consultation
discussed
the
problem
arrived
at
a
decision
and
this
time
they
beat
that
great
philosopher
they
formed
in
procession
cross
the
floor
climbed
the
wall
marched
across
the
ceiling
to
a
point
just
over
the
cup
then
one
by
one
they
let
go
and
fell
down
into
it
was
that
instinct
thought
petrified
by
ages
of
inherited
habit
y
m
no
i
don't
believe
it
was
i
believe
it
was
a
newly
reasoned
scheme
to
meet
a
new
emergency
o
m
very
well
you
have
conceded
the
reasoning
power
in
two
instances
i
come
now
to
a
mental
detail
wherein
the
ant
is
a
long
way
the
superior
of
any
human
being
sir
john
lubbock
proved
by
many
experiments
that
an
ant
knows
a
stranger
ant
of
her
own
species
in
a
moment
even
when
the
stranger
is
disguised
with
paint
also
he
proved
that
an
ant
knows
every
individual
in
her
hive
of
five
hundred
thousand
souls
also
after
a
year's
absence
one
of
the
five
hundred
thousand
she
will
straightway
recognize
the
returned
absentee
and
grace
the
recognition
with
an
affectionate
welcome
how
are
these
recognitions
made
not
by
color
for
painted
ants
were
recognized
not
by
smell
for
ants
that
had
been
dipped
in
chloroform
were
recognized
not
by
speech
and
not
by
antennae
signs
nor
contacts
for
the
drunken
and
motionless
ants
were
recognized
and
the
friend
discriminated
from
the
stranger
the
ants
were
all
of
the
same
species
therefore
the
friends
had
to
be
recognized
by
form
and
feature
friends
who
formed
part
of
a
hive
of
five
hundred
thousand
has
any
man
a
memory
for
form
and
feature
approaching
that
y
m
certainly
not
o
m
franklin's
ants
and
lubbuck's
ants
show
fine
capacities
of
putting
this
and
that
together
in
new
and
untried
emergencies
and
deducting
smart
conclusions
from
the
combinations
a
man's
mental
process
exactly
with
memory
to
help
man
preserves
his
observations
and
reasonings
reflects
upon
them
adds
to
them
recombines
and
so
proceeds
stage
by
stage
to
far
results
from
the
teakettle
to
the
ocean
greyhound's
complex
engine
from
personal
labor
to
slave
labor
from
wigwam
to
palace
from
the
capricious
chase
to
agriculture
and
stored
food
from
nomadic
life
to
stable
government
and
concentrated
authority
from
incoherent
hordes
to
massed
armies
the
ant
has
observation
the
reasoning
faculty
and
the
preserving
adjunct
of
a
prodigious
memory
she
has
duplicated
man's
development
and
the
essential
features
of
his
civilization
and
you
call
it
all
instinct
y
m
perhaps
i
lacked
the
reasoning
faculty
myself
o
m
well
don't
tell
anybody
and
don't
do
it
again
y
m
we
have
come
a
good
way
as
a
result
as
i
understand
it
i
am
required
to
concede
that
there
is
absolutely
no
intellectual
frontier
separating
man
and
the
unrevealed
creatures
o
m
that
is
what
you
are
required
to
concede
there
is
no
such
frontier
there
is
no
way
to
get
around
that
man
has
a
finer
and
more
capable
machine
in
him
than
those
others
but
it
is
the
same
machine
and
works
in
the
same
way
and
neither
he
nor
those
others
can
command
the
machine
it
is
strictly
automatic
independent
of
control
works
when
it
pleases
and
when
it
doesn't
please
it
can't
be
forced
y
m
then
man
and
the
other
animals
are
all
alike
as
to
mental
machinery
and
there
isn't
any
difference
of
any
stupendous
magnitude
between
them
except
in
quality
not
in
kind
o
m
that
is
about
the
state
of
it
intellectuality
there
are
pronounced
limitations
on
both
sides
we
can't
learn
to
understand
much
of
their
language
but
the
dog
the
elephant
etc
learn
to
understand
a
very
great
deal
of
ours
to
that
extent
they
are
our
superiors
on
the
other
hand
they
can't
learn
reading
writing
etc
nor
any
of
our
fine
and
high
things
and
there
we
have
a
large
advantage
over
them
y
m
very
well
let
them
have
what
they've
got
and
welcome
there
is
still
a
wall
and
a
lofty
one
they
haven't
got
the
moral
sense
we
have
it
and
it
lifts
us
immeasurably
above
them
o
m
what
makes
you
think
that
y
m
now
look
here
let's
call
a
halt
i
have
stood
the
other
infamies
and
insanities
and
that
is
enough
i
am
not
going
to
have
man
and
the
other
animals
put
on
the
same
level
morally
o
m
i
wasn't
going
to
hoist
man
up
to
that
y
m
this
is
too
much
i
think
it
is
not
right
to
jest
about
such
things
o
m
i
am
not
jesting
i
am
merely
reflecting
a
plain
and
simple
truth
and
without
uncharitableness
the
fact
that
man
knows
right
from
wrong
proves
his
intellectual
superiority
to
the
other
creatures
but
the
fact
that
he
can
do
wrong
proves
his
moral
inferiority
to
any
creature
that
cannot
it
is
my
belief
that
this
position
is
not
assailable
free
will
y
m
what
is
your
opinion
regarding
free
will
o
m
that
there
is
no
such
thing
did
the
man
possess
it
who
gave
the
old
woman
his
last
shilling
and
trudged
home
in
the
storm
y
m
he
had
the
choice
between
succoring
the
old
woman
and
leaving
her
to
suffer
isn't
it
so
o
m
yes
there
was
a
choice
to
be
made
between
bodily
comfort
on
the
one
hand
and
the
comfort
of
the
spirit
on
the
other
the
body
made
a
strong
appeal
of
course
the
body
would
be
quite
sure
to
do
that
the
spirit
made
a
counter
appeal
a
choice
had
to
be
made
between
the
two
appeals
and
was
made
who
or
what
determined
that
choice
y
m
any
one
but
you
would
say
that
the
man
determined
it
and
that
in
doing
it
he
exercised
free
will
o
m
we
are
constantly
assured
that
every
man
is
endowed
with
free
will
and
that
he
can
and
must
exercise
it
where
he
is
offered
a
choice
between
good
conduct
and
less
good
conduct
yet
we
clearly
saw
that
in
that
man's
case
he
really
had
no
free
will
his
temperament
his
training
and
the
daily
influences
which
had
molded
him
and
made
him
what
he
was
compelled
him
to
rescue
the
old
woman
and
thus
save
himself
save
himself
from
spiritual
pain
from
unendurable
wretchedness
he
did
not
make
the
choice
it
was
made
for
him
by
forces
which
he
could
not
control
free
will
has
always
existed
in
words
but
it
stops
there
i
think
stops
short
of
fact
i
would
not
use
those
words
free
will
but
others
y
m
what
others
o
m
free
choice
y
m
what
is
the
difference
o
m
the
one
implies
untrammeled
power
to
act
as
you
please
the
other
implies
nothing
beyond
a
mere
mental
process
the
critical
ability
to
determine
which
of
two
things
is
nearest
right
and
just
y
m
make
the
difference
clear
please
o
m
the
mind
can
freely
select
choose
point
out
the
right
and
just
one
its
function
stops
there
it
can
go
no
further
in
the
matter
it
has
no
authority
to
say
that
the
right
one
shall
be
acted
upon
and
the
wrong
one
discarded
that
authority
is
in
other
hands
y
m
the
man's
o
m
in
the
machine
which
stands
for
him
in
his
born
disposition
and
the
character
which
has
been
built
around
it
by
training
and
environment
y
m
it
will
act
upon
the
right
one
of
the
two
o
m
it
will
do
as
it
pleases
in
the
matter
george
washington's
machine
would
act
upon
the
right
one
pizarro
would
act
upon
the
wrong
one
y
m
then
as
i
understand
it
a
bad
man's
mental
machinery
calmly
and
judicially
points
out
which
of
two
things
is
right
and
just
o
m
yes
and
his
moral
machinery
will
freely
act
upon
the
one
or
the
other
according
to
its
make
and
be
quite
indifferent
to
the
mind's
feeling
concerning
the
matter
that
is
would
be
if
the
mind
had
any
feelings
which
it
hasn't
it
is
merely
a
thermometer
it
registers
the
heat
and
the
cold
and
cares
not
a
farthing
about
either
y
m
then
we
must
not
claim
that
if
a
man
knows
which
of
two
things
is
right
he
is
absolutely
bound
to
do
that
thing
o
m
his
temperament
and
training
will
decide
what
he
shall
do
and
he
will
do
it
he
cannot
help
himself
he
has
no
authority
over
the
matter
wasn't
it
right
for
david
to
go
out
and
slay
goliath
y
m
yes
o
m
then
it
would
have
been
equally
right
for
any
one
else
to
do
it
y
m
certainly
o
m
then
it
would
have
been
right
for
a
born
coward
to
attempt
it
y
m
it
would
yes
o
m
you
know
that
no
born
coward
ever
would
have
attempted
it
don't
you
y
m
yes
o
m
you
know
that
a
born
coward's
make
and
temperament
would
be
an
absolute
and
insurmountable
bar
to
his
ever
essaying
such
a
thing
don't
you
y
m
yes
i
know
it
o
m
he
clearly
perceives
that
it
would
be
right
to
try
it
y
m
yes
o
m
his
mind
has
free
choice
in
determining
that
it
would
be
right
to
try
it
y
m
yes
o
m
then
if
by
reason
of
his
inborn
cowardice
he
simply
can
not
essay
it
what
becomes
of
his
free
will
where
is
his
free
will
why
claim
that
he
has
free
will
when
the
plain
facts
show
that
he
hasn't
why
contend
that
because
he
and
david
see
the
right
alike
both
must
act
alike
why
impose
the
same
laws
upon
goat
and
lion
y
m
there
is
really
no
such
thing
as
free
will
o
m
it
is
what
i
think
there
is
will
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
intellectual
perceptions
of
right
and
wrong
and
is
not
under
their
command
david's
temperament
and
training
had
will
and
it
was
a
compulsory
force
david
had
to
obey
its
decrees
he
had
no
choice
the
coward's
temperament
and
training
possess
will
and
it
is
compulsory
it
commands
him
to
avoid
danger
and
he
obeys
he
has
no
choice
but
neither
the
davids
nor
the
cowards
possess
free
will
will
that
may
do
the
right
or
do
the
wrong
as
their
mental
verdict
shall
decide
not
two
values
but
only
one
y
m
there
is
one
thing
which
bothers
me
i
can't
tell
where
you
draw
the
line
between
material
covetousness
and
spiritual
covetousness
o
m
i
don't
draw
any
y
m
how
do
you
mean
o
m
there
is
no
such
thing
as
material
covetousness
all
covetousness
is
spiritual
y
m
all
longings
desires
ambitions
spiritual
never
material
o
m
yes
the
master
in
you
requires
that
in
all
cases
you
shall
content
his
spirit
that
alone
he
never
requires
anything
else
he
never
interests
himself
in
any
other
matter
y
m
ah
come
when
he
covets
somebody's
money
isn't
that
rather
distinctly
material
and
gross
o
m
no
the
money
is
merely
a
symbol
it
represents
in
visible
and
concrete
form
a
spiritual
desire
any
so
called
material
thing
that
you
want
is
merely
a
symbol
you
want
it
not
for
itself
but
because
it
will
content
your
spirit
for
the
moment
y
m
please
particularize
o
m
very
well
maybe
the
thing
longed
for
is
a
new
hat
you
get
it
and
your
vanity
is
pleased
your
spirit
contented
suppose
your
friends
deride
the
hat
make
fun
of
it
at
once
it
loses
its
value
you
are
ashamed
of
it
you
put
it
out
of
your
sight
you
never
want
to
see
it
again
y
m
i
think
i
see
go
on
o
m
it
is
the
same
hat
isn't
it
it
is
in
no
way
altered
but
it
wasn't
the
hat
you
wanted
but
only
what
it
stood
for
a
something
to
please
and
content
your
spirit
when
it
failed
of
that
the
whole
of
its
value
was
gone
there
are
no
material
values
there
are
only
spiritual
ones
you
will
hunt
in
vain
for
a
material
value
that
is
actual
real
there
is
no
such
thing
the
only
value
it
possesses
for
even
a
moment
is
the
spiritual
value
back
of
it
remove
that
end
and
it
is
at
once
worthless
like
the
hat
y
m
can
you
extend
that
to
money
o
m
yes
it
is
merely
a
symbol
it
has
no
material
value
you
think
you
desire
it
for
its
own
sake
but
it
is
not
so
you
desire
it
for
the
spiritual
content
it
will
bring
if
it
fail
of
that
you
discover
that
its
value
is
gone
there
is
that
pathetic
tale
of
the
man
who
labored
like
a
slave
unresting
unsatisfied
until
he
had
accumulated
a
fortune
and
was
happy
over
it
jubilant
about
it
then
in
a
single
week
a
pestilence
swept
away
all
whom
he
held
dear
and
left
him
desolate
his
money's
value
was
gone
he
realized
that
his
joy
in
it
came
not
from
the
money
itself
but
from
the
spiritual
contentment
he
got
out
of
his
family's
enjoyment
of
the
pleasures
and
delights
it
lavished
upon
them
money
has
no
material
value
if
you
remove
its
spiritual
value
nothing
is
left
but
dross
it
is
so
with
all
things
little
or
big
majestic
or
trivial
there
are
no
exceptions
crowns
scepters
pennies
paste
jewels
village
notoriety
world
wide
fame
they
are
all
the
same
they
have
no
material
value
while
they
content
the
spirit
they
are
precious
when
this
fails
they
are
worthless
a
difficult
question
y
m
you
keep
me
confused
and
perplexed
all
the
time
by
your
elusive
terminology
sometimes
you
divide
a
man
up
into
two
or
three
separate
personalities
each
with
authorities
jurisdictions
and
responsibilities
of
its
own
and
when
he
is
in
that
condition
i
can't
grasp
it
now
when
i
speak
of
a
man
he
is
the
whole
thing
in
one
and
easy
to
hold
and
contemplate
o
m
that
is
pleasant
and
convenient
if
true
when
you
speak
of
my
body
who
is
the
my
y
m
it
is
the
me
o
m
the
body
is
a
property
then
and
the
me
owns
it
who
is
the
me
y
m
the
me
is
the
whole
thing
it
is
a
common
property
an
undivided
ownership
vested
in
the
whole
entity
o
m
if
the
me
admires
a
rainbow
is
it
the
whole
me
that
admires
it
including
the
hair
hands
heels
and
all
y
m
certainly
not
it
is
my
mind
that
admires
it
o
m
so
you
divide
the
me
yourself
everybody
does
everybody
must
what
then
definitely
is
the
me
y
m
i
think
it
must
consist
of
just
those
two
parts
the
body
and
the
mind
o
m
you
think
so
if
you
say
i
believe
the
world
is
round
who
is
the
i
that
is
speaking
y
m
the
mind
o
m
if
you
say
i
grieve
for
the
loss
of
my
father
who
is
the
i
y
m
the
mind
o
m
is
the
mind
exercising
an
intellectual
function
when
it
examines
and
accepts
the
evidence
that
the
world
is
round
y
m
yes
o
m
is
it
exercising
an
intellectual
function
when
it
grieves
for
the
loss
of
your
father
y
m
that
is
not
cerebration
brain
work
it
is
a
matter
of
feeling
o
m
then
its
source
is
not
in
your
mind
but
in
your
moral
territory
y
m
i
have
to
grant
it
o
m
is
your
mind
a
part
of
your
physical
equipment
y
m
no
it
is
independent
of
it
it
is
spiritual
o
m
being
spiritual
it
cannot
be
affected
by
physical
influences
y
m
no
o
m
does
the
mind
remain
sober
with
the
body
is
drunk
y
m
well
no
o
m
there
is
a
physical
effect
present
then
y
m
it
looks
like
it
o
m
a
cracked
skull
has
resulted
in
a
crazy
mind
why
should
it
happen
if
the
mind
is
spiritual
and
independent
of
physical
influences
y
m
well
i
don't
know
o
m
when
you
have
a
pain
in
your
foot
how
do
you
know
it
y
m
i
feel
it
o
m
but
you
do
not
feel
it
until
a
nerve
reports
the
hurt
to
the
brain
yet
the
brain
is
the
seat
of
the
mind
is
it
not
y
m
i
think
so
o
m
but
isn't
spiritual
enough
to
learn
what
is
happening
in
the
outskirts
without
the
help
of
the
physical
messenger
you
perceive
that
the
question
of
who
or
what
the
me
is
is
not
a
simple
one
at
all
you
say
i
admire
the
rainbow
and
i
believe
the
world
is
round
and
in
these
cases
we
find
that
the
me
is
not
speaking
but
only
the
mental
part
you
say
i
grieve
and
again
the
me
is
not
all
speaking
but
only
the
moral
part
you
say
the
mind
is
wholly
spiritual
then
you
say
i
have
a
pain
and
find
that
this
time
the
me
is
mental
and
spiritual
combined
we
all
use
the
i
in
this
indeterminate
fashion
there
is
no
help
for
it
we
imagine
a
master
and
king
over
what
you
call
the
whole
thing
and
we
speak
of
him
as
i
but
when
we
try
to
define
him
we
find
we
cannot
do
it
the
intellect
and
the
feelings
can
act
quite
independently
of
each
other
we
recognize
that
and
we
look
around
for
a
ruler
who
is
master
over
both
and
can
serve
as
a
definite
and
indisputable
i
and
enable
us
to
know
what
we
mean
and
who
or
what
we
are
talking
about
when
we
use
that
pronoun
but
we
have
to
give
it
up
and
confess
that
we
cannot
find
him
to
me
man
is
a
machine
made
up
of
many
mechanisms
the
moral
and
mental
ones
acting
automatically
in
accordance
with
the
impulses
of
an
interior
master
who
is
built
out
of
born
temperament
and
an
accumulation
of
multitudinous
outside
influences
and
trainings
a
machine
whose
one
function
is
to
secure
the
spiritual
contentment
of
the
master
be
his
desires
good
or
be
they
evil
a
machine
whose
will
is
absolute
and
must
be
obeyed
and
always
is
obeyed
y
m
maybe
the
me
is
the
soul
o
m
maybe
it
is
what
is
the
soul
y
m
i
don't
know
o
m
neither
does
any
one
else
the
master
passion
y
m
what
is
the
master
or
in
common
speech
the
conscience
explain
it
o
m
it
is
that
mysterious
autocrat
lodged
in
a
man
which
compels
the
man
to
content
its
desires
it
may
be
called
the
master
passion
the
hunger
for
self
approval
y
m
where
is
its
seat
o
m
in
man's
moral
constitution
y
m
are
its
commands
for
the
man's
good
o
m
it
is
indifferent
to
the
man's
good
it
never
concerns
itself
about
anything
but
the
satisfying
of
its
own
desires
it
can
be
trained
to
prefer
things
which
will
be
for
the
man's
good
but
it
will
prefer
them
only
because
they
will
content
it
better
than
other
things
would
y
m
then
even
when
it
is
trained
to
high
ideals
it
is
still
looking
out
for
its
own
contentment
and
not
for
the
man's
good
o
m
true
trained
or
untrained
it
cares
nothing
for
the
man's
good
and
never
concerns
itself
about
it
y
m
it
seems
to
be
an
immoral
force
seated
in
the
man's
moral
constitution
o
m
it
is
a
colorless
force
seated
in
the
man's
moral
constitution
let
us
call
it
an
instinct
a
blind
unreasoning
instinct
which
cannot
and
does
not
distinguish
between
good
morals
and
bad
ones
and
cares
nothing
for
results
to
the
man
provided
its
own
contentment
be
secured
and
it
will
always
secure
that
y
m
it
seeks
money
and
it
probably
considers
that
that
is
an
advantage
for
the
man
o
m
it
is
not
always
seeking
money
it
is
not
always
seeking
power
nor
office
nor
any
other
material
advantage
in
all
cases
it
seeks
a
spiritual
contentment
let
the
means
be
what
they
may
its
desires
are
determined
by
the
man's
temperament
and
it
is
lord
over
that
temperament
conscience
susceptibility
spiritual
appetite
are
in
fact
the
same
thing
have
you
ever
heard
of
a
person
who
cared
nothing
for
money
y
m
yes
a
scholar
who
would
not
leave
his
garret
and
his
books
to
take
a
place
in
a
business
house
at
a
large
salary
o
m
he
had
to
satisfy
his
master
that
is
to
say
his
temperament
his
spiritual
appetite
and
it
preferred
books
to
money
are
there
other
cases
y
m
yes
the
hermit
o
m
it
is
a
good
instance
the
hermit
endures
solitude
hunger
cold
and
manifold
perils
to
content
his
autocrat
who
prefers
these
things
and
prayer
and
contemplation
to
money
or
to
any
show
or
luxury
that
money
can
buy
are
there
others
y
m
yes
the
artist
the
poet
the
scientist
o
m
their
autocrat
prefers
the
deep
pleasures
of
these
occupations
either
well
paid
or
ill
paid
to
any
others
in
the
market
at
any
price
you
realize
that
the
master
passion
the
contentment
of
the
spirit
concerns
itself
with
many
things
besides
so
called
material
advantage
material
prosperity
cash
and
all
that
y
m
i
think
i
must
concede
it
o
m
i
believe
you
must
there
are
perhaps
as
many
temperaments
that
would
refuse
the
burdens
and
vexations
and
distinctions
of
public
office
as
there
are
that
hunger
after
them
the
one
set
of
temperaments
seek
the
contentment
of
the
spirit
and
that
alone
and
this
is
exactly
the
case
with
the
other
set
neither
set
seeks
anything
but
the
contentment
of
the
spirit
if
the
one
is
sordid
both
are
sordid
and
equally
so
since
the
end
in
view
is
precisely
the
same
in
both
cases
and
in
both
cases
temperament
decides
the
preference
and
temperament
is
born
not
made
conclusion
o
m
you
have
been
taking
a
holiday
y
m
yes
a
mountain
tramp
covering
a
week
are
you
ready
to
talk
o
m
quite
ready
what
shall
we
begin
with
y
m
well
lying
abed
resting
up
two
days
and
nights
i
have
thought
over
all
these
talks
and
passed
them
carefully
in
review
with
this
result
that
that
are
you
intending
to
publish
your
notions
about
man
some
day
o
m
now
and
then
in
these
past
twenty
years
the
master
inside
of
me
has
half
intended
to
order
me
to
set
them
to
paper
and
publish
them
do
i
have
to
tell
you
why
the
order
has
remained
unissued
or
can
you
explain
so
simple
a
thing
without
my
help
y
m
by
your
doctrine
it
is
simplicity
itself
outside
influences
moved
your
interior
master
to
give
the
order
stronger
outside
influences
deterred
him
without
the
outside
influences
neither
of
these
impulses
could
ever
have
been
born
since
a
person's
brain
is
incapable
or
originating
an
idea
within
itself
o
m
correct
go
on
y
m
the
matter
of
publishing
or
withholding
is
still
in
your
master's
hands
if
some
day
an
outside
influence
shall
determine
him
to
publish
he
will
give
the
order
and
it
will
be
obeyed
o
m
that
is
correct
well
y
m
upon
reflection
i
have
arrived
at
the
conviction
that
the
publication
of
your
doctrines
would
be
harmful
do
you
pardon
me
o
m
pardon
you
you
have
done
nothing
you
are
an
instrument
a
speaking
trumpet
speaking
trumpets
are
not
responsible
for
what
is
said
through
them
outside
influences
in
the
form
of
lifelong
teachings
trainings
notions
prejudices
and
other
second
hand
importations
have
persuaded
the
master
within
you
that
the
publication
of
these
doctrines
would
be
harmful
very
well
this
is
quite
natural
and
was
to
be
expected
in
fact
was
inevitable
go
on
for
the
sake
of
ease
and
convenience
stick
to
habit
speak
in
the
first
person
and
tell
me
what
your
master
thinks
about
it
y
m
well
to
begin
it
is
a
desolating
doctrine
it
is
not
inspiring
enthusing
uplifting
it
takes
the
glory
out
of
man
it
takes
the
pride
out
of
him
it
takes
the
heroism
out
of
him
it
denies
him
all
personal
credit
all
applause
it
not
only
degrades
him
to
a
machine
but
allows
him
no
control
over
the
machine
makes
a
mere
coffee
mill
of
him
and
neither
permits
him
to
supply
the
coffee
nor
turn
the
crank
his
sole
and
piteously
humble
function
being
to
grind
coarse
or
fine
according
to
his
make
outside
impulses
doing
the
rest
o
m
it
is
correctly
stated
tell
me
what
do
men
admire
most
in
each
other
y
m
intellect
courage
majesty
of
build
beauty
of
countenance
charity
benevolence
magnanimity
kindliness
heroism
and
and
o
m
i
would
not
go
any
further
these
are
elementals
virtue
fortitude
holiness
truthfulness
loyalty
high
ideals
these
and
all
the
related
qualities
that
are
named
in
the
dictionary
are
made
of
the
elementals
by
blendings
combinations
and
shadings
of
the
elementals
just
as
one
makes
green
by
blending
blue
and
yellow
and
makes
several
shades
and
tints
of
red
by
modifying
the
elemental
red
there
are
several
elemental
colors
they
are
all
in
the
rainbow
out
of
them
we
manufacture
and
name
fifty
shades
of
them
you
have
named
the
elementals
of
the
human
rainbow
and
also
one
blend
heroism
which
is
made
out
of
courage
and
magnanimity
very
well
then
which
of
these
elements
does
the
possessor
of
it
manufacture
for
himself
is
it
intellect
y
m
no
o

why

is

is

y
m
no

is

y
m
no
they
are

take
those

the
elemental
moral
qualities
charity
benevolence
magnanimity
kindliness
fruitful
seeds
out
of
which
spring
through
cultivation
by
outside
influences
all
the
manifold
blends
and
combinations
of
virtues
named
in
the
dictionaries
does
man
manufacture
any
of
those
seeds
or
are
they
all

and
the

then
it

now
man
has
been
taught
that
he
is
the
supreme
marvel
of
the
creation
he
believes
it
in
all
the
ages
he
has
never
doubted
it
whether
he
was
a
naked
savage
or
clothed
in
purple
and
fine
linen
and
civilized
this
has
made
his
heart
buoyant
his
life
cheery
his
pride
in
himself
his
sincere
admiration
of
himself
his
joy
in
what
he
supposed
were
his
own
and
unassisted
achievements
and
his
exultation
over
the
praise
and
applause
which
they
evoked
these
have
exalted
him
enthused
him
ambitioned
him
to
higher
and
higher
flights
in
a
word
made
his
life
worth
the
living
but
by
your
scheme
all
this
is
abolished
he
is
degraded
to
a
machine
he
is
a
nobody
his
noble
prides
wither
to
mere
vanities
let
him
strive
as
he
may
he
can
never
be
any
better
than
his
humblest
and
stupidest
neighbor
he
would
never

his

would
not

of

you
never

that
is

nothing

if

them
well
they
are
extremes
abnormals
their
temperaments
are
as
opposite
as
the
poles
their
life
histories
are
about
alike
but
look
at
the
results
their
ages
are
about
the
same
about
around
fifty
burgess
had
always
been
buoyant
hopeful
happy
adams
has
always
been
cheerless
hopeless
despondent
as
young
fellows
both
tried
country
journalism
and
failed
burgess
didn't
seem
to
mind
it
adams
couldn't
smile
he
could
only
mourn
and
groan
over
what
had
happened
and
torture
himself
with
vain
regrets
for
not
having
done
so
and
so
instead
of
so
and
so
then
he
would
have
succeeded
they
tried
the
law
and
failed
burgess
remained
happy
because
he
couldn't
help
it
adams
was
wretched
because
he
couldn't
help
it
from
that
day
to
this
those
two
men
have
gone
on
trying
things
and
failing
burgess
has
come
out
happy
and
cheerful
every
time
adams
the
reverse
and
we
do
absolutely
know
that
these
men's
inborn
temperaments
have
remained
unchanged
through
all
the
vicissitudes
of
their
material
affairs
let
us
see
how
it
is
with
their
immaterials
both
have
been
zealous
democrats
both
have
been
zealous
republicans
both
have
been
zealous
mugwumps
burgess
has
always
found
happiness
and
adams
unhappiness
in
these
several
political
beliefs
and
in
their
migrations
out
of
them
both
of
these
men
have
been
presbyterians
universalists
methodists
catholics
then
presbyterians
again
then
methodists
again
burgess
has
always
found
rest
in
these
excursions
and
adams
unrest
they
are
trying
christian
science
now
with
the
customary
result
the
inevitable
result
no
political
or
religious
belief
can
make
burgess
unhappy
or
the
other
man
happy
i
assure
you
it
is
purely
a
matter
of
temperament
beliefs
are
acquirements
temperaments
are
born
beliefs
are
subject
to
change
nothing
whatever
can
change
temperament
y
m
you
have
instanced
extreme
temperaments
o
m
yes
the
half
dozen
others
are
modifications
of
the
extremes
but
the
law
is
the
same
where
the
temperament
is
two
thirds
happy
or
two
thirds
unhappy
no
political
or
religious
beliefs
can
change
the
proportions
the
vast
majority
of
temperaments
are
pretty
equally
balanced
the
intensities
are
absent
and
this
enables
a
nation
to
learn
to
accommodate
itself
to
its
political
and
religious
circumstances
and
like
them
be
satisfied
with
them
at
last
prefer
them
nations
do
not
think
they
only
feel
they
get
their
feelings
at
second
hand
through
their
temperaments
not
their
brains
a
nation
can
be
brought
by
force
of
circumstances
not
argument
to
reconcile
itself
to
any
kind
of
government
or
religion
that
can
be
devised
in
time
it
will
fit
itself
to
the
required
conditions
later
it
will
prefer
them
and
will
fiercely
fight
for
them
as
instances
you
have
all
history
the
greeks
the
romans
the
persians
the
egyptians
the
russians
the
germans
the
french
the
english
the
spaniards
the
americans
the
south
americans
the
japanese
the
chinese
the
hindus
the
turks
a
thousand
wild
and
tame
religions
every
kind
of
government
that
can
be
thought
of
from
tiger
to
house
cat
each
nation
knowing
it
has
the
only
true
religion
and
the
only
sane
system
of
government
each
despising
all
the
others
each
an
ass
and
not
suspecting
it
each
proud
of
its
fancied
supremacy
each
perfectly
sure
it
is
the
pet
of
god
each
without
undoubting
confidence
summoning
him
to
take
command
in
time
of
war
each
surprised
when
he
goes
over
to
the
enemy
but
by
habit
able
to
excuse
it
and
resume
compliments
in
a
word
the
whole
human
race
content
always
content
persistently
content
indestructibly
content
happy
thankful
proud
no
matter
what
its
religion
is
nor
whether
its
master
be
tiger
or
house
cat
am
i
stating
facts
you
know
i
am
is
the
human
race
cheerful
you
know
it
is
considering
what
it
can
stand
and
be
happy
you
do
me
too
much
honor
when
you
think
that
i
can
place
before
it
a
system
of
plain
cold
facts
that
can
take
the
cheerfulness
out
of
it
nothing
can
do
that
everything
has
been
tried
without
success
i
beg
you
not
to
be
troubled
the
death
of
jean
the
death
of
jean
clemens
occurred
early
in
the
morning
of
december
mr
clemens
was
in
great
stress
of
mind
when
i
first
saw
him
but
a
few
hours
later
i
found
him
writing
steadily
i
am
setting
it
down
he
said
everything
it
is
a
relief
to
me
to
write
it
it
furnishes
me
an
excuse
for
thinking
at
intervals
during
that
day
and
the
next
i
looked
in
and
usually
found
him
writing
then
on
the
evening
of
the
when
he
knew
that
jean
had
been
laid
to
rest
in
elmira
he
came
to
my
room
with
the
manuscript
in
his
hand
i
have
finished
it
he
said
read
it
i
can
form
no
opinion
of
it
myself
if
you
think
it
worthy
some
day
at
the
proper
time
it
can
end
my
autobiography
it
is
the
final
chapter
four
months
later
almost
to
the
day
april
he
was
with
jean
albert
bigelow
paine
stormfield
christmas
eve
a
m
jean
is
dead
has
any
one
ever
tried
to
put
upon
paper
all
the
little
happenings
connected
with
a
dear
one
happenings
of
the
twenty
four
hours
preceding
the
sudden
and
unexpected
death
of
that
dear
one
would
a
book
contain
them
would
two
books
contain
them
i
think
not
they
pour
into
the
mind
in
a
flood
they
are
little
things
that
have
been
always
happening
every
day
and
were
always
so
unimportant
and
easily
forgettable
before
but
now
now
how
different
how
precious
they
are
how
dear
how
unforgettable
how
pathetic
how
sacred
how
clothed
with
dignity
last
night
jean
all
flushed
with
splendid
health
and
i
the
same
from
the
wholesome
effects
of
my
bermuda
holiday
strolled
hand
in
hand
from
the
dinner
table
and
sat
down
in
the
library
and
chatted
and
planned
and
discussed
cheerily
and
happily
and
how
unsuspectingly
until
nine
which
is
late
for
us
then
went
upstairs
jean's
friendly
german
dog
following
at
my
door
jean
said
i
can't
kiss
you
good
night
father
i
have
a
cold
and
you
could
catch
it
i
bent
and
kissed
her
hand
she
was
moved
i
saw
it
in
her
eyes
and
she
impulsively
kissed
my
hand
in
return
then
with
the
usual
gay
sleep
well
dear
from
both
we
parted
at
half
past
seven
this
morning
i
woke
and
heard
voices
outside
my
door
i
said
to
myself
jean
is
starting
on
her
usual
horseback
flight
to
the
station
for
the
mail
then
katy
entered
stood
quaking
and
gasping
at
my
bedside
a
moment
then
found
her
tongue
miss
jean
is
dead
possibly
i
know
now
what
the
soldier
feels
when
a
bullet
crashes
through
his
heart
in
her
bathroom
there
she
lay
the
fair
young
creature
stretched
upon
the
floor
and
covered
with
a
sheet
and
looking
so
placid
so
natural
and
as
if
asleep
we
knew
what
had
happened
she
was
an
epileptic
she
had
been
seized
with
a
convulsion
and
heart
failure
in
her
bath
the
doctor
had
to
come
several
miles
his
efforts
like
our
previous
ones
failed
to
bring
her
back
to
life
it
is
noon
now
how
lovable
she
looks
how
sweet
and
how
tranquil
it
is
a
noble
face
and
full
of
dignity
and
that
was
a
good
heart
that
lies
there
so
still
in
england
thirteen
years
ago
my
wife
and
i
were
stabbed
to
the
heart
with
a
cablegram
which
said
susy
was
mercifully
released
today
i
had
to
send
a
like
shot
to
clara
in
berlin
this
morning
with
the
peremptory
addition
you
must
not
come
home
clara
and
her
husband
sailed
from
here
on
the
of
this
month
how
will
clara
bear
it
jean
from
her
babyhood
was
a
worshiper
of
clara
four
days
ago
i
came
back
from
a
month's
holiday
in
bermuda
in
perfected
health
but
by
some
accident
the
reporters
failed
to
perceive
this
day
before
yesterday
letters
and
telegrams
began
to
arrive
from
friends
and
strangers
which
indicated
that
i
was
supposed
to
be
dangerously
ill
yesterday
jean
begged
me
to
explain
my
case
through
the
associated
press
i
said
it
was
not
important
enough
but
she
was
distressed
and
said
i
must
think
of
clara
clara
would
see
the
report
in
the
german
papers
and
as
she
had
been
nursing
her
husband
day
and
night
for
four
months
and
was
worn
out
and
feeble
the
shock
might
be
disastrous
there
was
reason
in
that
so
i
sent
a
humorous
paragraph
by
telephone
to
the
associated
press
denying
the
charge
that
i
was
dying
and
saying
i
would
not
do
such
a
thing
at
my
time
of
life
jean
was
a
little
troubled
and
did
not
like
to
see
me
treat
the
matter
so
lightly
but
i
said
it
was
best
to
treat
it
so
for
there
was
nothing
serious
about
it
this
morning
i
sent
the
sorrowful
facts
of
this
day's
irremediable
disaster
to
the
associated
press
will
both
appear
in
this
evening's
papers
the
one
so
blithe
the
other
so
tragic
i
lost
susy
thirteen
years
ago
i
lost
her
mother
her
incomparable
mother
five
and
a
half
years
ago
clara
has
gone
away
to
live
in
europe
and
now
i
have
lost
jean
how
poor
i
am
who
was
once
so
rich
seven
months
ago
mr
rogers
died
one
of
the
best
friends
i
ever
had
and
the
nearest
perfect
as
man
and
gentleman
i
have
yet
met
among
my
race
within
the
last
six
weeks
gilder
has
passed
away
and
laffan
old
old
friends
of
mine
jean
lies
yonder
i
sit
here
we
are
strangers
under
our
own
roof
we
kissed
hands
good
by
at
this
door
last
night
and
it
was
forever
we
never
suspecting
it
she
lies
there
and
i
sit
here
writing
busying
myself
to
keep
my
heart
from
breaking
how
dazzlingly
the
sunshine
is
flooding
the
hills
around
it
is
like
a
mockery
seventy
four
years
old
twenty
four
days
ago
seventy
four
years
old
yesterday
who
can
estimate
my
age
today
i
have
looked
upon
her
again
i
wonder
i
can
bear
it
she
looks
just
as
her
mother
looked
when
she
lay
dead
in
that
florentine
villa
so
long
ago
the
sweet
placidity
of
death
it
is
more
beautiful
than
sleep
i
saw
her
mother
buried
i
said
i
would
never
endure
that
horror
again
that
i
would
never
again
look
into
the
grave
of
any
one
dear
to
me
i
have
kept
to
that
they
will
take
jean
from
this
house
tomorrow
and
bear
her
to
elmira
new
york
where
lie
those
of
us
that
have
been
released
but
i
shall
not
follow
jean
was
on
the
dock
when
the
ship
came
in
only
four
days
ago
she
was
at
the
door
beaming
a
welcome
when
i
reached
this
house
the
next
evening
we
played
cards
and
she
tried
to
teach
me
a
new
game
called
mark
twain
we
sat
chatting
cheerily
in
the
library
last
night
and
she
wouldn't
let
me
look
into
the
loggia
where
she
was
making
christmas
preparations
she
said
she
would
finish
them
in
the
morning
and
then
her
little
french
friend
would
arrive
from
new
york
the
surprise
would
follow
the
surprise
she
had
been
working
over
for
days
while
she
was
out
for
a
moment
i
disloyally
stole
a
look
the
loggia
floor
was
clothed
with
rugs
and
furnished
with
chairs
and
sofas
and
the
uncompleted
surprise
was
there
in
the
form
of
a
christmas
tree
that
was
drenched
with
silver
film
in
a
most
wonderful
way
and
on
a
table
was
a
prodigal
profusion
of
bright
things
which
she
was
going
to
hang
upon
it
today
what
desecrating
hand
will
ever
banish
that
eloquent
unfinished
surprise
from
that
place
not
mine
surely
all
these
little
matters
have
happened
in
the
last
four
days
little
yes
then
but
not
now
nothing
she
said
or
thought
or
did
is
little
now
and
all
the
lavish
humor
what
is
become
of
it
it
is
pathos
now
pathos
and
the
thought
of
it
brings
tears
all
these
little
things
happened
such
a
few
hours
ago
and
now
she
lies
yonder
lies
yonder
and
cares
for
nothing
any
more
strange
marvelous
incredible
i
have
had
this
experience
before
but
it
would
still
be
incredible
if
i
had
had
it
a
thousand
times
miss
jean
is
dead
that
is
what
katy
said
when
i
heard
the
door
open
behind
the
bed's
head
without
a
preliminary
knock
i
supposed
it
was
jean
coming
to
kiss
me
good
morning
she
being
the
only
person
who
was
used
to
entering
without
formalities
and
so
i
have
been
to
jean's
parlor
such
a
turmoil
of
christmas
presents
for
servants
and
friends
they
are
everywhere
tables
chairs
sofas
the
floor
everything
is
occupied
and
over
occupied
it
is
many
and
many
a
year
since
i
have
seen
the
like
in
that
ancient
day
mrs
clemens
and
i
used
to
slip
softly
into
the
nursery
at
midnight
on
christmas
eve
and
look
the
array
of
presents
over
the
children
were
little
then
and
now
here
is
jean's
parlor
looking
just
as
that
nursery
used
to
look
the
presents
are
not
labeled
the
hands
are
forever
idle
that
would
have
labeled
them
today
jean's
mother
always
worked
herself
down
with
her
christmas
preparations
jean
did
the
same
yesterday
and
the
preceding
days
and
the
fatigue
has
cost
her
her
life
the
fatigue
caused
the
convulsion
that
attacked
her
this
morning
she
had
had
no
attack
for
months
jean
was
so
full
of
life
and
energy
that
she
was
constantly
in
danger
of
overtaxing
her
strength
every
morning
she
was
in
the
saddle
by
half
past
seven
and
off
to
the
station
for
her
mail
she
examined
the
letters
and
i
distributed
them
some
to
her
some
to
mr
paine
the
others
to
the
stenographer
and
myself
she
dispatched
her
share
and
then
mounted
her
horse
again
and
went
around
superintending
her
farm
and
her
poultry
the
rest
of
the
day
sometimes
she
played
billiards
with
me
after
dinner
but
she
was
usually
too
tired
to
play
and
went
early
to
bed
yesterday
afternoon
i
told
her
about
some
plans
i
had
been
devising
while
absent
in
bermuda
to
lighten
her
burdens
we
would
get
a
housekeeper
also
we
would
put
her
share
of
the
secretary
work
into
mr
paine's
hands
no
she
wasn't
willing
she
had
been
making
plans
herself
the
matter
ended
in
a
compromise
i
submitted
i
always
did
she
wouldn't
audit
the
bills
and
let
paine
fill
out
the
checks
she
would
continue
to
attend
to
that
herself
also
she
would
continue
to
be
housekeeper
and
let
katy
assist
also
she
would
continue
to
answer
the
letters
of
personal
friends
for
me
such
was
the
compromise
both
of
us
called
it
by
that
name
though
i
was
not
able
to
see
where
any
formidable
change
had
been
made
however
jean
was
pleased
and
that
was
sufficient
for
me
she
was
proud
of
being
my
secretary
and
i
was
never
able
to
persuade
her
to
give
up
any
part
of
her
share
in
that
unlovely
work
in
the
talk
last
night
i
said
i
found
everything
going
so
smoothly
that
if
she
were
willing
i
would
go
back
to
bermuda
in
february
and
get
blessedly
out
of
the
clash
and
turmoil
again
for
another
month
she
was
urgent
that
i
should
do
it
and
said
that
if
i
would
put
off
the
trip
until
march
she
would
take
katy
and
go
with
me
we
struck
hands
upon
that
and
said
it
was
settled
i
had
a
mind
to
write
to
bermuda
by
tomorrow's
ship
and
secure
a
furnished
house
and
servants
i
meant
to
write
the
letter
this
morning
but
it
will
never
be
written
now
for
she
lies
yonder
and
before
her
is
another
journey
than
that
night
is
closing
down
the
rim
of
the
sun
barely
shows
above
the
sky
line
of
the
hills
i
have
been
looking
at
that
face
again
that
was
growing
dearer
and
dearer
to
me
every
day
i
was
getting
acquainted
with
jean
in
these
last
nine
months
she
had
been
long
an
exile
from
home
when
she
came
to
us
three
quarters
of
a
year
ago
she
had
been
shut
up
in
sanitariums
many
miles
from
us
how
eloquently
glad
and
grateful
she
was
to
cross
her
father's
threshold
again
would
i
bring
her
back
to
life
if
i
could
do
it
i
would
not
if
a
word
would
do
it
i
would
beg
for
strength
to
withhold
the
word
and
i
would
have
the
strength
i
am
sure
of
it
in
her
loss
i
am
almost
bankrupt
and
my
life
is
a
bitterness
but
i
am
content
for
she
has
been
enriched
with
the
most
precious
of
all
gifts
that
gift
which
makes
all
other
gifts
mean
and
poor
death
i
have
never
wanted
any
released
friend
of
mine
restored
to
life
since
i
reached
manhood
i
felt
in
this
way
when
susy
passed
away
and
later
my
wife
and
later
mr
rogers
when
clara
met
me
at
the
station
in
new
york
and
told
me
mr
rogers
had
died
suddenly
that
morning
my
thought
was
oh
favorite
of
fortune
fortunate
all
his
long
and
lovely
life
fortunate
to
his
latest
moment
the
reporters
said
there
were
tears
of
sorrow
in
my
eyes
true
but
they
were
for
me
not
for
him
he
had
suffered
no
loss
all
the
fortunes
he
had
ever
made
before
were
poverty
compared
with
this
one
why
did
i
build
this
house
two
years
ago
to
shelter
this
vast
emptiness
how
foolish
i
was
but
i
shall
stay
in
it
the
spirits
of
the
dead
hallow
a
house
for
me
it
was
not
so
with
other
members
of
my
family
susy
died
in
the
house
we
built
in
hartford
mrs
clemens
would
never
enter
it
again
but
it
made
the
house
dearer
to
me
i
have
entered
it
once
since
when
it
was
tenantless
and
silent
and
forlorn
but
to
me
it
was
a
holy
place
and
beautiful
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
spirits
of
the
dead
were
all
about
me
and
would
speak
to
me
and
welcome
me
if
they
could
livy
and
susy
and
george
and
henry
robinson
and
charles
dudley
warner
how
good
and
kind
they
were
and
how
lovable
their
lives
in
fancy
i
could
see
them
all
again
i
could
call
the
children
back
and
hear
them
romp
again
with
george
that
peerless
black
ex
slave
and
children's
idol
who
came
one
day
a
flitting
stranger
to
wash
windows
and
stayed
eighteen
years
until
he
died
clara
and
jean
would
never
enter
again
the
new
york
hotel
which
their
mother
had
frequented
in
earlier
days
they
could
not
bear
it
but
i
shall
stay
in
this
house
it
is
dearer
to
me
tonight
than
ever
it
was
before
jean's
spirit
will
make
it
beautiful
for
me
always
her
lonely
and
tragic
death
but
i
will
not
think
of
that
now
jean's
mother
always
devoted
two
or
three
weeks
to
christmas
shopping
and
was
always
physically
exhausted
when
christmas
eve
came
jean
was
her
very
own
child
she
wore
herself
out
present
hunting
in
new
york
these
latter
days
paine
has
just
found
on
her
desk
a
long
list
of
names
fifty
he
thinks
people
to
whom
she
sent
presents
last
night
apparently
she
forgot
no
one
and
katy
found
there
a
roll
of
bank
notes
for
the
servants
her
dog
has
been
wandering
about
the
grounds
today
comradeless
and
forlorn
i
have
seen
him
from
the
windows
she
got
him
from
germany
he
has
tall
ears
and
looks
exactly
like
a
wolf
he
was
educated
in
germany
and
knows
no
language
but
the
german
jean
gave
him
no
orders
save
in
that
tongue
and
so
when
the
burglar
alarm
made
a
fierce
clamor
at
midnight
a
fortnight
ago
the
butler
who
is
french
and
knows
no
german
tried
in
vain
to
interest
the
dog
in
the
supposed
burglar
jean
wrote
me
to
bermuda
about
the
incident
it
was
the
last
letter
i
was
ever
to
receive
from
her
bright
head
and
her
competent
hand
the
dog
will
not
be
neglected
there
was
never
a
kinder
heart
than
jean's
from
her
childhood
up
she
always
spent
the
most
of
her
allowance
on
charities
of
one
kind
and
another
after
she
became
secretary
and
had
her
income
doubled
she
spent
her
money
upon
these
things
with
a
free
hand
mine
too
i
am
glad
and
grateful
to
say
she
was
a
loyal
friend
to
all
animals
and
she
loved
them
all
birds
beasts
and
everything
even
snakes
an
inheritance
from
me
she
knew
all
the
birds
she
was
high
up
in
that
lore
she
became
a
member
of
various
humane
societies
when
she
was
still
a
little
girl
both
here
and
abroad
and
she
remained
an
active
member
to
the
last
she
founded
two
or
three
societies
for
the
protection
of
animals
here
and
in
europe
she
was
an
embarrassing
secretary
for
she
fished
my
correspondence
out
of
the
waste
basket
and
answered
the
letters
she
thought
all
letters
deserved
the
courtesy
of
an
answer
her
mother
brought
her
up
in
that
kindly
error
she
could
write
a
good
letter
and
was
swift
with
her
pen
she
had
but
an
indifferent
ear
for
music
but
her
tongue
took
to
languages
with
an
easy
facility
she
never
allowed
her
italian
french
and
german
to
get
rusty
through
neglect
the
telegrams
of
sympathy
are
flowing
in
from
far
and
wide
now
just
as
they
did
in
italy
five
years
and
a
half
ago
when
this
child's
mother
laid
down
her
blameless
life
they
cannot
heal
the
hurt
but
they
take
away
some
of
the
pain
when
jean
and
i
kissed
hands
and
parted
at
my
door
last
how
little
did
we
imagine
that
in
twenty
two
hours
the
telegraph
would
be
bringing
words
like
these
from
the
bottom
of
our
hearts
we
send
our
sympathy
dearest
of
friends
for
many
and
many
a
day
to
come
wherever
i
go
in
this
house
remembrancers
of
jean
will
mutely
speak
to
me
of
her
who
can
count
the
number
of
them
she
was
in
exile
two
years
with
the
hope
of
healing
her
malady
epilepsy
there
are
no
words
to
express
how
grateful
i
am
that
she
did
not
meet
her
fate
in
the
hands
of
strangers
but
in
the
loving
shelter
of
her
own
home
miss
jean
is
dead
it
is
true
jean
is
dead
a
month
ago
i
was
writing
bubbling
and
hilarious
articles
for
magazines
yet
to
appear
and
now
i
am
writing
this
christmas
day
noon
last
night
i
went
to
jean's
room
at
intervals
and
turned
back
the
sheet
and
looked
at
the
peaceful
face
and
kissed
the
cold
brow
and
remembered
that
heartbreaking
night
in
florence
so
long
ago
in
that
cavernous
and
silent
vast
villa
when
i
crept
downstairs
so
many
times
and
turned
back
a
sheet
and
looked
at
a
face
just
like
this
one
jean's
mother's
face
and
kissed
a
brow
that
was
just
like
this
one
and
last
night
i
saw
again
what
i
had
seen
then
that
strange
and
lovely
miracle
the
sweet
soft
contours
of
early
maidenhood
restored
by
the
gracious
hand
of
death
when
jean's
mother
lay
dead
all
trace
of
care
and
trouble
and
suffering
and
the
corroding
years
had
vanished
out
of
the
face
and
i
was
looking
again
upon
it
as
i
had
known
and
worshiped
it
in
its
young
bloom
and
beauty
a
whole
generation
before
about
three
in
the
morning
while
wandering
about
the
house
in
the
deep
silences
as
one
does
in
times
like
these
when
there
is
a
dumb
sense
that
something
has
been
lost
that
will
never
be
found
again
yet
must
be
sought
if
only
for
the
employment
the
useless
seeking
gives
i
came
upon
jean's
dog
in
the
hall
downstairs
and
noted
that
he
did
not
spring
to
greet
me
according
to
his
hospitable
habit
but
came
slow
and
sorrowfully
also
i
remembered
that
he
had
not
visited
jean's
apartment
since
the
tragedy
poor
fellow
did
he
know
i
think
so
always
when
jean
was
abroad
in
the
open
he
was
with
her
always
when
she
was
in
the
house
he
was
with
her
in
the
night
as
well
as
in
the
day
her
parlor
was
his
bedroom
whenever
i
happened
upon
him
on
the
ground
floor
he
always
followed
me
about
and
when
i
went
upstairs
he
went
too
in
a
tumultuous
gallop
but
now
it
was
different
after
patting
him
a
little
i
went
to
the
library
he
remained
behind
when
i
went
upstairs
he
did
not
follow
me
save
with
his
wistful
eyes
he
has
wonderful
eyes
big
and
kind
and
eloquent
he
can
talk
with
them
he
is
a
beautiful
creature
and
is
of
the
breed
of
the
new
york
police
dogs
i
do
not
like
dogs
because
they
bark
when
there
is
no
occasion
for
it
but
i
have
liked
this
one
from
the
beginning
because
he
belonged
to
jean
and
because
he
never
barks
except
when
there
is
occasion
which
is
not
oftener
than
twice
a
week
in
my
wanderings
i
visited
jean's
parlor
on
a
shelf
i
found
a
pile
of
my
books
and
i
knew
what
it
meant
she
was
waiting
for
me
to
come
home
from
bermuda
and
autograph
them
then
she
would
send
them
away
if
i
only
knew
whom
she
intended
them
for
but
i
shall
never
know
i
will
keep
them
her
hand
has
touched
them
it
is
an
accolade
they
are
noble
now
and
in
a
closet
she
had
hidden
a
surprise
for
me
a
thing
i
have
often
wished
i
owned
a
noble
big
globe
i
couldn't
see
it
for
the
tears
she
will
never
know
the
pride
i
take
in
it
and
the
pleasure
today
the
mails
are
full
of
loving
remembrances
for
her
full
of
those
old
old
kind
words
she
loved
so
well
merry
christmas
to
jean
if
she
could
only
have
lived
one
day
longer
at
last
she
ran
out
of
money
and
would
not
use
mine
so
she
sent
to
one
of
those
new
york
homes
for
poor
girls
all
the
clothes
she
could
spare
and
more
most
likely
christmas
night
this
afternoon
they
took
her
away
from
her
room
as
soon
as
i
might
i
went
down
to
the
library
and
there
she
lay
in
her
coffin
dressed
in
exactly
the
same
clothes
she
wore
when
she
stood
at
the
other
end
of
the
same
room
on
the
of
october
last
as
clara's
chief
bridesmaid
her
face
was
radiant
with
happy
excitement
then
it
was
the
same
face
now
with
the
dignity
of
death
and
the
peace
of
god
upon
it
they
told
me
the
first
mourner
to
come
was
the
dog
he
came
uninvited
and
stood
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
rested
his
fore
paws
upon
the
trestle
and
took
a
last
long
look
at
the
face
that
was
so
dear
to
him
then
went
his
way
as
silently
as
he
had
come
he
knows
at
mid
afternoon
it
began
to
snow
the
pity
of
it
that
jean
could
not
see
it
she
so
loved
the
snow
the
snow
continued
to
fall
at
six
o'clock
the
hearse
drew
up
to
the
door
to
bear
away
its
pathetic
burden
as
they
lifted
the
casket
paine
began
playing
on
the
orchestrelle
schubert's
impromptu
which
was
jean's
favorite
then
he
played
the
intermezzo
that
was
for
susy
then
he
played
the
largo
that
was
for
their
mother
he
did
this
at
my
request
elsewhere
in
my
autobiography
i
have
told
how
the
intermezzo
and
the
largo
came
to
be
associated
in
my
heart
with
susy
and
livy
in
their
last
hours
in
this
life
from
my
windows
i
saw
the
hearse
and
the
carriages
wind
along
the
road
and
gradually
grow
vague
and
spectral
in
the
falling
snow
and
presently
disappear
jean
was
gone
out
of
my
life
and
would
not
come
back
any
more
jervis
the
cousin
she
had
played
with
when
they
were
babies
together
he
and
her
beloved
old
katy
were
conducting
her
to
her
distant
childhood
home
where
she
will
lie
by
her
mother's
side
once
more
in
the
company
of
susy
and
langdon
december
the
dog
came
to
see
me
at
eight
o'clock
this
morning
he
was
very
affectionate
poor
orphan
my
room
will
be
his
quarters
hereafter
the
storm
raged
all
night
it
has
raged
all
the
morning
the
snow
drives
across
the
landscape
in
vast
clouds
superb
sublime
and
jean
not
here
to
see
p
m
it
is
the
time
appointed
the
funeral
has
begun
four
hundred
miles
away
but
i
can
see
it
all
just
as
if
i
were
there
the
scene
is
the
library
in
the
langdon
homestead
jean's
coffin
stands
where
her
mother
and
i
stood
forty
years
ago
and
were
married
and
where
susy's
coffin
stood
thirteen
years
ago
where
her
mother's
stood
five
years
and
a
half
ago
and
where
mine
will
stand
after
a
little
time
five
o'clock
it
is
all
over
when
clara
went
away
two
weeks
ago
to
live
in
europe
it
was
hard
but
i
could
bear
it
for
i
had
jean
left
i
said
we
would
be
a
family
we
said
we
would
be
close
comrades
and
happy
just
we
two
that
fair
dream
was
in
my
mind
when
jean
met
me
at
the
steamer
last
monday
it
was
in
my
mind
when
she
received
me
at
the
door
last
tuesday
evening
we
were
together
we
were
a
family
the
dream
had
come
true
oh
precisely
true
contentedly
true
satisfyingly
true
and
remained
true
two
whole
days
and
now
now
jean
is
in
her
grave
in
the
grave
if
i
can
believe
it
god
rest
her
sweet
spirit
katy
leary
who
had
been
in
the
service
of
the
clemens
family
for
twenty
nine
years
mr
gabrilowitsch
had
been
operated
on
for
appendicitis
the
turning
point
of
my
life
i
if
i
understand
the
idea
the
bazar
invites
several
of
us
to
write
upon
the
above
text
it
means
the
change
in
my
life's
course
which
introduced
what
must
be
regarded
by
me
as
the
most
important
condition
of
my
career
but
it
also
implies
without
intention
perhaps
that
that
turning
point
itself
was
the
creator
of
the
new
condition
this
gives
it
too
much
distinction
too
much
prominence
too
much
credit
it
is
only
the
last
link
in
a
very
long
chain
of
turning
points
commissioned
to
produce
the
cardinal
result
it
is
not
any
more
important
than
the
humblest
of
its
ten
thousand
predecessors
each
of
the
ten
thousand
did
its
appointed
share
on
its
appointed
date
in
forwarding
the
scheme
and
they
were
all
necessary
to
have
left
out
any
one
of
them
would
have
defeated
the
scheme
and
brought
about
some
other
result
i
know
we
have
a
fashion
of
saying
such
and
such
an
event
was
the
turning
point
in
my
life
but
we
shouldn't
say
it
we
should
merely
grant
that
its
place
as
last
link
in
the
chain
makes
it
the
most
conspicuous
link
in
real
importance
it
has
no
advantage
over
any
one
of
its
predecessors
perhaps
the
most
celebrated
turning
point
recorded
in
history
was
the
crossing
of
the
rubicon
suetonius
says
coming
up
with
his
troops
on
the
banks
of
the
rubicon
he
halted
for
a
while
and
revolving
in
his
mind
the
importance
of
the
step
he
was
on
the
point
of
taking
he
turned
to
those
about
him
and
said
we
may
still
retreat
but
if
we
pass
this
little
bridge
nothing
is
left
for
us
but
to
fight
it
out
in
arms
this
was
a
stupendously
important
moment
and
all
the
incidents
big
and
little
of
caesar's
previous
life
had
been
leading
up
to
it
stage
by
stage
link
by
link
this
was
the
last
link
merely
the
last
one
and
no
bigger
than
the
others
but
as
we
gaze
back
at
it
through
the
inflating
mists
of
our
imagination
it
looks
as
big
as
the
orbit
of
neptune
you
the
reader
have
a
personal
interest
in
that
link
and
so
have
i
so
has
the
rest
of
the
human
race
it
was
one
of
the
links
in
your
life
chain
and
it
was
one
of
the
links
in
mine
we
may
wait
now
with
bated
breath
while
caesar
reflects
your
fate
and
mine
are
involved
in
his
decision
while
he
was
thus
hesitating
the
following
incident
occurred
a
person
remarked
for
his
noble
mien
and
graceful
aspect
appeared
close
at
hand
sitting
and
playing
upon
a
pipe
when
not
only
the
shepherds
but
a
number
of
soldiers
also
flocked
to
listen
to
him
and
some
trumpeters
among
them
he
snatched
a
trumpet
from
one
of
them
ran
to
the
river
with
it
and
sounding
the
advance
with
a
piercing
blast
crossed
to
the
other
side
upon
this
caesar
exclaimed
let
us
go
whither
the
omens
of
the
gods
and
the
iniquity
of
our
enemies
call
us
the
die
is
cast
so
he
crossed
and
changed
the
future
of
the
whole
human
race
for
all
time
but
that
stranger
was
a
link
in
caesar's
life
chain
too
and
a
necessary
one
we
don't
know
his
name
we
never
hear
of
him
again
he
was
very
casual
he
acts
like
an
accident
but
he
was
no
accident
he
was
there
by
compulsion
of
his
life
chain
to
blow
the
electrifying
blast
that
was
to
make
up
caesar's
mind
for
him
and
thence
go
piping
down
the
aisles
of
history
forever
if
the
stranger
hadn't
been
there
but
he
was
and
caesar
crossed
with
such
results
such
vast
events
each
a
link
in
the
human
race's
life
chain
each
event
producing
the
next
one
and
that
one
the
next
one
and
so
on
the
destruction
of
the
republic
the
founding
of
the
empire
the
breaking
up
of
the
empire
the
rise
of
christianity
upon
its
ruins
the
spread
of
the
religion
to
other
lands
and
so
on
link
by
link
took
its
appointed
place
at
its
appointed
time
the
discovery
of
america
being
one
of
them
our
revolution
another
the
inflow
of
english
and
other
immigrants
another
their
drift
westward
my
ancestors
among
them
another
the
settlement
of
certain
of
them
in
missouri
which
resulted
in
me
for
i
was
one
of
the
unavoidable
results
of
the
crossing
of
the
rubicon
if
the
stranger
with
his
trumpet
blast
had
stayed
away
which
he
couldn't
for
he
was
an
appointed
link
caesar
would
not
have
crossed
what
would
have
happened
in
that
case
we
can
never
guess
we
only
know
that
the
things
that
did
happen
would
not
have
happened
they
might
have
been
replaced
by
equally
prodigious
things
of
course
but
their
nature
and
results
are
beyond
our
guessing
but
the
matter
that
interests
me
personally
is
that
i
would
not
be
here
now
but
somewhere
else
and
probably
black
there
is
no
telling
very
well
i
am
glad
he
crossed
and
very
really
and
thankfully
glad
too
though
i
never
cared
anything
about
it
before
ii
to
me
the
most
important
feature
of
my
life
is
its
literary
feature
i
have
been
professionally
literary
something
more
than
forty
years
there
have
been
many
turning
points
in
my
life
but
the
one
that
was
the
last
link
in
the
chain
appointed
to
conduct
me
to
the
literary
guild
is
the
most
conspicuous
link
in
that
chain
because
it
was
the
last
one
it
was
not
any
more
important
than
its
predecessors
all
the
other
links
have
an
inconspicuous
look
except
the
crossing
of
the
rubicon
but
as
factors
in
making
me
literary
they
are
all
of
the
one
size
the
crossing
of
the
rubicon
included
i
know
how
i
came
to
be
literary
and
i
will
tell
the
steps
that
lead
up
to
it
and
brought
it
about
the
crossing
of
the
rubicon
was
not
the
first
one
it
was
hardly
even
a
recent
one
i
should
have
to
go
back
ages
before
caesar's
day
to
find
the
first
one
to
save
space
i
will
go
back
only
a
couple
of
generations
and
start
with
an
incident
of
my
boyhood
when
i
was
twelve
and
a
half
years
old
my
father
died
it
was
in
the
spring
the
summer
came
and
brought
with
it
an
epidemic
of
measles
for
a
time
a
child
died
almost
every
day
the
village
was
paralyzed
with
fright
distress
despair
children
that
were
not
smitten
with
the
disease
were
imprisoned
in
their
homes
to
save
them
from
the
infection
in
the
homes
there
were
no
cheerful
faces
there
was
no
music
there
was
no
singing
but
of
solemn
hymns
no
voice
but
of
prayer
no
romping
was
allowed
no
noise
no
laughter
the
family
moved
spectrally
about
on
tiptoe
in
a
ghostly
hush
i
was
a
prisoner
my
soul
was
steeped
in
this
awful
dreariness
and
in
fear
at
some
time
or
other
every
day
and
every
night
a
sudden
shiver
shook
me
to
the
marrow
and
i
said
to
myself
there
i've
got
it
and
i
shall
die
life
on
these
miserable
terms
was
not
worth
living
and
at
last
i
made
up
my
mind
to
get
the
disease
and
have
it
over
one
way
or
the
other
i
escaped
from
the
house
and
went
to
the
house
of
a
neighbor
where
a
playmate
of
mine
was
very
ill
with
the
malady
when
the
chance
offered
i
crept
into
his
room
and
got
into
bed
with
him
i
was
discovered
by
his
mother
and
sent
back
into
captivity
but
i
had
the
disease
they
could
not
take
that
from
me
i
came
near
to
dying
the
whole
village
was
interested
and
anxious
and
sent
for
news
of
me
every
day
and
not
only
once
a
day
but
several
times
everybody
believed
i
would
die
but
on
the
fourteenth
day
a
change
came
for
the
worse
and
they
were
disappointed
this
was
a
turning
point
of
my
life
link
number
one
for
when
i
got
well
my
mother
closed
my
school
career
and
apprenticed
me
to
a
printer
she
was
tired
of
trying
to
keep
me
out
of
mischief
and
the
adventure
of
the
measles
decided
her
to
put
me
into
more
masterful
hands
than
hers
i
became
a
printer
and
began
to
add
one
link
after
another
to
the
chain
which
was
to
lead
me
into
the
literary
profession
a
long
road
but
i
could
not
know
that
and
as
i
did
not
know
what
its
goal
was
or
even
that
it
had
one
i
was
indifferent
also
contented
a
young
printer
wanders
around
a
good
deal
seeking
and
finding
work
and
seeking
again
when
necessity
commands
n
b
necessity
is
a
circumstance
circumstance
is
man's
master
and
when
circumstance
commands
he
must
obey
he
may
argue
the
matter
that
is
his
privilege
just
as
it
is
the
honorable
privilege
of
a
falling
body
to
argue
with
the
attraction
of
gravitation
but
it
won't
do
any
good
he
must
obey
i
wandered
for
ten
years
under
the
guidance
and
dictatorship
of
circumstance
and
finally
arrived
in
a
city
of
iowa
where
i
worked
several
months
among
the
books
that
interested
me
in
those
days
was
one
about
the
amazon
the
traveler
told
an
alluring
tale
of
his
long
voyage
up
the
great
river
from
para
to
the
sources
of
the
madeira
through
the
heart
of
an
enchanted
land
a
land
wastefully
rich
in
tropical
wonders
a
romantic
land
where
all
the
birds
and
flowers
and
animals
were
of
the
museum
varieties
and
where
the
alligator
and
the
crocodile
and
the
monkey
seemed
as
much
at
home
as
if
they
were
in
the
zoo
also
he
told
an
astonishing
tale
about
coca
a
vegetable
product
of
miraculous
powers
asserting
that
it
was
so
nourishing
and
so
strength
giving
that
the
native
of
the
mountains
of
the
madeira
region
would
tramp
up
hill
and
down
all
day
on
a
pinch
of
powdered
coca
and
require
no
other
sustenance
i
was
fired
with
a
longing
to
ascend
the
amazon
also
with
a
longing
to
open
up
a
trade
in
coca
with
all
the
world
during
months
i
dreamed
that
dream
and
tried
to
contrive
ways
to
get
to
para
and
spring
that
splendid
enterprise
upon
an
unsuspecting
planet
but
all
in
vain
a
person
may
plan
as
much
as
he
wants
to
but
nothing
of
consequence
is
likely
to
come
of
it
until
the
magician
circumstance
steps
in
and
takes
the
matter
off
his
hands
at
last
circumstance
came
to
my
help
it
was
in
this
way
circumstance
to
help
or
hurt
another
man
made
him
lose
a
fifty
dollar
bill
in
the
street
and
to
help
or
hurt
me
made
me
find
it
i
advertised
the
find
and
left
for
the
amazon
the
same
day
this
was
another
turning
point
another
link
could
circumstance
have
ordered
another
dweller
in
that
town
to
go
to
the
amazon
and
open
up
a
world
trade
in
coca
on
a
fifty
dollar
basis
and
been
obeyed
no
i
was
the
only
one
there
were
other
fools
there
shoals
and
shoals
of
them
but
they
were
not
of
my
kind
i
was
the
only
one
of
my
kind
circumstance
is
powerful
but
it
cannot
work
alone
it
has
to
have
a
partner
its
partner
is
man's
temperament
his
natural
disposition
his
temperament
is
not
his
invention
it
is
born
in
him
and
he
has
no
authority
over
it
neither
is
he
responsible
for
its
acts
he
cannot
change
it
nothing
can
change
it
nothing
can
modify
it
except
temporarily
but
it
won't
stay
modified
it
is
permanent
like
the
color
of
the
man's
eyes
and
the
shape
of
his
ears
blue
eyes
are
gray
in
certain
unusual
lights
but
they
resume
their
natural
color
when
that
stress
is
removed
a
circumstance
that
will
coerce
one
man
will
have
no
effect
upon
a
man
of
a
different
temperament
if
circumstance
had
thrown
the
bank
note
in
caesar's
way
his
temperament
would
not
have
made
him
start
for
the
amazon
his
temperament
would
have
compelled
him
to
do
something
with
the
money
but
not
that
it
might
have
made
him
advertise
the
note
and
wait
we
can't
tell
also
it
might
have
made
him
go
to
new
york
and
buy
into
the
government
with
results
that
would
leave
tweed
nothing
to
learn
when
it
came
his
turn
very
well
circumstance
furnished
the
capital
and
my
temperament
told
me
what
to
do
with
it
sometimes
a
temperament
is
an
ass
when
that
is
the
case
the
owner
of
it
is
an
ass
too
and
is
going
to
remain
one
training
experience
association
can
temporarily
so
polish
him
improve
him
exalt
him
that
people
will
think
he
is
a
mule
but
they
will
be
mistaken
artificially
he
is
a
mule
for
the
time
being
but
at
bottom
he
is
an
ass
yet
and
will
remain
one
by
temperament
i
was
the
kind
of
person
that
does
things
does
them
and
reflects
afterward
so
i
started
for
the
amazon
without
reflecting
and
without
asking
any
questions
that
was
more
than
fifty
years
ago
in
all
that
time
my
temperament
has
not
changed
by
even
a
shade
i
have
been
punished
many
and
many
a
time
and
bitterly
for
doing
things
and
reflecting
afterward
but
these
tortures
have
been
of
no
value
to
me
i
still
do
the
thing
commanded
by
circumstance
and
temperament
and
reflect
afterward
always
violently
when
i
am
reflecting
on
those
occasions
even
deaf
persons
can
hear
me
think
i
went
by
the
way
of
cincinnati
and
down
the
ohio
and
mississippi
my
idea
was
to
take
ship
at
new
orleans
for
para
in
new
orleans
i
inquired
and
found
there
was
no
ship
leaving
for
para
also
that
there
never
had
been
one
leaving
for
para
i
reflected
a
policeman
came
and
asked
me
what
i
was
doing
and
i
told
him
he
made
me
move
on
and
said
if
he
caught
me
reflecting
in
the
public
street
again
he
would
run
me
in
after
a
few
days
i
was
out
of
money
then
circumstance
arrived
with
another
turning
point
of
my
life
a
new
link
on
my
way
down
i
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
pilot
i
begged
him
to
teach
me
the
river
and
he
consented
i
became
a
pilot
by
and
by
circumstance
came
again
introducing
the
civil
war
this
time
in
order
to
push
me
ahead
another
stage
or
two
toward
the
literary
profession
the
boats
stopped
running
my
livelihood
was
gone
circumstance
came
to
the
rescue
with
a
new
turning
point
and
a
fresh
link
my
brother
was
appointed
secretary
to
the
new
territory
of
nevada
and
he
invited
me
to
go
with
him
and
help
him
in
his
office
i
accepted
in
nevada
circumstance
furnished
me
the
silver
fever
and
i
went
into
the
mines
to
make
a
fortune
as
i
supposed
but
that
was
not
the
idea
the
idea
was
to
advance
me
another
step
toward
literature
for
amusement
i
scribbled
things
for
the
virginia
city
enterprise
one
isn't
a
printer
ten
years
without
setting
up
acres
of
good
and
bad
literature
and
learning
unconsciously
at
first
consciously
later
to
discriminate
between
the
two
within
his
mental
limitations
and
meantime
he
is
unconsciously
acquiring
what
is
called
a
style
one
of
my
efforts
attracted
attention
and
the
enterprise
sent
for
me
and
put
me
on
its
staff
and
so
i
became
a
journalist
another
link
by
and
by
circumstance
and
the
sacramento
union
sent
me
to
the
sandwich
islands
for
five
or
six
months
to
write
up
sugar
i
did
it
and
threw
in
a
good
deal
of
extraneous
matter
that
hadn't
anything
to
do
with
sugar
but
it
was
this
extraneous
matter
that
helped
me
to
another
link
it
made
me
notorious
and
san
francisco
invited
me
to
lecture
which
i
did
and
profitably
i
had
long
had
a
desire
to
travel
and
see
the
world
and
now
circumstance
had
most
kindly
and
unexpectedly
hurled
me
upon
the
platform
and
furnished
me
the
means
so
i
joined
the
quaker
city
excursion
when
i
returned
to
america
circumstance
was
waiting
on
the
pier
with
the
last
link
the
conspicuous
the
consummating
the
victorious
link
i
was
asked
to
write
a
book
and
i
did
it
and
called
it
the
innocents
abroad
thus
i
became
at
last
a
member
of
the
literary
guild
that
was
forty
two
years
ago
and
i
have
been
a
member
ever
since
leaving
the
rubicon
incident
away
back
where
it
belongs
i
can
say
with
truth
that
the
reason
i
am
in
the
literary
profession
is
because
i
had
the
measles
when
i
was
twelve
years
old
iii
now
what
interests
me
as
regards
these
details
is
not
the
details
themselves
but
the
fact
that
none
of
them
was
foreseen
by
me
none
of
them
was
planned
by
me
i
was
the
author
of
none
of
them
circumstance
working
in
harness
with
my
temperament
created
them
all
and
compelled
them
all
i
often
offered
help
and
with
the
best
intentions
but
it
was
rejected
as
a
rule
uncourteously
i
could
never
plan
a
thing
and
get
it
to
come
out
the
way
i
planned
it
it
came
out
some
other
way
some
way
i
had
not
counted
upon
and
so
i
do
not
admire
the
human
being
as
an
intellectual
marvel
as
much
as
i
did
when
i
was
young
and
got
him
out
of
books
and
did
not
know
him
personally
when
i
used
to
read
that
such
and
such
a
general
did
a
certain
brilliant
thing
i
believed
it
whereas
it
was
not
so
circumstance
did
it
by
help
of
his
temperament
the
circumstance
would
have
failed
of
effect
with
a
general
of
another
temperament
he
might
see
the
chance
but
lose
the
advantage
by
being
by
nature
too
slow
or
too
quick
or
too
doubtful
once
general
grant
was
asked
a
question
about
a
matter
which
had
been
much
debated
by
the
public
and
the
newspapers
he
answered
the
question
without
any
hesitancy
general
who
planned
the
march
through
georgia
the
enemy
he
added
that
the
enemy
usually
makes
your
plans
for
you
he
meant
that
the
enemy
by
neglect
or
through
force
of
circumstances
leaves
an
opening
for
you
and
you
see
your
chance
and
take
advantage
of
it
circumstances
do
the
planning
for
us
all
no
doubt
by
help
of
our
temperaments
i
see
no
great
difference
between
a
man
and
a
watch
except
that
the
man
is
conscious
and
the
watch
isn't
and
the
man
tries
to
plan
things
and
the
watch
doesn't
the
watch
doesn't
wind
itself
and
doesn't
regulate
itself
these
things
are
done
exteriorly
outside
influences
outside
circumstances
wind
the
man
and
regulate
him
left
to
himself
he
wouldn't
get
regulated
at
all
and
the
sort
of
time
he
would
keep
would
not
be
valuable
some
rare
men
are
wonderful
watches
with
gold
case
compensation
balance
and
all
those
things
and
some
men
are
only
simple
and
sweet
and
humble
waterburys
i
am
a
waterbury
a
waterbury
of
that
kind
some
say
a
nation
is
only
an
individual
multiplied
it
makes
plans
and
circumstance
comes
and
upsets
them
or
enlarges
them
some
patriots
throw
the
tea
overboard
some
other
patriots
destroy
a
bastille
the
plans
stop
there
then
circumstance
comes
in
quite
unexpectedly
and
turns
these
modest
riots
into
a
revolution
and
there
was
poor
columbus
he
elaborated
a
deep
plan
to
find
a
new
route
to
an
old
country
circumstance
revised
his
plan
for
him
and
he
found
a
new
world
and
he
gets
the
credit
of
it
to
this
day
he
hadn't
anything
to
do
with
it
necessarily
the
scene
of
the
real
turning
point
of
my
life
and
of
yours
was
the
garden
of
eden
it
was
there
that
the
first
link
was
forged
of
the
chain
that
was
ultimately
to
lead
to
the
emptying
of
me
into
the
literary
guild
adam's
temperament
was
the
first
command
the
deity
ever
issued
to
a
human
being
on
this
planet
and
it
was
the
only
command
adam
would
never
be
able
to
disobey
it
said
be
weak
be
water
be
characterless
be
cheaply
persuadable
the
latter
command
to
let
the
fruit
alone
was
certain
to
be
disobeyed
not
by
adam
himself
but
by
his
temperament
which
he
did
not
create
and
had
no
authority
over
for
the
temperament
is
the
man
the
thing
tricked
out
with
clothes
and
named
man
is
merely
its
shadow
nothing
more
the
law
of
the
tiger's
temperament
is
thou
shalt
kill
the
law
of
the
sheep's
temperament
is
thou
shalt
not
kill
to
issue
later
commands
requiring
the
tiger
to
let
the
fat
stranger
alone
and
requiring
the
sheep
to
imbue
its
hands
in
the
blood
of
the
lion
is
not
worth
while
for
those
commands
can't
be
obeyed
they
would
invite
to
violations
of
the
law
of
temperament
which
is
supreme
and
takes
precedence
of
all
other
authorities
i
cannot
help
feeling
disappointed
in
adam
and
eve
that
is
in
their
temperaments
not
in
them
poor
helpless
young
creatures
afflicted
with
temperaments
made
out
of
butter
which
butter
was
commanded
to
get
into
contact
with
fire
and
be
melted
what
i
cannot
help
wishing
is
that
adam
and
eve
had
been
postponed
and
martin
luther
and
joan
of
arc
put
in
their
place
that
splendid
pair
equipped
with
temperaments
not
made
of
butter
but
of
asbestos
by
neither
sugary
persuasions
nor
by
hell
fire
could
satan
have
beguiled
them
to
eat
the
apple
there
would
have
been
results
indeed
yes
the
apple
would
be
intact
today
there
would
be
no
human
race
there
would
be
no
you
there
would
be
no
me
and
the
old
old
creation
dawn
scheme
of
ultimately
launching
me
into
the
literary
guild
would
have
been
defeated
how
to
make
history
dates
stick
these
chapters
are
for
children
and
i
shall
try
to
make
the
words
large
enough
to
command
respect
in
the
hope
that
you
are
listening
and
that
you
have
confidence
in
me
i
will
proceed
dates
are
difficult
things
to
acquire
and
after
they
are
acquired
it
is
difficult
to
keep
them
in
the
head
but
they
are
very
valuable
they
are
like
the
cattle
pens
of
a
ranch
they
shut
in
the
several
brands
of
historical
cattle
each
within
its
own
fence
and
keep
them
from
getting
mixed
together
dates
are
hard
to
remember
because
they
consist
of
figures
figures
are
monotonously
unstriking
in
appearance
and
they
don't
take
hold
they
form
no
pictures
and
so
they
give
the
eye
no
chance
to
help
pictures
are
the
thing
pictures
can
make
dates
stick
they
can
make
nearly
anything
stick
particularly
if
you
make
the
pictures
yourself
indeed
that
is
the
great
point
make
the
pictures
yourself
i
know
about
this
from
experience
thirty
years
ago
i
was
delivering
a
memorized
lecture
every
night
and
every
night
i
had
to
help
myself
with
a
page
of
notes
to
keep
from
getting
myself
mixed
the
notes
consisted
of
beginnings
of
sentences
and
were
eleven
in
number
and
they
ran
something
like
this
in
that
region
the
weather
at
that
time
it
was
a
custom
but
in
california
one
never
heard
eleven
of
them
they
initialed
the
brief
divisions
of
the
lecture
and
protected
me
against
skipping
but
they
all
looked
about
alike
on
the
page
they
formed
no
picture
i
had
them
by
heart
but
i
could
never
with
certainty
remember
the
order
of
their
succession
therefore
i
always
had
to
keep
those
notes
by
me
and
look
at
them
every
little
while
once
i
mislaid
them
you
will
not
be
able
to
imagine
the
terrors
of
that
evening
i
now
saw
that
i
must
invent
some
other
protection
so
i
got
ten
of
the
initial
letters
by
heart
in
their
proper
order
i
a
b
and
so
on
and
i
went
on
the
platform
the
next
night
with
these
marked
in
ink
on
my
ten
finger
nails
but
it
didn't
answer
i
kept
track
of
the
fingers
for
a
while
then
i
lost
it
and
after
that
i
was
never
quite
sure
which
finger
i
had
used
last
i
couldn't
lick
off
a
letter
after
using
it
for
while
they
would
have
made
success
certain
it
would
also
have
provoked
too
much
curiosity
there
was
curiosity
enough
without
that
to
the
audience
i
seemed
more
interested
in
my
fingernails
than
i
was
in
my
subject
one
or
two
persons
asked
me
afterward
what
was
the
matter
with
my
hands
it
was
now
that
the
idea
of
pictures
occurred
to
me
then
my
troubles
passed
away
in
two
minutes
i
made
six
pictures
with
a
pen
and
they
did
the
work
of
the
eleven
catch
sentences
and
did
it
perfectly
i
threw
the
pictures
away
as
soon
as
they
were
made
for
i
was
sure
i
could
shut
my
eyes
and
see
them
any
time
that
was
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
the
lecture
vanished
out
of
my
head
more
than
twenty
years
ago
but
i
could
rewrite
it
from
the
pictures
for
they
remain
here
are
three
of
them
fig
the
first
one
is
a
haystack
below
it
a
rattlesnake
and
it
told
me
where
to
begin
to
talk
ranch
life
in
carson
valley
the
second
one
told
me
where
to
begin
the
talk
about
a
strange
and
violent
wind
that
used
to
burst
upon
carson
city
from
the
sierra
nevadas
every
afternoon
at
two
o'clock
and
try
to
blow
the
town
away
the
third
picture
as
you
easily
perceive
is
lightning
its
duty
was
to
remind
me
when
it
was
time
to
begin
to
talk
about
san
francisco
weather
where
there
is
no
lightning
nor
thunder
either
and
it
never
failed
me
i
will
give
you
a
valuable
hint
when
a
man
is
making
a
speech
and
you
are
to
follow
him
don't
jot
down
notes
to
speak
from
jot
down
pictures
it
is
awkward
and
embarrassing
to
have
to
keep
referring
to
notes
and
besides
it
breaks
up
your
speech
and
makes
it
ragged
and
non
coherent
but
you
can
tear
up
your
pictures
as
soon
as
you
have
made
them
they
will
stay
fresh
and
strong
in
your
memory
in
the
order
and
sequence
in
which
you
scratched
them
down
and
many
will
admire
to
see
what
a
good
memory
you
are
furnished
with
when
perhaps
your
memory
is
not
any
better
than
mine
sixteen
years
ago
when
my
children
were
little
creatures
the
governess
was
trying
to
hammer
some
primer
histories
into
their
heads
part
of
this
fun
if
you
like
to
call
it
that
consisted
in
the
memorizing
of
the
accession
dates
of
the
thirty
seven
personages
who
had
ruled
over
england
from
the
conqueror
down
these
little
people
found
it
a
bitter
hard
contract
it
was
all
dates
they
all
looked
alike
and
they
wouldn't
stick
day
after
day
of
the
summer
vacation
dribbled
by
and
still
the
kings
held
the
fort
the
children
couldn't
conquer
any
six
of
them
with
my
lecture
experience
in
mind
i
was
aware
that
i
could
invent
some
way
out
of
the
trouble
with
pictures
but
i
hoped
a
way
could
be
found
which
would
let
them
romp
in
the
open
air
while
they
learned
the
kings
i
found
it
and
then
they
mastered
all
the
monarchs
in
a
day
or
two
the
idea
was
to
make
them
see
the
reigns
with
their
eyes
that
would
be
a
large
help
we
were
at
the
farm
then
from
the
house
porch
the
grounds
sloped
gradually
down
to
the
lower
fence
and
rose
on
the
right
to
the
high
ground
where
my
small
work
den
stood
a
carriage
road
wound
through
the
grounds
and
up
the
hill
i
staked
it
out
with
the
english
monarchs
beginning
with
the
conqueror
and
you
could
stand
on
the
porch
and
clearly
see
every
reign
and
its
length
from
the
conquest
down
to
victoria
then
in
the
forty
sixth
year
of
her
reign
eight
hundred
and
seventeen
years
of
english
history
under
your
eye
at
once
english
history
was
an
unusually
live
topic
in
america
just
then
the
world
had
suddenly
realized
that
while
it
was
not
noticing
the
queen
had
passed
henry
viii
passed
henry
vi
and
elizabeth
and
gaining
in
length
every
day
her
reign
had
entered
the
list
of
the
long
ones
everybody
was
interested
now
it
was
watching
a
race
would
she
pass
the
long
edward
there
was
a
possibility
of
it
would
she
pass
the
long
henry
doubtful
most
people
said
the
long
george
impossible
everybody
said
it
but
we
have
lived
to
see
her
leave
him
two
years
behind
i
measured
off
feet
of
the
roadway
a
foot
representing
a
year
and
at
the
beginning
and
end
of
each
reign
i
drove
a
three
foot
white
pine
stake
in
the
turf
by
the
roadside
and
wrote
the
name
and
dates
on
it
abreast
the
middle
of
the
porch
front
stood
a
great
granite
flower
vase
overflowing
with
a
cataract
of
bright
yellow
flowers
i
can't
think
of
their
name
the
vase
was
william
the
conqueror
we
put
his
name
on
it
and
his
accession
date
we
started
from
that
and
measured
off
twenty
one
feet
of
the
road
and
drove
william
rufus's
stake
then
thirteen
feet
and
drove
the
first
henry's
stake
then
thirty
five
feet
and
drove
stephen's
then
nineteen
feet
which
brought
us
just
past
the
summer
house
on
the
left
then
we
staked
out
thirty
five
ten
and
seventeen
for
the
second
henry
and
richard
and
john
turned
the
curve
and
entered
upon
just
what
was
needed
for
henry
iii
a
level
straight
stretch
of
fifty
six
feet
of
road
without
a
crinkle
in
it
and
it
lay
exactly
in
front
of
the
house
in
the
middle
of
the
grounds
there
couldn't
have
been
a
better
place
for
that
long
reign
you
could
stand
on
the
porch
and
see
those
two
wide
apart
stakes
almost
with
your
eyes
shut
fig
that
isn't
the
shape
of
the
road
i
have
bunched
it
up
like
that
to
save
room
the
road
had
some
great
curves
in
it
but
their
gradual
sweep
was
such
that
they
were
no
mar
to
history
no
in
our
road
one
could
tell
at
a
glance
who
was
who
by
the
size
of
the
vacancy
between
stakes
with
locality
to
help
of
course
although
i
am
away
off
here
in
a
swedish
village
and
those
stakes
did
not
stand
till
the
snow
came
i
can
see
them
today
as
plainly
as
ever
and
whenever
i
think
of
an
english
monarch
his
stakes
rise
before
me
of
their
own
accord
and
i
notice
the
large
or
small
space
which
he
takes
up
on
our
road
are
your
kings
spaced
off
in
your
mind
when
you
think
of
richard
iii
and
of
james
ii
do
the
durations
of
their
reigns
seem
about
alike
to
you
it
isn't
so
to
me
i
always
notice
that
there's
a
foot's
difference
when
you
think
of
henry
iii
do
you
see
a
great
long
stretch
of
straight
road
i
do
and
just
at
the
end
where
it
joins
on
to
edward
i
i
always
see
a
small
pear
bush
with
its
green
fruit
hanging
down
when
i
think
of
the
commonwealth
i
see
a
shady
little
group
of
these
small
saplings
which
we
called
the
oak
parlor
when
i
think
of
george
iii
i
see
him
stretching
up
the
hill
part
of
him
occupied
by
a
flight
of
stone
steps
and
i
can
locate
stephen
to
an
inch
when
he
comes
into
my
mind
for
he
just
filled
the
stretch
which
went
by
the
summer
house
victoria's
reign
reached
almost
to
my
study
door
on
the
first
little
summit
there's
sixteen
feet
to
be
added
now
i
believe
that
that
would
carry
it
to
a
big
pine
tree
that
was
shattered
by
some
lightning
one
summer
when
it
was
trying
to
hit
me
we
got
a
good
deal
of
fun
out
of
the
history
road
and
exercise
too
we
trotted
the
course
from
the
conqueror
to
the
study
the
children
calling
out
the
names
dates
and
length
of
reigns
as
we
passed
the
stakes
going
a
good
gait
along
the
long
reigns
but
slowing
down
when
we
came
upon
people
like
mary
and
edward
vi
and
the
short
stuart
and
plantagenet
to
give
time
to
get
in
the
statistics
i
offered
prizes
too
apples
i
threw
one
as
far
as
i
could
send
it
and
the
child
that
first
shouted
the
reign
it
fell
in
got
the
apple
the
children
were
encouraged
to
stop
locating
things
as
being
over
by
the
arbor
or
in
the
oak
parlor
or
up
at
the
stone
steps
and
say
instead
that
the
things
were
in
stephen
or
in
the
commonwealth
or
in
george
iii
they
got
the
habit
without
trouble
to
have
the
long
road
mapped
out
with
such
exactness
was
a
great
boon
for
me
for
i
had
the
habit
of
leaving
books
and
other
articles
lying
around
everywhere
and
had
not
previously
been
able
to
definitely
name
the
place
and
so
had
often
been
obliged
to
go
to
fetch
them
myself
to
save
time
and
failure
but
now
i
could
name
the
reign
i
left
them
in
and
send
the
children
next
i
thought
i
would
measure
off
the
french
reigns
and
peg
them
alongside
the
english
ones
so
that
we
could
always
have
contemporaneous
french
history
under
our
eyes
as
we
went
our
english
rounds
we
pegged
them
down
to
the
hundred
years
war
then
threw
the
idea
aside
i
do
not
now
remember
why
after
that
we
made
the
english
pegs
fence
in
european
and
american
history
as
well
as
english
and
that
answered
very
well
english
and
alien
poets
statesmen
artists
heroes
battles
plagues
cataclysms
revolutions
we
shoveled
them
all
into
the
english
fences
according
to
their
dates
do
you
understand
we
gave
washington's
birth
to
george
ii
s
pegs

according
to
its
date
and
regardless
of
its
nationality
if
the
road
pegging
scheme
had
not
succeeded
i
should
have
lodged
the
kings
in
the
children's
heads
by
means
of
pictures
that
is
i
should
have
tried
it
might
have
failed
for
the
pictures
could
only
be
effective
when
made
by
the
pupil
not
the
master
for
it
is
the
work
put
upon
the
drawing
that
makes
the
drawing
stay
in
the
memory
and
my
children
were
too
little
to
make
drawings
at
that
time
and
besides
they
had
no
talent
for
art
which
is
strange
for
in
other
ways
they
are
like
me
but
i
will
develop
the
picture
plan
now
hoping
that
you
will
be
able
to
use
it
it
will
come
good
for
indoors
when
the
weather
is
bad
and
one
cannot
go
outside
and
peg
a
road
let
us
imagine
that
the
kings
are
a
procession
and
that
they
have
come
out
of
the
ark
and
down
ararat
for
exercise
and
are
now
starting
back
again
up
the
zigzag
road
this
will
bring
several
of
them
into
view
at
once
and
each
zigzag
will
represent
the
length
of
a
king's
reign
and
so
on
you
will
have
plenty
of
space
for
by
my
project
you
will
use
the
parlor
wall
you
do
not
mark
on
the
wall
that
would
cause
trouble
you
only
attach
bits
of
paper
to
it
with
pins
or
thumb
tacks
these
will
leave
no
mark
take
your
pen
now
and
twenty
one
pieces
of
white
paper
each
two
inches
square
and
we
will
do
the
twenty
one
years
of
the
conqueror's
reign
on
each
square
draw
a
picture
of
a
whale
and
write
the
dates
and
term
of
service
we
choose
the
whale
for
several
reasons
its
name
and
william's
begin
with
the
same
letter
it
is
the
biggest
fish
that
swims
and
william
is
the
most
conspicuous
figure
in
english
history
in
the
way
of
a
landmark
finally
a
whale
is
about
the
easiest
thing
to
draw
by
the
time
you
have
drawn
twenty
one
wales
and
written
william
i
twenty
one
years
twenty
one
times
those
details
will
be
your
property
you
cannot
dislodge
them
from
your
memory
with
anything
but
dynamite
i
will
make
a
sample
for
you
to
copy
fig
i
have
got
his
chin
up
too
high
but
that
is
no
matter
he
is
looking
for
harold
it
may
be
that
a
whale
hasn't
that
fin
up
there
on
his
back
but
i
do
not
remember
and
so
since
there
is
a
doubt
it
is
best
to
err
on
the
safe
side
he
looks
better
anyway
than
he
would
without
it
be
very
careful
and
attentive
while
you
are
drawing
your
first
whale
from
my
sample
and
writing
the
word
and
figures
under
it
so
that
you
will
not
need
to
copy
the
sample
any
more
compare
your
copy
with
the
sample
examine
closely
if
you
find
you
have
got
everything
right
and
can
shut
your
eyes
and
see
the
picture
and
call
the
words
and
figures
then
turn
the
sample
and
copy
upside
down
and
make
the
next
copy
from
memory
and
also
the
next
and
next
and
so
on
always
drawing
and
writing
from
memory
until
you
have
finished
the
whole
twenty
one
this
will
take
you
twenty
minutes
or
thirty
and
by
that
time
you
will
find
that
you
can
make
a
whale
in
less
time
than
an
unpracticed
person
can
make
a
sardine
also
up
to
the
time
you
die
you
will
always
be
able
to
furnish
william's
dates
to
any
ignorant
person
that
inquires
after
them
you
will
now
take
thirteen
pieces
of
blue
paper
each
two
inches
square
and
do
william
ii
fig
make
him
spout
his
water
forward
instead
of
backward
also
make
him
small
and
stick
a
harpoon
in
him
and
give
him
that
sick
look
in
the
eye
otherwise
you
might
seem
to
be
continuing
the
other
william
and
that
would
be
confusing
and
a
damage
it
is
quite
right
to
make
him
small
he
was
only
about
a
no
whale
or
along
there
somewhere
there
wasn't
room
in
him
for
his
father's
great
spirit
the
barb
of
that
harpoon
ought
not
to
show
like
that
because
it
is
down
inside
the
whale
and
ought
to
be
out
of
sight
but
it
cannot
be
helped
if
the
barb
were
removed
people
would
think
some
one
had
stuck
a
whip
stock
into
the
whale
it
is
best
to
leave
the
barb
the
way
it
is
then
every
one
will
know
it
is
a
harpoon
and
attending
to
business
remember
draw
from
the
copy
only
once
make
your
other
twelve
and
the
inscription
from
memory
now
the
truth
is
that
whenever
you
have
copied
a
picture
and
its
inscription
once
from
my
sample
and
two
or
three
times
from
memory
the
details
will
stay
with
you
and
be
hard
to
forget
after
that
if
you
like
you
may
make
merely
the
whale's
head
and
water
spout
for
the
conqueror
till
you
end
his
reign
each
time
saying
the
inscription
in
place
of
writing
it
and
in
the
case
of
william
ii
make
the
harpoon
alone
and
say
over
the
inscription
each
time
you
do
it
you
see
it
will
take
nearly
twice
as
long
to
do
the
first
set
as
it
will
to
do
the
second
and
that
will
give
you
a
marked
sense
of
the
difference
in
length
of
the
two
reigns
next
do
henry
i
on
thirty
five
squares
of
red
paper
fig
that
is
a
hen
and
suggests
henry
by
furnishing
the
first
syllable
when
you
have
repeated
the
hen
and
the
inscription
until
you
are
perfectly
sure
of
them
draw
merely
the
hen's
head
the
rest
of
the
thirty
five
times
saying
over
the
inscription
each
time
thus
fig
you
begin
to
understand
now
how
this
procession
is
going
to
look
when
it
is
on
the
wall
first
there
will
be
the
conqueror's
twenty
one
whales
and
water
spouts
the
twenty
one
white
squares
joined
to
one
another
and
making
a
white
stripe
three
and
one
half
feet
long
the
thirteen
blue
squares
of
william
ii
will
be
joined
to
that
a
blue
stripe
two
feet
two
inches
long
followed
by
henry's
red
stripe
five
feet
ten
inches
long
and
so
on
the
colored
divisions
will
smartly
show
to
the
eye
the
difference
in
the
length
of
the
reigns
and
impress
the
proportions
on
the
memory
and
the
understanding
fig
stephen
of
blois
comes
next
he
requires
nineteen
two
inch
squares
of
yellow
paper
fig
that
is
a
steer
the
sound
suggests
the
beginning
of
stephen's
name
i
choose
it
for
that
reason
i
can
make
a
better
steer
than
that
when
i
am
not
excited
but
this
one
will
do
it
is
a
good
enough
steer
for
history
the
tail
is
defective
but
it
only
wants
straightening
out
next
comes
henry
ii
give
him
thirty
five
squares
of
red
paper
these
hens
must
face
west
like
the
former
ones
fig
this
hen
differs
from
the
other
one
he
is
on
his
way
to
inquire
what
has
been
happening
in
canterbury
now
we
arrive
at
richard
i
called
richard
of
the
lion
heart
because
he
was
a
brave
fighter
and
was
never
so
contented
as
when
he
was
leading
crusades
in
palestine
and
neglecting
his
affairs
at
home
give
him
ten
squares
of
white
paper
fig
that
is
a
lion
his
office
is
to
remind
you
of
the
lion
hearted
richard
there
is
something
the
matter
with
his
legs
but
i
do
not
quite
know
what
it
is
they
do
not
seem
right
i
think
the
hind
ones
are
the
most
unsatisfactory
the
front
ones
are
well
enough
though
it
would
be
better
if
they
were
rights
and
lefts
next
comes
king
john
and
he
was
a
poor
circumstance
he
was
called
lackland
he
gave
his
realm
to
the
pope
let
him
have
seventeen
squares
of
yellow
paper
fig
that
creature
is
a
jamboree
it
looks
like
a
trademark
but
that
is
only
an
accident
and
not
intentional
it
is
prehistoric
and
extinct
it
used
to
roam
the
earth
in
the
old
silurian
times
and
lay
eggs
and
catch
fish
and
climb
trees
and
live
on
fossils
for
it
was
of
a
mixed
breed
which
was
the
fashion
then
it
was
very
fierce
and
the
old
silurians
were
afraid
of
it
but
this
is
a
tame
one
physically
it
has
no
representative
now
but
its
mind
has
been
transmitted
first
i
drew
it
sitting
down
but
have
turned
it
the
other
way
now
because
i
think
it
looks
more
attractive
and
spirited
when
one
end
of
it
is
galloping
i
love
to
think
that
in
this
attitude
it
gives
us
a
pleasant
idea
of
john
coming
all
in
a
happy
excitement
to
see
what
the
barons
have
been
arranging
for
him
at
runnymede
while
the
other
one
gives
us
an
idea
of
him
sitting
down
to
wring
his
hands
and
grieve
over
it
we
now
come
to
henry
iii
red
squares
again
of
course
fifty
six
of
them
we
must
make
all
the
henrys
the
same
color
it
will
make
their
long
reigns
show
up
handsomely
on
the
wall
among
all
the
eight
henrys
there
were
but
two
short
ones
a
lucky
name
as
far
as
longevity
goes
the
reigns
of
six
of
the
henrys
cover
years
it
might
have
been
well
to
name
all
the
royal
princes
henry
but
this
was
overlooked
until
it
was
too
late
fig
this
is
the
best
one
yet
he
is
on
his
way
to
have
a
look
at
the
first
house
of
commons
in
english
history
it
was
a
monumental
event
the
situation
of
the
house
and
was
the
second
great
liberty
landmark
which
the
century
had
set
up
i
have
made
henry
looking
glad
but
this
was
not
intentional
edward
i
comes
next
light
brown
paper
thirty
five
squares
fig
that
is
an
editor
he
is
trying
to
think
of
a
word
he
props
his
feet
on
the
chair
which
is
the
editor's
way
then
he
can
think
better
i
do
not
care
much
for
this
one
his
ears
are
not
alike
still
editor
suggests
the
sound
of
edward
and
he
will
do
i
could
make
him
better
if
i
had
a
model
but
i
made
this
one
from
memory
but
it
is
no
particular
matter
they
all
look
alike
anyway
they
are
conceited
and
troublesome
and
don't
pay
enough
edward
was
the
first
really
english
king
that
had
yet
occupied
the
throne
the
editor
in
the
picture
probably
looks
just
as
edward
looked
when
it
was
first
borne
in
upon
him
that
this
was
so
his
whole
attitude
expressed
gratification
and
pride
mixed
with
stupefaction
and
astonishment
edward
ii
now
twenty
blue
squares
fig
another
editor
that
thing
behind
his
ear
is
his
pencil
whenever
he
finds
a
bright
thing
in
your
manuscript
he
strikes
it
out
with
that
that
does
him
good
and
makes
him
smile
and
show
his
teeth
the
way
he
is
doing
in
the
picture
this
one
has
just
been
striking
out
a
smart
thing
and
now
he
is
sitting
there
with
his
thumbs
in
his
vest
holes
gloating
they
are
full
of
envy
and
malice
editors
are
this
picture
will
serve
to
remind
you
that
edward
ii
was
the
first
english
king
who
was
deposed
upon
demand
he
signed
his
deposition
himself
he
had
found
kingship
a
most
aggravating
and
disagreeable
occupation
and
you
can
see
by
the
look
of
him
that
he
is
glad
he
resigned
he
has
put
his
blue
pencil
up
for
good
now
he
had
struck
out
many
a
good
thing
with
it
in
his
time
edward
iii
next
fifty
red
squares
fig
this
editor
is
a
critic
he
has
pulled
out
his
carving
knife
and
his
tomahawk
and
is
starting
after
a
book
which
he
is
going
to
have
for
breakfast
this
one's
arms
are
put
on
wrong
i
did
not
notice
it
at
first
but
i
see
it
now
somehow
he
has
got
his
right
arm
on
his
left
shoulder
and
his
left
arm
on
the
right
shoulder
and
this
shows
us
the
back
of
his
hands
in
both
instances
it
makes
him
left
handed
all
around
which
is
a
thing
which
has
never
happened
before
except
perhaps
in
a
museum
that
is
the
way
with
art
when
it
is
not
acquired
but
born
to
you
you
start
in
to
make
some
simple
little
thing
not
suspecting
that
your
genius
is
beginning
to
work
and
swell
and
strain
in
secret
and
all
of
a
sudden
there
is
a
convulsion
and
you
fetch
out
something
astonishing
this
is
called
inspiration
it
is
an
accident
you
never
know
when
it
is
coming
i
might
have
tried
as
much
as
a
year
to
think
of
such
a
strange
thing
as
an
all
around
left
handed
man
and
i
could
not
have
done
it
for
the
more
you
try
to
think
of
an
unthinkable
thing
the
more
it
eludes
you
but
it
can't
elude
inspiration
you
have
only
to
bait
with
inspiration
and
you
will
get
it
every
time
look
at
botticelli's
spring
those
snaky
women
were
unthinkable
but
inspiration
secured
them
for
us
thanks
to
goodness
it
is
too
late
to
reorganize
this
editor
critic
now
we
will
leave
him
as
he
is
he
will
serve
to
remind
us
richard
ii
next
twenty
two
white
squares
fig
we
use
the
lion
again
because
this
is
another
richard
like
edward
ii
he
was
deposed
he
is
taking
a
last
sad
look
at
his
crown
before
they
take
it
away
there
was
not
room
enough
and
i
have
made
it
too
small
but
it
never
fitted
him
anyway
now
we
turn
the
corner
of
the
century
with
a
new
line
of
monarchs
the
lancastrian
kings
henry
iv
fourteen
squares
of
yellow
paper
fig
this
hen
has
laid
the
egg
of
a
new
dynasty
and
realizes
the
imposing
magnitude
of
the
event
she
is
giving
notice
in
the
usual
way
you
notice
i
am
improving
in
the
construction
of
hens
at
first
i
made
them
too
much
like
other
animals
but
this
one
is
orthodox
i
mention
this
to
encourage
you
you
will
find
that
the
more
you
practice
the
more
accurate
you
will
become
i
could
always
draw
animals
but
before
i
was
educated
i
could
not
tell
what
kind
they
were
when
i
got
them
done
but
now
i
can
keep
up
your
courage
it
will
be
the
same
with
you
although
you
may
not
think
it
this
henry
died
the
year
after
joan
of
arc
was
born
henry
v
nine
blue
squares
fig
there
you
see
him
lost
in
meditation
over
the
monument
which
records
the
amazing
figures
of
the
battle
of
agincourt
french
history
says
englishmen
routed
frenchmen
there
and
english
historians
say
that
the
french
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
was
henry
vi
thirty
nine
red
squares
fig
this
is
poor
henry
vi
who
reigned
long
and
scored
many
misfortunes
and
humiliations
also
two
great
disasters
he
lost
france
to
joan
of
arc
and
he
lost
the
throne
and
ended
the
dynasty
which
henry
iv
had
started
in
business
with
such
good
prospects
in
the
picture
we
see
him
sad
and
weary
and
downcast
with
the
scepter
falling
from
his
nerveless
grasp
it
is
a
pathetic
quenching
of
a
sun
which
had
risen
in
such
splendor
edward
iv
twenty
two
light
brown
squares
fig
that
is
a
society
editor
sitting
there
elegantly
dressed
with
his
legs
crossed
in
that
indolent
way
observing
the
clothes
the
ladies
wear
so
that
he
can
describe
them
for
his
paper

they
are

bribes
for
it

wealthy
that
flower
which
he
is
wearing
in
his
buttonhole
is
a
rose
a
white
rose
a
york
rose
and
will
serve
to
remind
us
of
the
war
of
the
roses
and
that
the
white
one
was
the
winning
color
when
edward
got
the
throne

dispossessed

black
square
fig
his
uncle
richard
had
him
murdered
in
the
tower
when
you
get
the
reigns
displayed
upon
the
wall
this
one
will
be
conspicuous
and
easily
remembered
it
is
the
shortest
one
in
english
history
except
lady
jane
grey's
which
was
only
nine
days
she
is
never
officially
recognized
as
a
monarch
of
england
but
if
you
or
i
should
ever
occupy
a
throne
we
should
like
to
have
proper
notice
taken
of
it
and
it
would
be
only
fair
and
right
too
particularly
if
we
gained
nothing
by
it
and
lost
our
lives

good
king
you
would
think
that
this
lion
has
two
heads
but
that
is
not
so
one
is
only
a
shadow
there
would
be
shadows
for
the
rest
of
him
but
there
was
not
light
enough
to
go
round
it
being
a
dull
day
with
only
fleeting
sun
glimpses
now
and
then
richard
had
a
humped
back
and
a
hard
heart
and
fell
at
the
battle
of
bosworth
i
do
not
know
the
name
of
that
flower
in
the
pot
but
we
will
use
it
as
richard's
trade
mark
for
it
is
said
that
it
grows
in
only
one
place
in
the
world
bosworth

tradition
says
it
never
grew
there
until
richard's
royal

warmed
its
hidden
seed

brings
us
to
the
reign
of
elizabeth
after
passing
through
a
period
of
nearly
five
hundred
years
of
england's
history
to
be
exact
i
think
you
may
now
be
trusted
to
go
the
rest
of
the
way
without
further
lessons
in
art
or
inspirations
in
the
matter
of
ideas
you
have
the
scheme
now
and
something
in
the
ruler's
name
or
career
will
suggest
the
pictorial
symbol
the
effort
of
inventing
such
things
will
not
only
help
your
memory
but
will
develop
originality
in
art
see
what
it
has
done
for
me
if
you
do
not
find
the
parlor
wall
big
enough
for
all
of
england's
history
continue
it
into
the
dining
room
and
into
other
rooms
this
will
make
the
walls
interesting
and
instructive
and
really
worth
something
instead
of
being
just
flat
things
to
hold
the
house
together
summer
of
the
memorable
assassination
note
the
assassination
of
the
empress
of
austria
at
geneva
september
occurred
during
mark
twain's
austrian
residence
the
news
came
to
him
at
kaltenleutgeben
a
summer
resort
a
little
way
out
of
vienna
to
his
friend
the
rev
jos
h
twichell
he
wrote
that
good
and
unoffending
lady
the
empress
is
killed
by
a
madman
and
i
am
living
in
the
midst
of
world
history
again
the
queen's
jubilee
last
year
the
invasion
of
the
reichsrath
by
the
police
and
now
this
murder
which
will
still
be
talked
of
and
described
and
painted
a
thousand
years
from
now
to
have
a
personal
friend
of
the
wearer
of
two
crowns
burst
in
at
the
gate
in
the
deep
dusk
of
the
evening
and
say
in
a
voice
broken
with
tears
my
god
the
empress
is
murdered
and
fly
toward
her
home
before
we
can
utter
a
question
why
it
brings
the
giant
event
home
to
you
makes
you
a
part
of
it
and
personally
interested
it
is
as
if
your
neighbor
antony
should
come
flying
and
say
caesar
is
butchered
the
head
of
the
world
is
fallen
of
course
there
is
no
talk
but
of
this
the
mourning
is
universal
and
genuine
the
consternation
is
stupefying
the
austrian
empire
is
being
draped
with
black
vienna
will
be
a
spectacle
to
see
by
next
saturday
when
the
funeral
cortege
marches
he
was
strongly
moved
by
the
tragedy
impelled
to
write
concerning
it
he
prepared
the
article
which
here
follows
but
did
not
offer
it
for
publication
perhaps
feeling
that
his
own
close
association
with
the
court
circles
at
the
moment
prohibited
this
personal
utterance
there
appears
no
such
reason
for
withholding
its
publication
now
a
b
p
the
more
one
thinks
of
the
assassination
the
more
imposing
and
tremendous
the
event
becomes
the
destruction
of
a
city
is
a
large
event
but
it
is
one
which
repeats
itself
several
times
in
a
thousand
years
the
destruction
of
a
third
part
of
a
nation
by
plague
and
famine
is
a
large
event
but
it
has
happened
several
times
in
history
the
murder
of
a
king
is
a
large
event
but
it
has
been
frequent
the
murder
of
an
empress
is
the
largest
of
all
large
events
one
must
go
back
about
two
thousand
years
to
find
an
instance
to
put
with
this
one
the
oldest
family
of
unchallenged
descent
in
christendom
lives
in
rome
and
traces
its
line
back
seventeen
hundred
years
but
no
member
of
it
has
been
present
in
the
earth
when
an
empress
was
murdered
until
now
many
a
time
during
these
seventeen
centuries
members
of
that
family
have
been
startled
with
the
news
of
extraordinary
events
the
destruction
of
cities
the
fall
of
thrones
the
murder
of
kings
the
wreck
of
dynasties
the
extinction
of
religions
the
birth
of
new
systems
of
government
and
their
descendants
have
been
by
to
hear
of
it
and
talk
about
it
when
all
these
things
were
repeated
once
twice
or
a
dozen
times
but
to
even
that
family
has
come
news
at
last
which
is
not
staled
by
use
has
no
duplicates
in
the
long
reach
of
its
memory
it
is
an
event
which
confers
a
curious
distinction
upon
every
individual
now
living
in
the
world
he
has
stood
alive
and
breathing
in
the
presence
of
an
event
such
as
has
not
fallen
within
the
experience
of
any
traceable
or
untraceable
ancestor
of
his
for
twenty
centuries
and
it
is
not
likely
to
fall
within
the
experience
of
any
descendant
of
his
for
twenty
more
time
has
made
some
great
changes
since
the
roman
days
the
murder
of
an
empress
then
even
the
assassination
of
caesar
himself
could
not
electrify
the
world
as
this
murder
has
electrified
it
for
one
reason
there
was
then
not
much
of
a
world
to
electrify
it
was
a
small
world
as
to
known
bulk
and
it
had
rather
a
thin
population
besides
and
for
another
reason
the
news
traveled
so
slowly
that
its
tremendous
initial
thrill
wasted
away
week
by
week
and
month
by
month
on
the
journey
and
by
the
time
it
reached
the
remoter
regions
there
was
but
little
of
it
left
it
was
no
longer
a
fresh
event
it
was
a
thing
of
the
far
past
it
was
not
properly
news
it
was
history
but
the
world
is
enormous
now
and
prodigiously
populated
that
is
one
change
and
another
is
the
lightning
swiftness
of
the
flight
of
tidings
good
and
bad
the
empress
is
murdered
when
those
amazing
words
struck
upon
my
ear
in
this
austrian
village
last
saturday
three
hours
after
the
disaster
i
knew
that
it
was
already
old
news
in
london
paris
berlin
new
york
san
francisco
japan
china
melbourne
cape
town
bombay
madras
calcutta
and
that
the
entire
globe
with
a
single
voice
was
cursing
the
perpetrator
of
it
since
the
telegraph
first
began
to
stretch
itself
wider
and
wider
about
the
earth
larger
and
increasingly
larger
areas
of
the
world
have
as
time
went
on
received
simultaneously
the
shock
of
a
great
calamity
but
this
is
the
first
time
in
history
that
the
entire
surface
of
the
globe
has
been
swept
in
a
single
instant
with
the
thrill
of
so
gigantic
an
event
and
who
is
the
miracle
worker
who
has
furnished
to
the
world
this
spectacle
all
the
ironies
are
compacted
in
the
answer
he
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
human
ladder
as
the
accepted
estimates
of
degree
and
value
go
a
soiled
and
patched
young
loafer
without
gifts
without
talents
without
education
without
morals
without
character
without
any
born
charm
or
any
acquired
one
that
wins
or
beguiles
or
attracts
without
a
single
grace
of
mind
or
heart
or
hand
that
any
tramp
or
prostitute
could
envy
him
an
unfaithful
private
in
the
ranks
an
incompetent
stone
cutter
an
inefficient
lackey
in
a
word
a
mangy
offensive
empty
unwashed
vulgar
gross
mephitic
timid
sneaking
human
polecat
and
it
was
within
the
privileges
and
powers
of
this
sarcasm
upon
the
human
race
to
reach
up
up
up
and
strike
from
its
far
summit
in
the
social
skies
the
world's
accepted
ideal
of
glory
and
might
and
splendor
and
sacredness
it
realizes
to
us
what
sorry
shows
and
shadows
we
are
without
our
clothes
and
our
pedestals
we
are
poor
things
and
much
of
a
size
our
dignities
are
not
real
our
pomps
are
shams
at
our
best
and
stateliest
we
are
not
suns
as
we
pretended
and
teach
and
believe
but
only
candles
and
any
bummer
can
blow
us
out
and
now
we
get
realized
to
us
once
more
another
thing
which
we
often
forget
or
try
to
that
no
man
has
a
wholly
undiseased
mind
that
in
one
way
or
another
all
men
are
mad
many
are
mad
for
money
when
this
madness
is
in
a
mild
form
it
is
harmless
and
the
man
passes
for
sane
but
when
it
develops
powerfully
and
takes
possession
of
the
man
it
can
make
him
cheat
rob
and
kill
and
when
he
has
got
his
fortune
and
lost
it
again
it
can
land
him
in
the
asylum
or
the
suicide's
coffin
love
is
a
madness
if
thwarted
it
develops
fast
it
can
grow
to
a
frenzy
of
despair
and
make
an
otherwise
sane
and
highly
gifted
prince
like
rudolph
throw
away
the
crown
of
an
empire
and
snuff
out
his
own
life
all
the
whole
list
of
desires
predilections
aversions
ambitions
passions
cares
griefs
regrets
remorses
are
incipient
madness
and
ready
to
grow
spread
and
consume
when
the
occasion
comes
there
are
no
healthy
minds
and
nothing
saves
any
man
but
accident
the
accident
of
not
having
his
malady
put
to
the
supreme
test
one
of
the
commonest
forms
of
madness
is
the
desire
to
be
noticed
the
pleasure
derived
from
being
noticed
perhaps
it
is
not
merely
common
but
universal
in
its
mildest
form
it
doubtless
is
universal
every
child
is
pleased
at
being
noticed
many
intolerable
children
put
in
their
whole
time
in
distressing
and
idiotic
effort
to
attract
the
attention
of
visitors
boys
are
always
showing
off
apparently
all
men
and
women
are
glad
and
grateful
when
they
find
that
they
have
done
a
thing
which
has
lifted
them
for
a
moment
out
of
obscurity
and
caused
wondering
talk
this
common
madness
can
develop
by
nurture
into
a
hunger
for
notoriety
in
one
for
fame
in
another
it
is
this
madness
for
being
noticed
and
talked
about
which
has
invented
kingship
and
the
thousand
other
dignities
and
tricked
them
out
with
pretty
and
showy
fineries
it
has
made
kings
pick
one
another's
pockets
scramble
for
one
another's
crowns
and
estates
slaughter
one
another's
subjects
it
has
raised
up
prize
fighters
and
poets
and
village
mayors
and
little
and
big
politicians
and
big
and
little
charity
founders
and
bicycle
champions
and
banditti
chiefs
and
frontier
desperadoes
and
napoleons
anything
to
get
notoriety
anything
to
set
the
village
or
the
township
or
the
city
or
the
state
or
the
nation
or
the
planet
shouting
look
there
he
goes
that
is
the
man
and
in
five
minutes
time
at
no
cost
of
brain
or
labor
or
genius
this
mangy
italian
tramp
has
beaten
them
all
transcended
them
all
outstripped
them
all
for
in
time
their
names
will
perish
but
by
the
friendly
help
of
the
insane
newspapers
and
courts
and
kings
and
historians
his
is
safe
to
live
and
thunder
in
the
world
all
down
the
ages
as
long
as
human
speech
shall
endure
oh
if
it
were
not
so
tragic
how
ludicrous
it
would
be
she
was
so
blameless
the
empress
and
so
beautiful
in
mind
and
heart
in
person
and
spirit
and
whether
with
a
crown
upon
her
head
or
without
it
and
nameless
a
grace
to
the
human
race
and
almost
a
justification
of
its
creation
would
be
indeed
but
that
the
animal
that
struck
her
down
re
establishes
the
doubt
in
her
character
was
every
quality
that
in
woman
invites
and
engages
respect
esteem
affection
and
homage
her
tastes
her
instincts
and
her
aspirations
were
all
high
and
fine
and
all
her
life
her
heart
and
brain
were
busy
with
activities
of
a
noble
sort
she
had
had
bitter
griefs
but
they
did
not
sour
her
spirit
and
she
had
had
the
highest
honors
in
the
world's
gift
but
she
went
her
simple
way
unspoiled
she
knew
all
ranks
and
won
them
all
and
made
them
her
friends
an
english
fisherman's
wife

when
a
body
was
in
trouble
she
didn't
send
her
help
she
brought
it
herself
crowns
have
adorned
others
but
she
adorned
her
crowns
it
was
a
swift
celebrity
the
assassin
achieved
and
it
is
marked
by
some
curious
contrasts
at
noon
last
saturday
there
was
no
one
in
the
world
who
would
have
considered
acquaintanceship
with
him
a
thing
worth
claiming
or
mentioning
no
one
would
have
been
vain
of
such
an
acquaintanceship
the
humblest
honest
boot
black
would
not
have
valued
the
fact
that
he
had
met
him
or
seen
him
at
some
time
or
other
he
was
sunk
in
abysmal
obscurity
he
was
away
beneath
the
notice
of
the
bottom
grades
of
officialdom
three
hours
later
he
was
the
one
subject
of
conversation
in
the
world
the
gilded
generals
and
admirals
and
governors
were
discussing
him
all
the
kings
and
queens
and
emperors
had
put
aside
their
other
interests
to
talk
about
him
and
wherever
there
was
a
man
at
the
summit
of
the
world
or
the
bottom
of
it
who
by
chance
had
at
some
time
or
other
come
across
that
creature
he
remembered
it
with
a
secret
satisfaction
and
mentioned
it
for
it
was
a
distinction
now
it
brings
human
dignity
pretty
low
and
for
a
moment
the
thing
is
not
quite
realizable
but
it
is
perfectly
true
if
there
is
a
king
who
can
remember
now
that
he
once
saw
that
creature
in
a
time
past
he
has
let
that
fact
out
in
a
more
or
less
studiedly
casual
and
indifferent
way
some
dozens
of
times
during
the
past
week
for
a
king
is
merely
human
the
inside
of
him
is
exactly
like
the
inside
of
any
other
person
and
it
is
human
to
find
satisfaction
in
being
in
a
kind
of
personal
way
connected
with
amazing
events
we
are
all
privately
vain
of
such
a
thing
we
are
all
alike
a
king
is
a
king
by
accident
the
reason
the
rest
of
us
are
not
kings
is
merely
due
to
another
accident
we
are
all
made
out
of
the
same
clay
and
it
is
a
sufficiently
poor
quality
below
the
kings
these
remarks
are
in
the
air
these
days
i
know
it
as
well
as
if
i
were
hearing
them
the
commander
he
was
in
my
army
the
general
he
was
in
my
corps
the
colonel
he
was
in
my
regiment
a
brute
i
remember
him
well
the
captain
he
was
in
my
company
a
troublesome
scoundrel
i
remember
him
well
the
sergeant
did
i
know
him
as
well
as
i
know
you
why
every
morning
i
used
to
etc
etc
a
glad
long
story
told
to
devouring
ears
the
landlady
many's
the
time
he
boarded
with
me
i
can
show
you
his
very
room
and
the
very
bed
he
slept
in
and
the
charcoal
mark
there
on
the
wall
he
made
that
my
little
johnny
saw
him
do
it
with
his
own
eyes
didn't
you
johnny
it
is
easy
to
see
by
the
papers
that
the
magistrate
and
the
constables
and
the
jailer
treasure
up
the
assassin's
daily
remarks
and
doings
as
precious
things
and
as
wallowing
this
week
in
seas
of
blissful
distinction
the
interviewer
too
he
tries
to
let
on
that
he
is
not
vain
of
his
privilege
of
contact
with
this
man
whom
few
others
are
allowed
to
gaze
upon
but
he
is
human
like
the
rest
and
can
no
more
keep
his
vanity
corked
in
than
could
you
or
i
some
think
that
this
murder
is
a
frenzied
revolt
against
the
criminal
militarism
which
is
impoverishing
europe
and
driving
the
starving
poor
mad
that
has
many
crimes
to
answer
for
but
not
this
one
i
think
one
may
not
attribute
to
this
man
a
generous
indignation
against
the
wrongs
done
the
poor
one
may
not
dignify
him
with
a
generous
impulse
of
any
kind
when
he
saw
his
photograph
and
said
i
shall
be
celebrated
he
laid
bare
the
impulse
that
prompted
him
it
was
a
mere
hunger
for
notoriety
there
is
another
confessed
case
of
the
kind
which
is
as
old
as
history
the
burning
of
the
temple
of
ephesus
among
the
inadequate
attempts
to
account
for
the
assassination
we
must
concede
high
rank
to
the
many
which
have
described
it
as
a
peculiarly
brutal
crime
and
then
added
that
it
was
ordained
from
above
i
think
this
verdict
will
not
be
popular
above
if
the
deed
was
ordained
from
above
there
is
no
rational
way
of
making
this
prisoner
even
partially
responsible
for
it
and
the
genevan
court
cannot
condemn
him
without
manifestly
committing
a
crime
logic
is
logic
and
by
disregarding
its
laws
even
the
most
pious
and
showy
theologian
may
be
beguiled
into
preferring
charges
which
should
not
be
ventured
upon
except
in
the
shelter
of
plenty
of
lightning
rods
i
witnessed
the
funeral
procession
in
company
with
friends
from
the
windows
of
the
krantz
vienna's
sumptuous
new
hotel
we
came
into
town
in
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
and
i
went
on
foot
from
the
station
black
flags
hung
down
from
all
the
houses
the
aspects
were
sunday
like
the
crowds
on
the
sidewalks
were
quiet
and
moved
slowly
very
few
people
were
smoking
many
ladies
wore
deep
mourning
gentlemen
were
in
black
as
a
rule
carriages
were
speeding
in
all
directions
with
footmen
and
coachmen
in
black
clothes
and
wearing
black
cocked
hats
the
shops
were
closed
in
many
windows
were
pictures
of
the
empress
as
a
beautiful
young
bride
of
seventeen
as
a
serene
and
majestic
lady
with
added
years
and
finally
in
deep
black
and
without
ornaments
the
costume
she
always
wore
after
the
tragic
death
of
her
son
nine
years
ago
for
her
heart
broke
then
and
life
lost
almost
all
its
value
for
her
the
people
stood
grouped
before
these
pictures
and
now
and
then
one
saw
women
and
girls
turn
away
wiping
the
tears
from
their
eyes
in
front
of
the
krantz
is
an
open
square
over
the
way
was
the
church
where
the
funeral
services
would
be
held
it
is
small
and
old
and
severely
plain
plastered
outside
and
whitewashed
or
painted
and
with
no
ornament
but
a
statue
of
a
monk
in
a
niche
over
the
door
and
above
that
a
small
black
flag
but
in
its
crypt
lie
several
of
the
great
dead
of
the
house
of
habsburg
among
them
maria
theresa
and
napoleon's
son
the
duke
of
reichstadt
hereabouts
was
a
roman
camp
once
and
in
it
the
emperor
marcus
aurelius
died
a
thousand
years
before
the
first
habsburg
ruled
in
vienna
which
was
six
hundred
years
ago
and
more
the
little
church
is
packed
in
among
great
modern
stores
and
houses
and
the
windows
of
them
were
full
of
people
behind
the
vast
plate
glass
windows
of
the
upper
floors
of
a
house
on
the
corner
one
glimpsed
terraced
masses
of
fine
clothed
men
and
women
dim
and
shimmery
like
people
under
water
under
us
the
square
was
noiseless
but
it
was
full
of
citizens
officials
in
fine
uniforms
were
flitting
about
on
errands
and
in
a
doorstep
sat
a
figure
in
the
uttermost
raggedness
of
poverty
the
feet
bare
the
head
bent
humbly
down
a
youth
of
eighteen
or
twenty
he
was
and
through
the
field
glass
one
could
see
that
he
was
tearing
apart
and
munching
riffraff
that
he
had
gathered
somewhere
blazing
uniforms
flashed
by
him
making
a
sparkling
contrast
with
his
drooping
ruin
of
moldy
rags
but
he
took
no
notice
he
was
not
there
to
grieve
for
a
nation's
disaster
he
had
his
own
cares
and
deeper
from
two
directions
two
long
files
of
infantry
came
plowing
through
the
pack
and
press
in
silence
there
was
a
low
crisp
order
and
the
crowd
vanished
the
square
save
the
sidewalks
was
empty
the
private
mourner
was
gone
another
order
the
soldiers
fell
apart
and
enclosed
the
square
in
a
double
ranked
human
fence
it
was
all
so
swift
noiseless
exact
like
a
beautifully
ordered
machine
it
was
noon
now
two
hours
of
stillness
and
waiting
followed
then
carriages
began
to
flow
past
and
deliver
the
two
or
three
hundred
court
personages
and
high
nobilities
privileged
to
enter
the
church
then
the
square
filled
up
not
with
civilians
but
with
army
and
navy
officers
in
showy
and
beautiful
uniforms
they
filled
it
compactly
leaving
only
a
narrow
carriage
path
in
front
of
the
church
but
there
was
no
civilian
among
them
and
it
was
better
so
dull
clothes
would
have
marred
the
radiant
spectacle
in
the
jam
in
front
of
the
church
on
its
steps
and
on
the
sidewalk
was
a
bunch
of
uniforms
which
made
a
blazing
splotch
of
color
intense
red
gold
and
white
which
dimmed
the
brilliancies
around
them
and
opposite
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
path
was
a
bunch
of
cascaded
bright
green
plumes
above
pale
blue
shoulders
which
made
another
splotch
of
splendor
emphatic
and
conspicuous
in
its
glowing
surroundings
it
was
a
sea
of
flashing
color
all
about
but
these
two
groups
were
the
high
notes
the
green
plumes
were
worn
by
forty
or
fifty
austrian
generals
the
group
opposite
them
were
chiefly
knights
of
malta
and
knights
of
a
german
order
the
mass
of
heads
in
the
square
were
covered
by
gilt
helmets
and
by
military
caps
roofed
with
a
mirror
like
glaze
and
the
movements
of
the
wearers
caused
these
things
to
catch
the
sun
rays
and
the
effect
was
fine
to
see
the
square
was
like
a
garden
of
richly
colored
flowers
with
a
multitude
of
blinding
and
flashing
little
suns
distributed
over
it
think
of
it
it
was
by
command
of
that
italian
loafer
yonder
on
his
imperial
throne
in
the
geneva
prison
that
this
splendid
multitude
was
assembled
there
and
the
kings
and
emperors
that
were
entering
the
church
from
a
side
street
were
there
by
his
will
it
is
so
strange
so
unrealizable
at
three
o'clock
the
carriages
were
still
streaming
by
in
single
file
at
three
five
a
cardinal
arrives
with
his
attendants
later
some
bishops
then
a
number
of
archdeacons
all
in
striking
colors
that
add
to
the
show
at
three
ten
a
procession
of
priests
passes
along
with
crucifix
another
one
presently
after
an
interval
two
more
at
three
fifty
another
one
very
long
with
many
crosses
gold
embroidered
robes
and
much
white
lace
also
great
pictured
banners
at
intervals
receding
into
the
distance
a
hum
of
tolling
bells
makes
itself
heard
but
not
sharply
at
three
fifty
eight
a
waiting
interval
presently
a
long
procession
of
gentlemen
in
evening
dress
comes
in
sight
and
approaches
until
it
is
near
to
the
square
then
falls
back
against
the
wall
of
soldiers
at
the
sidewalk
and
the
white
shirt
fronts
show
like
snowflakes
and
are
very
conspicuous
where
so
much
warm
color
is
all
about
a
waiting
pause
at
four
twelve
the
head
of
the
funeral
procession
comes
into
view
at
last
first
a
body
of
cavalry
four
abreast
to
widen
the
path
next
a
great
body
of
lancers
in
blue
with
gilt
helmets
next
three
six
horse
mourning
coaches
outriders
and
coachmen
in
black
with
cocked
hats
and
white
wigs
next
troops
in
splendid
uniforms
red
gold
and
white
exceedingly
showy
now
the
multitude
uncover
the
soldiers
present
arms
there
is
a
low
rumble
of
drums
the
sumptuous
great
hearse
approaches
drawn
at
a
walk
by
eight
black
horses
plumed
with
black
bunches
of
nodding
ostrich
feathers
the
coffin
is
borne
into
the
church
the
doors
are
closed
the
multitude
cover
their
heads
and
the
rest
of
the
procession
moves
by
first
the
hungarian
guard
in
their
indescribably
brilliant
and
picturesque
and
beautiful
uniform
inherited
from
the
ages
of
barbaric
splendor
and
after
them
other
mounted
forces
a
long
and
showy
array
then
the
shining
crown
in
the
square
crumbled
apart
a
wrecked
rainbow
and
melted
away
in
radiant
streams
and
in
the
turn
of
a
wrist
the
three
dirtiest
and
raggedest
and
cheerfulest
little
slum
girls
in
austria
were
capering
about
in
the
spacious
vacancy
it
was
a
day
of
contrasts
twice
the
empress
entered
vienna
in
state
the
first
time
was
in
when
she
was
a
bride
of
seventeen
and
then
she
rode
in
measureless
pomp
and
with
blare
of
music
through
a
fluttering
world
of
gay
flags
and
decorations
down
streets
walled
on
both
hands
with
a
press
of
shouting
and
welcoming
subjects
and
the
second
time
was
last
wednesday
when
she
entered
the
city
in
her
coffin
and
moved
down
the
same
streets
in
the
dead
of
the
night
under
swaying
black
flags
between
packed
human
walls
again
but
everywhere
was
a
deep
stillness
now
a
stillness
emphasized
rather
than
broken
by
the
muffled
hoofbeats
of
the
long
cavalcade
over
pavements
cushioned
with
sand
and
the
low
sobbing
of
gray
headed
women
who
had
witnessed
the
first
entry
forty
four
years
before
when
she
and
they
were
young
and
unaware
a
character
in
baron
von
berger's
recent
fairy
drama
habsburg
tells
about
that
first
coming
of
the
girlish
empress
queen
and
in
his
history
draws
a
fine
picture
i
cannot
make
a
close
translation
of
it
but
will
try
to
convey
the
spirit
of
the
verses
i
saw
the
stately
pageant
pass
in
her
high
place
i
saw
the
empress
queen
i
could
not
take
my
eyes
away
from
that
fair
vision
spirit
like
and
pure
that
rose
serene
sublime
and
figured
to
my
sense
a
noble
alp
far
lighted
in
the
blue
that
in
the
flood
of
morning
rends
its
veil
of
cloud
and
stands
a
dream
of
glory
to
the
gaze
of
them
that
in
the
valley
toil
and
plod
a
scrap
of
curious
history
marion
city
on
the
mississippi
river
in
the
state
of
missouri
a
village
time
la
bourboule
les
bains
france
a
village
time
the
end
of
june
i
was
in
the
one
village
in
that
early
time
i
am
in
the
other
now
these
times
and
places
are
sufficiently
wide
apart
yet
today
i
have
the
strange
sense
of
being
thrust
back
into
that
missourian
village
and
of
reliving
certain
stirring
days
that
i
lived
there
so
long
ago
last
saturday
night
the
life
of
the
president
of
the
french
republic
was
taken
by
an
italian
assassin
last
night
a
mob
surrounded
our
hotel
shouting
howling
singing
the
marseillaise
and
pelting
our
windows
with
sticks
and
stones
for
we
have
italian
waiters
and
the
mob
demanded
that
they
be
turned
out
of
the
house
instantly
to
be
drubbed
and
then
driven
out
of
the
village
everybody
in
the
hotel
remained
up
until
far
into
the
night
and
experienced
the
several
kinds
of
terror
which
one
reads
about
in
books
which
tell
of
night
attacks
by
italians
and
by
french
mobs
the
growing
roar
of
the
oncoming
crowd
the
arrival
with
rain
of
stones
and
a
crash
of
glass
the
withdrawal
to
rearrange
plans
followed
by
a
silence
ominous
threatening
and
harder
to
bear
than
even
the
active
siege
and
the
noise
the
landlord
and
the
two
village
policemen
stood
their
ground
and
at
last
the
mob
was
persuaded
to
go
away
and
leave
our
italians
in
peace
today
four
of
the
ringleaders
have
been
sentenced
to
heavy
punishment
of
a
public
sort
and
are
become
local
heroes
by
consequence
that
is
the
very
mistake
which
was
at
first
made
in
the
missourian
village
half
a
century
ago
the
mistake
was
repeated
and
repeated
just
as
france
is
doing
in
these
latter
months
in
our
village
we
had
our
ravochals
our
henrys
our
vaillants
and
in
a
humble
way
our
cesario
i
hope
i
have
spelled
this
name
wrong
fifty
years
ago
we
passed
through
in
all
essentials
what
france
has
been
passing
through
during
the
past
two
or
three
years
in
the
matter
of
periodical
frights
horrors
and
shudderings
in
several
details
the
parallels
are
quaintly
exact
in
that
day
for
a
man
to
speak
out
openly
and
proclaim
himself
an
enemy
of
negro
slavery
was
simply
to
proclaim
himself
a
madman
for
he
was
blaspheming
against
the
holiest
thing
known
to
a
missourian
and
could
not
be
in
his
right
mind
for
a
man
to
proclaim
himself
an
anarchist
in
france
three
years
ago
was
to
proclaim
himself
a
madman
he
could
not
be
in
his
right
mind
now
the
original
old
first
blasphemer
against
any
institution
profoundly
venerated
by
a
community
is
quite
sure
to
be
in
earnest
his
followers
and
imitators
may
be
humbugs
and
self
seekers
but
he
himself
is
sincere
his
heart
is
in
his
protest
robert
hardy
was
our
first
abolitionist
awful
name
he
was
a
journeyman
cooper
and
worked
in
the
big
cooper
shop
belonging
to
the
great
pork
packing
establishment
which
was
marion
city's
chief
pride
and
sole
source
of
prosperity
he
was
a
new
englander
a
stranger
and
being
a
stranger
he
was
of
course
regarded
as
an
inferior
person
for
that
has
been
human
nature
from
adam
down
and
of
course
also
he
was
made
to
feel
unwelcome
for
this
is
the
ancient
law
with
man
and
the
other
animals
hardy
was
thirty
years
old
and
a
bachelor
pale
given
to
reverie
and
reading
he
was
reserved
and
seemed
to
prefer
the
isolation
which
had
fallen
to
his
lot
he
was
treated
to
many
side
remarks
by
his
fellows
but
as
he
did
not
resent
them
it
was
decided
that
he
was
a
coward
all
of
a
sudden
he
proclaimed
himself
an
abolitionist
straight
out
and
publicly
he
said
that
negro
slavery
was
a
crime
an
infamy
for
a
moment
the
town
was
paralyzed
with
astonishment
then
it
broke
into
a
fury
of
rage
and
swarmed
toward
the
cooper
shop
to
lynch
hardy
but
the
methodist
minister
made
a
powerful
speech
to
them
and
stayed
their
hands
he
proved
to
them
that
hardy
was
insane
and
not
responsible
for
his
words
that
no
man
could
be
sane
and
utter
such
words
so
hardy
was
saved
being
insane
he
was
allowed
to
go
on
talking
he
was
found
to
be
good
entertainment
several
nights
running
he
made
abolition
speeches
in
the
open
air
and
all
the
town
flocked
to
hear
and
laugh
he
implored
them
to
believe
him
sane
and
sincere
and
have
pity
on
the
poor
slaves
and
take
measures
for
the
restoration
of
their
stolen
rights
or
in
no
long
time
blood
would
flow
blood
blood
rivers
of
blood
it
was
great
fun
but
all
of
a
sudden
the
aspect
of
things
changed
a
slave
came
flying
from
palmyra
the
county
seat
a
few
miles
back
and
was
about
to
escape
in
a
canoe
to
illinois
and
freedom
in
the
dull
twilight
of
the
approaching
dawn
when
the
town
constable
seized
him
hardy
happened
along
and
tried
to
rescue
the
negro
there
was
a
struggle
and
the
constable
did
not
come
out
of
it
alive
hardy
crossed
the
river
with
the
negro
and
then
came
back
to
give
himself
up
all
this
took
time
for
the
mississippi
is
not
a
french
brook
like
the
seine
the
loire
and
those
other
rivulets
but
is
a
real
river
nearly
a
mile
wide
the
town
was
on
hand
in
force
by
now
but
the
methodist
preacher
and
the
sheriff
had
already
made
arrangements
in
the
interest
of
order
so
hardy
was
surrounded
by
a
strong
guard
and
safely
conveyed
to
the
village
calaboose
in
spite
of
all
the
effort
of
the
mob
to
get
hold
of
him
the
reader
will
have
begun
to
perceive
that
this
methodist
minister
was
a
prompt
man
a
prompt
man
with
active
hands
and
a
good
headpiece
williams
was
his
name
damon
williams
damon
williams
in
public
damnation
williams
in
private
because
he
was
so
powerful
on
that
theme
and
so
frequent
the
excitement
was
prodigious
the
constable
was
the
first
man
who
had
ever
been
killed
in
the
town
the
event
was
by
long
odds
the
most
imposing
in
the
town's
history
it
lifted
the
humble
village
into
sudden
importance
its
name
was
in
everybody's
mouth
for
twenty
miles
around
and
so
was
the
name
of
robert
hardy
robert
hardy
the
stranger
the
despised
in
a
day
he
was
become
the
person
of
most
consequence
in
the
region
the
only
person
talked
about
as
to
those
other
coopers
they
found
their
position
curiously
changed
they
were
important
people
or
unimportant
now
in
proportion
as
to
how
large
or
how
small
had
been
their
intercourse
with
the
new
celebrity
the
two
or
three
who
had
really
been
on
a
sort
of
familiar
footing
with
him
found
themselves
objects
of
admiring
interest
with
the
public
and
of
envy
with
their
shopmates
the
village
weekly
journal
had
lately
gone
into
new
hands
the
new
man
was
an
enterprising
fellow
and
he
made
the
most
of
the
tragedy
he
issued
an
extra
then
he
put
up
posters
promising
to
devote
his
whole
paper
to
matters
connected
with
the
great
event
there
would
be
a
full
and
intensely
interesting
biography
of
the
murderer
and
even
a
portrait
of
him
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
he
carved
the
portrait
himself
on
the
back
of
a
wooden
type
and
a
terror
it
was
to
look
at
it
made
a
great
commotion
for
this
was
the
first
time
the
village
paper
had
ever
contained
a
picture
the
village
was
very
proud
the
output
of
the
paper
was
ten
times
as
great
as
it
had
ever
been
before
yet
every
copy
was
sold
when
the
trial
came
on
people
came
from
all
the
farms
around
and
from
hannibal
and
quincy
and
even
from
keokuk
and
the
court
house
could
hold
only
a
fraction
of
the
crowd
that
applied
for
admission
the
trial
was
published
in
the
village
paper
with
fresh
and
still
more
trying
pictures
of
the
accused
hardy
was
convicted
and
hanged
a
mistake
people
came
from
miles
around
to
see
the
hanging
they
brought
cakes
and
cider
also
the
women
and
children
and
made
a
picnic
of
the
matter
it
was
the
largest
crowd
the
village
had
ever
seen
the
rope
that
hanged
hardy
was
eagerly
bought
up
in
inch
samples
for
everybody
wanted
a
memento
of
the
memorable
event
martyrdom
gilded
with
notoriety
has
its
fascinations
within
one
week
afterward
four
young
lightweights
in
the
village
proclaimed
themselves
abolitionists
in
life
hardy
had
not
been
able
to
make
a
convert
everybody
laughed
at
him
but
nobody
could
laugh
at
his
legacy
the
four
swaggered
around
with
their
slouch
hats
pulled
down
over
their
faces
and
hinted
darkly
at
awful
possibilities
the
people
were
troubled
and
afraid
and
showed
it
and
they
were
stunned
too
they
could
not
understand
it
abolitionist
had
always
been
a
term
of
shame
and
horror
yet
here
were
four
young
men
who
were
not
only
not
ashamed
to
bear
that
name
but
were
grimly
proud
of
it
respectable
young
men
they
were
too
of
good
families
and
brought
up
in
the
church
ed
smith
the
printer's
apprentice
nineteen
had
been
the
head
sunday
school
boy
and
had
once
recited
three
thousand
bible
verses
without
making
a
break
dick
savage
twenty
the
baker's
apprentice
will
joyce
twenty
two
journeyman
blacksmith
and
henry
taylor
twenty
four
tobacco
stemmer
were
the
other
three
they
were
all
of
a
sentimental
cast
they
were
all
romance
readers
they
all
wrote
poetry
such
as
it
was
they
were
all
vain
and
foolish
but
they
had
never
before
been
suspected
of
having
anything
bad
in
them
they
withdrew
from
society
and
grew
more
and
more
mysterious
and
dreadful
they
presently
achieved
the
distinction
of
being
denounced
by
names
from
the
pulpit
which
made
an
immense
stir
this
was
grandeur
this
was
fame
they
were
envied
by
all
the
other
young
fellows
now
this
was
natural
their
company
grew
grew
alarmingly
they
took
a
name
it
was
a
secret
name
and
was
divulged
to
no
outsider
publicly
they
were
simply
the
abolitionists
they
had
pass
words
grips
and
signs
they
had
secret
meetings
their
initiations
were
conducted
with
gloomy
pomps
and
ceremonies
at
midnight
they
always
spoke
of
hardy
as
the
martyr
and
every
little
while
they
moved
through
the
principal
street
in
procession
at
midnight
black
robed
masked
to
the
measured
tap
of
the
solemn
drum
on
pilgrimage
to
the
martyr's
grave
where
they
went
through
with
some
majestic
fooleries
and
swore
vengeance
upon
his
murderers
they
gave
previous
notice
of
the
pilgrimage
by
small
posters
and
warned
everybody
to
keep
indoors
and
darken
all
houses
along
the
route
and
leave
the
road
empty
these
warnings
were
obeyed
for
there
was
a
skull
and
crossbones
at
the
top
of
the
poster
when
this
kind
of
thing
had
been
going
on
about
eight
weeks
a
quite
natural
thing
happened
a
few
men
of
character
and
grit
woke
up
out
of
the
nightmare
of
fear
which
had
been
stupefying
their
faculties
and
began
to
discharge
scorn
and
scoffings
at
themselves
and
the
community
for
enduring
this
child's
play
and
at
the
same
time
they
proposed
to
end
it
straightway
everybody
felt
an
uplift
life
was
breathed
into
their
dead
spirits
their
courage
rose
and
they
began
to
feel
like
men
again
this
was
on
a
saturday
all
day
the
new
feeling
grew
and
strengthened
it
grew
with
a
rush
it
brought
inspiration
and
cheer
with
it
midnight
saw
a
united
community
full
of
zeal
and
pluck
and
with
a
clearly
defined
and
welcome
piece
of
work
in
front
of
it
the
best
organizer
and
strongest
and
bitterest
talker
on
that
great
saturday
was
the
presbyterian
clergyman
who
had
denounced
the
original
four
from
his
pulpit
rev
hiram
fletcher
and
he
promised
to
use
his
pulpit
in
the
public
interest
again
now
on
the
morrow
he
had
revelations
to
make
he
said
secrets
of
the
dreadful
society
but
the
revelations
were
never
made
at
half
past
two
in
the
morning
the
dead
silence
of
the
village
was
broken
by
a
crashing
explosion
and
the
town
patrol
saw
the
preacher's
house
spring
in
a
wreck
of
whirling
fragments
into
the
sky
the
preacher
was
killed
together
with
a
negro
woman
his
only
slave
and
servant
the
town
was
paralyzed
again
and
with
reason
to
struggle
against
a
visible
enemy
is
a
thing
worth
while
and
there
is
a
plenty
of
men
who
stand
always
ready
to
undertake
it
but
to
struggle
against
an
invisible
one
an
invisible
one
who
sneaks
in
and
does
his
awful
work
in
the
dark
and
leaves
no
trace
that
is
another
matter
that
is
a
thing
to
make
the
bravest
tremble
and
hold
back
the
cowed
populace
were
afraid
to
go
to
the
funeral
the
man
who
was
to
have
had
a
packed
church
to
hear
him
expose
and
denounce
the
common
enemy
had
but
a
handful
to
see
him
buried
the
coroner's
jury
had
brought
in
a
verdict
of
death
by
the
visitation
of
god
for
no
witness
came
forward
if
any
existed
they
prudently
kept
out
of
the
way
nobody
seemed
sorry
nobody
wanted
to
see
the
terrible
secret
society
provoked
into
the
commission
of
further
outrages
everybody
wanted
the
tragedy
hushed
up
ignored
forgotten
if
possible
and
so
there
was
a
bitter
surprise
and
an
unwelcome
one
when
will
joyce
the
blacksmith's
journeyman
came
out
and
proclaimed
himself
the
assassin
plainly
he
was
not
minded
to
be
robbed
of
his
glory
he
made
his
proclamation
and
stuck
to
it
stuck
to
it
and
insisted
upon
a
trial
here
was
an
ominous
thing
here
was
a
new
and
peculiarly
formidable
terror
for
a
motive
was
revealed
here
which
society
could
not
hope
to
deal
with
successfully
vanity
thirst
for
notoriety
if
men
were
going
to
kill
for
notoriety's
sake
and
to
win
the
glory
of
newspaper
renown
a
big
trial
and
a
showy
execution
what
possible
invention
of
man
could
discourage
or
deter
them
the
town
was
in
a
sort
of
panic
it
did
not
know
what
to
do
however
the
grand
jury
had
to
take
hold
of
the
matter
it
had
no
choice
it
brought
in
a
true
bill
and
presently
the
case
went
to
the
county
court
the
trial
was
a
fine
sensation
the
prisoner
was
the
principal
witness
for
the
prosecution
he
gave
a
full
account
of
the
assassination
he
furnished
even
the
minutest
particulars
how
he
deposited
his
keg
of
powder
and
laid
his
train
from
the
house
to
such
and
such
a
spot
how
george
ronalds
and
henry
hart
came
along
just
then
smoking
and
he
borrowed
hart's
cigar
and
fired
the
train
with
it
shouting
down
with
all
slave
tyrants
and
how
hart
and
ronalds
made
no
effort
to
capture
him
but
ran
away
and
had
never
come
forward
to
testify
yet
but
they
had
to
testify
now
and
they
did
and
pitiful
it
was
to
see
how
reluctant
they
were
and
how
scared
the
crowded
house
listened
to
joyce's
fearful
tale
with
a
profound
and
breathless
interest
and
in
a
deep
hush
which
was
not
broken
till
he
broke
it
himself
in
concluding
with
a
roaring
repetition
of
his
death
to
all
slave
tyrants
which
came
so
unexpectedly
and
so
startlingly
that
it
made
everyone
present
catch
his
breath
and
gasp
the
trial
was
put
in
the
paper
with
biography
and
large
portrait
with
other
slanderous
and
insane
pictures
and
the
edition
sold
beyond
imagination
the
execution
of
joyce
was
a
fine
and
picturesque
thing
it
drew
a
vast
crowd
good
places
in
trees
and
seats
on
rail
fences
sold
for
half
a
dollar
apiece
lemonade
and
gingerbread
stands
had
great
prosperity
joyce
recited
a
furious
and
fantastic
and
denunciatory
speech
on
the
scaffold
which
had
imposing
passages
of
school
boy
eloquence
in
it
and
gave
him
a
reputation
on
the
spot
as
an
orator
and
his
name
later
in
the
society's
records
of
the
martyr
orator
he
went
to
his
death
breathing
slaughter
and
charging
his
society
to
avenge
his
murder
if
he
knew
anything
of
human
nature
he
knew
that
to
plenty
of
young
fellows
present
in
that
great
crowd
he
was
a
grand
hero
and
enviably
situated
he
was
hanged
it
was
a
mistake
within
a
month
from
his
death
the
society
which
he
had
honored
had
twenty
new
members
some
of
them
earnest
determined
men
they
did
not
court
distinction
in
the
same
way
but
they
celebrated
his
martyrdom
the
crime
which
had
been
obscure
and
despised
had
become
lofty
and
glorified
such
things
were
happening
all
over
the
country
wild
brained
martyrdom
was
succeeded
by
uprising
and
organization
then
in
natural
order
followed
riot
insurrection
and
the
wrack
and
restitutions
of
war
it
was
bound
to
come
and
it
would
naturally
come
in
that
way
it
has
been
the
manner
of
reform
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
switzerland
the
cradle
of
liberty
interlaken
switzerland
it
is
a
good
many
years
since
i
was
in
switzerland
last
in
that
remote
time
there
was
only
one
ladder
railway
in
the
country
that
state
of
things
is
all
changed
there
isn't
a
mountain
in
switzerland
now
that
hasn't
a
ladder
railroad
or
two
up
its
back
like
suspenders
indeed
some
mountains
are
latticed
with
them
and
two
years
hence
all
will
be
in
that
day
the
peasant
of
the
high
altitudes
will
have
to
carry
a
lantern
when
he
goes
visiting
in
the
night
to
keep
from
stumbling
over
railroads
that
have
been
built
since
his
last
round
and
also
in
that
day
if
there
shall
remain
a
high
altitude
peasant
whose
potato
patch
hasn't
a
railroad
through
it
it
will
make
him
as
conspicuous
as
william
tell
however
there
are
only
two
best
ways
to
travel
through
switzerland
the
first
best
is
afoot
the
second
best
is
by
open
two
horse
carriage
one
can
come
from
lucerne
to
interlaken
over
the
brunig
by
ladder
railroad
in
an
hour
or
so
now
but
you
can
glide
smoothly
in
a
carriage
in
ten
and
have
two
hours
for
luncheon
at
noon
for
luncheon
not
for
rest
there
is
no
fatigue
connected
with
the
trip
one
arrives
fresh
in
spirit
and
in
person
in
the
evening
no
fret
in
his
heart
no
grime
on
his
face
no
grit
in
his
hair
not
a
cinder
in
his
eye
this
is
the
right
condition
of
mind
and
body
the
right
and
due
preparation
for
the
solemn
event
which
closed
the
day
stepping
with
metaphorically
uncovered
head
into
the
presence
of
the
most
impressive
mountain
mass
that
the
globe
can
show
the
jungfrau
the
stranger's
first
feeling
when
suddenly
confronted
by
that
towering
and
awful
apparition
wrapped
in
its
shroud
of
snow
is
breath
taking
astonishment
it
is
as
if
heaven's
gates
had
swung
open
and
exposed
the
throne
it
is
peaceful
here
and
pleasant
at
interlaken
nothing
going
on
at
least
nothing
but
brilliant
life
giving
sunshine
there
are
floods
and
floods
of
that
one
may
properly
speak
of
it
as
going
on
for
it
is
full
of
the
suggestion
of
activity
the
light
pours
down
with
energy
with
visible
enthusiasm
this
is
a
good
atmosphere
to
be
in
morally
as
well
as
physically
after
trying
the
political
atmosphere
of
the
neighboring
monarchies
it
is
healing
and
refreshing
to
breathe
in
air
that
has
known
no
taint
of
slavery
for
six
hundred
years
and
to
come
among
a
people
whose
political
history
is
great
and
fine
and
worthy
to
be
taught
in
all
schools
and
studied
by
all
races
and
peoples
for
the
struggle
here
throughout
the
centuries
has
not
been
in
the
interest
of
any
private
family
or
any
church
but
in
the
interest
of
the
whole
body
of
the
nation
and
for
shelter
and
protection
of
all
forms
of
belief
this
fact
is
colossal
if
one
would
realize
how
colossal
it
is
and
of
what
dignity
and
majesty
let
him
contrast
it
with
the
purposes
and
objects
of
the
crusades
the
siege
of
york
the
war
of
the
roses
and
other
historic
comedies
of
that
sort
and
size
last
week
i
was
beating
around
the
lake
of
four
cantons
and
i
saw
rutli
and
altorf
rutli
is
a
remote
little
patch
of
a
meadow
but
i
do
not
know
how
any
piece
of
ground
could
be
holier
or
better
worth
crossing
oceans
and
continents
to
see
since
it
was
there
that
the
great
trinity
of
switzerland
joined
hands
six
centuries
ago
and
swore
the
oath
which
set
their
enslaved
and
insulted
country
forever
free
and
altorf
is
also
honorable
ground
and
worshipful
since
it
was
there
that
william
surnamed
tell
which
interpreted
means
the
foolish
talker
that
is
to
say
the
too
daring
talker
refused
to
bow
to
gessler's
hat
of
late
years
the
prying
student
of
history
has
been
delighting
himself
beyond
measure
over
a
wonderful
find
which
he
has
made
to
wit
that
tell
did
not
shoot
the
apple
from
his
son's
head
to
hear
the
students
jubilate
one
would
suppose
that
the
question
of
whether
tell
shot
the
apple
or
didn't
was
an
important
matter
whereas
it
ranks
in
importance
exactly
with
the
question
of
whether
washington
chopped
down
the
cherry
tree
or
didn't
the
deeds
of
washington
the
patriot
are
the
essential
thing
the
cherry
tree
incident
is
of
no
consequence
to
prove
that
tell
did
shoot
the
apple
from
his
son's
head
would
merely
prove
that
he
had
better
nerve
than
most
men
and
was
as
skillful
with
a
bow
as
a
million
others
who
preceded
and
followed
him
but
not
one
whit
more
so
but
tell
was
more
and
better
than
a
mere
marksman
more
and
better
than
a
mere
cool
head
he
was
a
type
he
stands
for
swiss
patriotism
in
his
person
was
represented
a
whole
people
his
spirit
was
their
spirit
the
spirit
which
would
bow
to
none
but
god
the
spirit
which
said
this
in
words
and
confirmed
it
with
deeds
there
have
always
been
tells
in
switzerland
people
who
would
not
bow
there
was
a
sufficiency
of
them
at
rutli
there
were
plenty
of
them
at
murten
plenty
at
grandson
there
are
plenty
today
and
the
first
of
them
all
the
very
first
earliest
banner
bearer
of
human
freedom
in
this
world
was
not
a
man
but
a
woman
stauffacher's
wife
there
she
looms
dim
and
great
through
the
haze
of
the
centuries
delivering
into
her
husband's
ear
that
gospel
of
revolt
which
was
to
bear
fruit
in
the
conspiracy
of
rutli
and
the
birth
of
the
first
free
government
the
world
had
ever
seen
from
this
victoria
hotel
one
looks
straight
across
a
flat
of
trifling
width
to
a
lofty
mountain
barrier
which
has
a
gateway
in
it
shaped
like
an
inverted
pyramid
beyond
this
gateway
arises
the
vast
bulk
of
the
jungfrau
a
spotless
mass
of
gleaming
snow
into
the
sky
the
gateway
in
the
dark
colored
barrier
makes
a
strong
frame
for
the
great
picture
the
somber
frame
and
the
glowing
snow
pile
are
startlingly
contrasted
it
is
this
frame
which
concentrates
and
emphasizes
the
glory
of
the
jungfrau
and
makes
it
the
most
engaging
and
beguiling
and
fascinating
spectacle
that
exists
on
the
earth
there
are
many
mountains
of
snow
that
are
as
lofty
as
the
jungfrau
and
as
nobly
proportioned
but
they
lack
the
frame
they
stand
at
large
they
are
intruded
upon
and
elbowed
by
neighboring
domes
and
summits
and
their
grandeur
is
diminished
and
fails
of
effect
it
is
a
good
name
jungfrau
virgin
nothing
could
be
whiter
nothing
could
be
purer
nothing
could
be
saintlier
of
aspect
at
six
yesterday
evening
the
great
intervening
barrier
seen
through
a
faint
bluish
haze
seemed
made
of
air
and
substanceless
so
soft
and
rich
it
was
so
shimmering
where
the
wandering
lights
touched
it
and
so
dim
where
the
shadows
lay
apparently
it
was
a
dream
stuff
a
work
of
the
imagination
nothing
real
about
it
the
tint
was
green
slightly
varying
shades
of
it
but
mainly
very
dark
the
sun
was
down
as
far
as
that
barrier
was
concerned
but
not
for
the
jungfrau
towering
into
the
heavens
beyond
the
gateway
she
was
a
roaring
conflagration
of
blinding
white
it
is
said
the
fridolin
the
old
fridolin
a
new
saint
but
formerly
a
missionary
gave
the
mountain
its
gracious
name
he
was
an
irishman
son
of
an
irish
king
there
were
thirty
thousand
kings
reigning
in
county
cork
alone
in
his
time
fifteen
hundred
years
ago
it
got
so
that
they
could
not
make
a
living
there
was
so
much
competition
and
wages
got
cut
so
some
of
them
were
out
of
work
months
at
a
time
with
wife
and
little
children
to
feed
and
not
a
crust
in
the
place
at
last
a
particularly
severe
winter
fell
upon
the
country
and
hundreds
of
them
were
reduced
to
mendicancy
and
were
to
be
seen
day
after
day
in
the
bitterest
weather
standing
barefoot
in
the
snow
holding
out
their
crowns
for
alms
indeed
they
would
have
been
obliged
to
emigrate
or
starve
but
for
a
fortunate
idea
of
prince
fridolin's
who
started
a
labor
union
the
first
one
in
history
and
got
the
great
bulk
of
them
to
join
it
he
thus
won
the
general
gratitude
and
they
wanted
to
make
him
emperor
emperor
over
them
all
emperor
of
county
cork
but
he
said
no
walking
delegate
was
good
enough
for
him
for
behold
he
was
modest
beyond
his
years
and
keen
as
a
whip
to
this
day
in
germany
and
switzerland
where
st
fridolin
is
revered
and
honored
the
peasantry
speak
of
him
affectionately
as
the
first
walking
delegate
the
first
walk
he
took
was
into
france
and
germany
missionarying
for
missionarying
was
a
better
thing
in
those
days
than
it
is
in
ours
all
you
had
to
do
was
to
cure
the
head
savage's
sick
daughter
by
a
miracle
a
miracle
like
the
miracle
of
lourdes
in
our
day
for
instance
and
immediately
that
head
savage
was
your
convert
and
filled
to
the
eyes
with
a
new
convert's
enthusiasm
you
could
sit
down
and
make
yourself
easy
now
he
would
take
an
ax
and
convert
the
rest
of
the
nation
himself
charlemagne
was
that
kind
of
a
walking
delegate
yes
there
were
great
missionaries
in
those
days
for
the
methods
were
sure
and
the
rewards
great
we
have
no
such
missionaries
now
and
no
such
methods
but
to
continue
the
history
of
the
first
walking
delegate
if
you
are
interested
i
am
interested
myself
because
i
have
seen
his
relics
in
sackingen
and
also
the
very
spot
where
he
worked
his
great
miracle
the
one
which
won
him
his
sainthood
in
the
papal
court
a
few
centuries
later
to
have
seen
these
things
makes
me
feel
very
near
to
him
almost
like
a
member
of
the
family
in
fact
while
wandering
about
the
continent
he
arrived
at
the
spot
on
the
rhine
which
is
now
occupied
by
sackingen
and
proposed
to
settle
there
but
the
people
warned
him
off
he
appealed
to
the
king
of
the
franks
who
made
him
a
present
of
the
whole
region
people
and
all
he
built
a
great
cloister
there
for
women
and
proceeded
to
teach
in
it
and
accumulate
more
land
there
were
two
wealthy
brothers
in
the
neighborhood
urso
and
landulph
urso
died
and
fridolin
claimed
his
estates
landulph
asked
for
documents
and
papers
fridolin
had
none
to
show
he
said
the
bequest
had
been
made
to
him
by
word
of
mouth
landulph
suggested
that
he
produce
a
witness
and
said
it
in
a
way
which
he
thought
was
very
witty
very
sarcastic
this
shows
that
he
did
not
know
the
walking
delegate
fridolin
was
not
disturbed
he
said
appoint
your
court
i
will
bring
a
witness
the
court
thus
created
consisted
of
fifteen
counts
and
barons
a
day
was
appointed
for
the
trial
of
the
case
on
that
day
the
judges
took
their
seats
in
state
and
proclamation
was
made
that
the
court
was
ready
for
business
five
minutes
ten
minutes
fifteen
minutes
passed
and
yet
no
fridolin
appeared
landulph
rose
and
was
in
the
act
of
claiming
judgment
by
default
when
a
strange
clacking
sound
was
heard
coming
up
the
stairs
in
another
moment
fridolin
entered
at
the
door
and
came
walking
in
a
deep
hush
down
the
middle
aisle
with
a
tall
skeleton
stalking
in
his
rear
amazement
and
terror
sat
upon
every
countenance
for
everybody
suspected
that
the
skeleton
was
urso's
it
stopped
before
the
chief
judge
and
raised
its
bony
arm
aloft
and
began
to
speak
while
all
the
assembly
shuddered
for
they
could
see
the
words
leak
out
between
its
ribs
it
said
brother
why
dost
thou
disturb
my
blessed
rest
and
withhold
by
robbery
the
gift
which
i
gave
thee
for
the
honor
of
god
it
seems
a
strange
thing
and
most
irregular
but
the
verdict
was
actually
given
against
landulph
on
the
testimony
of
this
wandering
rack
heap
of
unidentified
bones
in
our
day
a
skeleton
would
not
be
allowed
to
testify
at
all
for
a
skeleton
has
no
moral
responsibility
and
its
word
could
not
be
believed
on
oath
and
this
was
probably
one
of
them
most
skeletons
are
not
to
be
believed
on
oath
and
this
was
probably
one
of
them
however
the
incident
is
valuable
as
preserving
to
us
a
curious
sample
of
the
quaint
laws
of
evidence
of
that
remote
time
a
time
so
remote
so
far
back
toward
the
beginning
of
original
idiocy
that
the
difference
between
a
bench
of
judges
and
a
basket
of
vegetables
was
as
yet
so
slight
that
we
may
say
with
all
confidence
that
it
didn't
really
exist
during
several
afternoons
i
have
been
engaged
in
an
interesting
maybe
useful
piece
of
work
that
is
to
say
i
have
been
trying
to
make
the
mighty
jungfrau
earn
her
living
earn
it
in
a
most
humble
sphere
but
on
a
prodigious
scale
on
a
prodigious
scale
of
necessity
for
she
couldn't
do
anything
in
a
small
way
with
her
size
and
style
i
have
been
trying
to
make
her
do
service
on
a
stupendous
dial
and
check
off
the
hours
as
they
glide
along
her
pallid
face
up
there
against
the
sky
and
tell
the
time
of
day
to
the
populations
lying
within
fifty
miles
of
her
and
to
the
people
in
the
moon
if
they
have
a
good
telescope
there
until
late
in
the
afternoon
the
jungfrau's
aspect
is
that
of
a
spotless
desert
of
snow
set
upon
edge
against
the
sky
but
by
mid
afternoon
some
elevations
which
rise
out
of
the
western
border
of
the
desert
whose
presence
you
perhaps
had
not
detected
or
suspected
up
to
that
time
began
to
cast
black
shadows
eastward
across
the
gleaming
surface
at
first
there
is
only
one
shadow
later
there
are
two
toward
p
m
the
other
day
i
was
gazing
and
worshiping
as
usual
when
i
chanced
to
notice
that
shadow
no
was
beginning
to
take
itself
something
of
the
shape
of
the
human
profile
by
four
the
back
of
the
head
was
good
the
military
cap
was
pretty
good
the
nose
was
bold
and
strong
the
upper
lip
sharp
but
not
pretty
and
there
was
a
great
goatee
that
shot
straight
aggressively
forward
from
the
chin
at
four
thirty
the
nose
had
changed
its
shape
considerably
and
the
altered
slant
of
the
sun
had
revealed
and
made
conspicuous
a
huge
buttress
or
barrier
of
naked
rock
which
was
so
located
as
to
answer
very
well
for
a
shoulder
or
coat
collar
to
this
swarthy
and
indiscreet
sweetheart
who
had
stolen
out
there
right
before
everybody
to
pillow
his
head
on
the
virgin's
white
breast
and
whisper
soft
sentimentalities
to
her
in
the
sensuous
music
of
the
crashing
ice
domes
and
the
boom
and
thunder
of
the
passing
avalanche
music
very
familiar
to
his
ear
for
he
has
heard
it
every
afternoon
at
this
hour
since
the
day
he
first
came
courting
this
child
of
the
earth
who
lives
in
the
sky
and
that
day
is
far
yes
for
he
was
at
this
pleasant
sport
before
the
middle
ages
drifted
by
him
in
the
valley
before
the
romans
marched
past
and
before
the
antique
and
recordless
barbarians
fished
and
hunted
here
and
wondered
who
he
might
be
and
were
probably
afraid
of
him
and
before
primeval
man
himself
just
emerged
from
his
four
footed
estate
stepped
out
upon
this
plain
first
sample
of
his
race
a
thousand
centuries
ago
and
cast
a
glad
eye
up
there
judging
he
had
found
a
brother
human
being
and
consequently
something
to
kill
and
before
the
big
saurians
wallowed
here
still
some
eons
earlier
oh
yes
a
day
so
far
back
that
the
eternal
son
was
present
to
see
that
first
visit
a
day
so
far
back
that
neither
tradition
nor
history
was
born
yet
and
a
whole
weary
eternity
must
come
and
go
before
the
restless
little
creature
of
whose
face
this
stupendous
shadow
face
was
the
prophecy
would
arrive
in
the
earth
and
begin
his
shabby
career
and
think
it
a
big
thing
oh
indeed
yes
when
you
talk
about
your
poor
roman
and
egyptian
day
before
yesterday
antiquities
you
should
choose
a
time
when
the
hoary
shadow
face
of
the
jungfrau
is
not
by
it
antedates
all
antiquities
known
or
imaginable
for
it
was
here
the
world
itself
created
the
theater
of
future
antiquities
and
it
is
the
only
witness
with
a
human
face
that
was
there
to
see
the
marvel
and
remains
to
us
a
memorial
of
it
by
p
m
the
nose
of
the
shadow
is
perfect
and
is
beautiful
it
is
black
and
is
powerfully
marked
against
the
upright
canvas
of
glowing
snow
and
covers
hundreds
of
acres
of
that
resplendent
surface
meantime
shadow
no
has
been
creeping
out
well
to
the
rear
of
the
face
west
of
it
and
at
five
o'clock
has
assumed
a
shape
that
has
rather
a
poor
and
rude
semblance
of
a
shoe
meantime
also
the
great
shadow
face
has
been
gradually
changing
for
twenty
minutes
and
now
p
m
it
is
becoming
a
quite
fair
portrait
of
roscoe
conkling
the
likeness
is
there
and
is
unmistakable
the
goatee
is
shortened
now
and
has
an
end
formerly
it
hadn't
any
but
ran
off
eastward
and
arrived
nowhere
by
p
m
the
face
has
dissolved
and
gone
and
the
goatee
has
become
what
looks
like
the
shadow
of
a
tower
with
a
pointed
roof
and
the
shoe
had
turned
into
what
the
printers
call
a
fist
with
a
finger
pointing
if
i
were
now
imprisoned
on
a
mountain
summit
a
hundred
miles
northward
of
this
point
and
was
denied
a
timepiece
i
could
get
along
well
enough
from
four
till
six
on
clear
days
for
i
could
keep
trace
of
the
time
by
the
changing
shapes
of
these
mighty
shadows
on
the
virgin's
front
the
most
stupendous
dial
i
am
acquainted
with
the
oldest
clock
in
the
world
by
a
couple
of
million
years
i
suppose
i
should
not
have
noticed
the
forms
of
the
shadows
if
i
hadn't
the
habit
of
hunting
for
faces
in
the
clouds
and
in
mountain
crags
a
sort
of
amusement
which
is
very
entertaining
even
when
you
don't
find
any
and
brilliantly
satisfying
when
you
do
i
have
searched
through
several
bushels
of
photographs
of
the
jungfrau
here
but
found
only
one
with
the
face
in
it
and
in
this
case
it
was
not
strictly
recognizable
as
a
face
which
was
evidence
that
the
picture
was
taken
before
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
and
also
evidence
that
all
the
photographers
have
persistently
overlooked
one
of
the
most
fascinating
features
of
the
jungfrau
show
i
say
fascinating
because
if
you
once
detect
a
human
face
produced
on
a
great
plan
by
unconscious
nature
you
never
get
tired
of
watching
it
at
first
you
can't
make
another
person
see
it
at
all
but
after
he
has
made
it
out
once
he
can't
see
anything
else
afterward
the
king
of
greece
is
a
man
who
goes
around
quietly
enough
when
off
duty
one
day
this
summer
he
was
traveling
in
an
ordinary
first
class
compartment
just
in
his
other
suit
the
one
which
he
works
the
realm
in
when
he
is
at
home
and
so
he
was
not
looking
like
anybody
in
particular
but
a
good
deal
like
everybody
in
general
by
and
by
a
hearty
and
healthy
german
american
got
in
and
opened
up
a
frank
and
interesting
and
sympathetic
conversation
with
him
and
asked
him
a
couple
of
thousand
questions
about
himself
which
the
king
answered
good
naturedly
but
in
a
more
or
less
indefinite
way
as
to
private
particulars
where
do
you
live
when
you
are
at
home
in
greece
greece
well
now
that
is
just
astonishing
born
there
no
do
you
speak
greek
yes
now
ain't
that
strange
i
never
expected
to
live
to
see
that
what
is
your
trade
i
mean
how
do
you
get
your
living
what
is
your
line
of
business
well
i
hardly
know
how
to
answer
i
am
only
a
kind
of
foreman
on
a
salary
and
the
business
well
is
a
very
general
kind
of
business
yes
i
understand
general
jobbing
little
of
everything
anything
that
there's
money
in
that's
about
it
yes
are
you
traveling
for
the
house
now
well
partly
but
not
entirely
of
course
i
do
a
stroke
of
business
if
it
falls
in
the
way
good
i
like
that
in
you
that's
me
every
time
go
on
i
was
only
going
to
say
i
am
off
on
my
vacation
now
well
that's
all
right
no
harm
in
that
a
man
works
all
the
better
for
a
little
let
up
now
and
then
not
that
i've
been
used
to
having
it
myself
for
i
haven't
i
reckon
this
is
my
first
i
was
born
in
germany
and
when
i
was
a
couple
of
weeks
old
shipped
for
america
and
i've
been
there
ever
since
and
that's
sixty
four
years
by
the
watch
i'm
an
american
in
principle
and
a
german
at
heart
and
it's
the
boss
combination
well
how
do
you
get
along
as
a
rule
pretty
fair
i've
a
rather
large
family
there
that's
it
big
family
and
trying
to
raise
them
on
a
salary
now
what
did
you
go
to
do
that
for
well
i
thought
of
course
you
did
you
were
young
and
confident
and
thought
you
could
branch
out
and
make
things
go
with
a
whirl
and
here
you
are
you
see
but
never
mind
about
that
i'm
not
trying
to
discourage
you
dear
me
i've
been
just
where
you
are
myself
you've
got
good
grit
there's
good
stuff
in
you
i
can
see
that
you
got
a
wrong
start
that's
the
whole
trouble
but
you
hold
your
grip
and
we'll
see
what
can
be
done
your
case
ain't
half
as
bad
as
it
might
be
you
are
going
to
come
out
all
right
i'm
bail
for
that
boys
and
girls
my
family
yes
some
of
them
are
boys
and
the
rest
girls
it's
just
as
i
expected
but
that's
all
right
and
it's
better
so
anyway
what
are
the
boys
doing
learning
a
trade
well
no
i
thought
it's
a
great
mistake
it's
the
biggest
mistake
you
ever
made
you
see
that
in
your
own
case
a
man
ought
always
to
have
a
trade
to
fall
back
on
now
i
was
harness
maker
at
first
did
that
prevent
me
from
becoming
one
of
the
biggest
brewers
in
america
oh
no
i
always
had
the
harness
trick
to
fall
back
on
in
rough
weather
now
if
you
had
learned
how
to
make
harness
however
it's
too
late
now
too
late
but
it's
no
good
plan
to
cry
over
spilt
milk
but
as
to
the
boys
you
see
what's
to
become
of
them
if
anything
happens
to
you
it
has
been
my
idea
to
let
the
eldest
one
succeed
me
oh
come
suppose
the
firm
don't
want
him
i
hadn't
thought
of
that
but
now
look
here
you
want
to
get
right
down
to
business
and
stop
dreaming
you
are
capable
of
immense
things
man
you
can
make
a
perfect
success
in
life
all
you
want
is
somebody
to
steady
you
and
boost
you
along
on
the
right
road
do
you
own
anything
in
the
business
no
not
exactly
but
if
i
continue
to
give
satisfaction
i
suppose
i
can
keep
my
keep
your
place
yes
well
don't
you
depend
on
anything
of
the
kind
they'll
bounce
you
the
minute
you
get
a
little
old
and
worked
out
they'll
do
it
sure
can't
you
manage
somehow
to
get
into
the
firm
that's
the
great
thing
you
know
i
think
it
is
doubtful
very
doubtful
um
that's
bad
yes
and
unfair
too
do
you
suppose
that
if
i
should
go
there
and
have
a
talk
with
your
people
look
here
do
you
think
you
could
run
a
brewery
i
have
never
tried
but
i
think
i
could
do
it
after
i
got
a
little
familiarity
with
the
business
the
german
was
silent
for
some
time
he
did
a
good
deal
of
thinking
and
the
king
waited
with
curiosity
to
see
what
the
result
was
going
to
be
finally
the
german
said
my
mind's
made
up
you
leave
that
crowd
you'll
never
amount
to
anything
there
in
these
old
countries
they
never
give
a
fellow
a
show
yes
you
come
over
to
america
come
to
my
place
in
rochester
bring
the
family
along
you
shall
have
a
show
in
the
business
and
the
foremanship
besides
george
you
said
your
name
was
george
i'll
make
a
man
of
you
i
give
you
my
word
you've
never
had
a
chance
here
but
that's
all
going
to
change
by
gracious
i'll
give
you
a
lift
that'll
make
your
hair
curl
at
the
shrine
of
st
wagner
bayreuth
aug
it
was
at
nuremberg
that
we
struck
the
inundation
of
music
mad
strangers
that
was
rolling
down
upon
bayreuth
it
had
been
long
since
we
had
seen
such
multitudes
of
excited
and
struggling
people
it
took
a
good
half
hour
to
pack
them
and
pair
them
into
the
train
and
it
was
the
longest
train
we
have
yet
seen
in
europe
nuremberg
had
been
witnessing
this
sort
of
experience
a
couple
of
times
a
day
for
about
two
weeks
it
gives
one
an
impressive
sense
of
the
magnitude
of
this
biennial
pilgrimage
for
a
pilgrimage
is
what
it
is
the
devotees
come
from
the
very
ends
of
the
earth
to
worship
their
prophet
in
his
own
kaaba
in
his
own
mecca
if
you
are
living
in
new
york
or
san
francisco
or
chicago
or
anywhere
else
in
america
and
you
conclude
by
the
middle
of
may
that
you
would
like
to
attend
the
bayreuth
opera
two
months
and
a
half
later
you
must
use
the
cable
and
get
about
it
immediately
or
you
will
get
no
seats
and
you
must
cable
for
lodgings
too
then
if
you
are
lucky
you
will
get
seats
in
the
last
row
and
lodgings
in
the
fringe
of
the
town
if
you
stop
to
write
you
will
get
nothing
there
were
plenty
of
people
in
nuremberg
when
we
passed
through
who
had
come
on
pilgrimage
without
first
securing
seats
and
lodgings
they
had
found
neither
in
bayreuth
they
had
walked
bayreuth
streets
a
while
in
sorrow
then
had
gone
to
nuremberg
and
found
neither
beds
nor
standing
room
and
had
walked
those
quaint
streets
all
night
waiting
for
the
hotels
to
open
and
empty
their
guests
into
the
trains
and
so
make
room
for
these
their
defeated
brethren
and
sisters
in
the
faith
they
had
endured
from
thirty
to
forty
hours
railroading
on
the
continent
of
europe
with
all
which
that
implies
of
worry
fatigue
and
financial
impoverishment
and
all
they
had
got
and
all
they
were
to
get
for
it
was
handiness
and
accuracy
in
kicking
themselves
acquired
by
practice
in
the
back
streets
of
the
two
towns
when
other
people
were
in
bed
for
back
they
must
go
over
that
unspeakable
journey
with
their
pious
mission
unfulfilled
these
humiliated
outcasts
had
the
frowsy
and
unbrushed
and
apologetic
look
of
wet
cats
and
their
eyes
were
glazed
with
drowsiness
their
bodies
were
adroop
from
crown
to
sole
and
all
kind
hearted
people
refrained
from
asking
them
if
they
had
been
to
bayreuth
and
failed
to
connect
as
knowing
they
would
lie
we
reached
here
bayreuth
about
mid
afternoon
of
a
rainy
saturday
we
were
of
the
wise
and
had
secured
lodgings
and
opera
seats
months
in
advance
i
am
not
a
musical
critic
and
did
not
come
here
to
write
essays
about
the
operas
and
deliver
judgment
upon
their
merits
the
little
children
of
bayreuth
could
do
that
with
a
finer
sympathy
and
a
broader
intelligence
than
i
i
only
care
to
bring
four
or
five
pilgrims
to
the
operas
pilgrims
able
to
appreciate
them
and
enjoy
them
what
i
write
about
the
performance
to
put
in
my
odd
time
would
be
offered
to
the
public
as
merely
a
cat's
view
of
a
king
and
not
of
didactic
value
next
day
which
was
sunday
we
left
for
the
opera
house
that
is
to
say
the
wagner
temple
a
little
after
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
great
building
stands
all
by
itself
grand
and
lonely
on
a
high
ground
outside
the
town
we
were
warned
that
if
we
arrived
after
four
o'clock
we
should
be
obliged
to
pay
two
dollars
and
a
half
apiece
extra
by
way
of
fine
we
saved
that
and
it
may
be
remarked
here
that
this
is
the
only
opportunity
that
europe
offers
of
saving
money
there
was
a
big
crowd
in
the
grounds
about
the
building
and
the
ladies
dresses
took
the
sun
with
fine
effect
i
do
not
mean
to
intimate
that
the
ladies
were
in
full
dress
for
that
was
not
so
the
dresses
were
pretty
but
neither
sex
was
in
evening
dress
the
interior
of
the
building
is
simple
severely
so
but
there
is
no
occasion
for
color
and
decoration
since
the
people
sit
in
the
dark
the
auditorium
has
the
shape
of
a
keystone
with
the
stage
at
the
narrow
end
there
is
an
aisle
on
each
side
but
no
aisle
in
the
body
of
the
house
each
row
of
seats
extends
in
an
unbroken
curve
from
one
side
of
the
house
to
the
other
there
are
seven
entrance
doors
on
each
side
of
the
theater
and
four
at
the
butt
eighteen
doors
to
admit
and
emit
persons
the
number
of
the
particular
door
by
which
you
are
to
enter
the
house
or
leave
it
is
printed
on
your
ticket
and
you
can
use
no
door
but
that
one
thus
crowding
and
confusion
are
impossible
not
so
many
as
a
hundred
people
use
any
one
door
this
is
better
than
having
the
usual
and
useless
elaborate
fireproof
arrangements
it
is
the
model
theater
of
the
world
it
can
be
emptied
while
the
second
hand
of
a
watch
makes
its
circuit
it
would
be
entirely
safe
even
if
it
were
built
of
lucifer
matches
if
your
seat
is
near
the
center
of
a
row
and
you
enter
late
you
must
work
your
way
along
a
rank
of
about
twenty
five
ladies
and
gentlemen
to
get
to
it
yet
this
causes
no
trouble
for
everybody
stands
up
until
all
the
seats
are
full
and
the
filling
is
accomplished
in
a
very
few
minutes
then
all
sit
down
and
you
have
a
solid
mass
of
fifteen
hundred
heads
making
a
steep
cellar
door
slant
from
the
rear
of
the
house
down
to
the
stage
all
the
lights
were
turned
low
so
low
that
the
congregation
sat
in
a
deep
and
solemn
gloom
the
funereal
rustling
of
dresses
and
the
low
buzz
of
conversation
began
to
die
swiftly
down
and
presently
not
the
ghost
of
a
sound
was
left
this
profound
and
increasingly
impressive
stillness
endured
for
some
time
the
best
preparation
for
music
spectacle
or
speech
conceivable
i
should
think
our
show
people
would
have
invented
or
imported
that
simple
and
impressive
device
for
securing
and
solidifying
the
attention
of
an
audience
long
ago
instead
of
which
they
continue
to
this
day
to
open
a
performance
against
a
deadly
competition
in
the
form
of
noise
confusion
and
a
scattered
interest
finally
out
of
darkness
and
distance
and
mystery
soft
rich
notes
rose
upon
the
stillness
and
from
his
grave
the
dead
magician
began
to
weave
his
spells
about
his
disciples
and
steep
their
souls
in
his
enchantments
there
was
something
strangely
impressive
in
the
fancy
which
kept
intruding
itself
that
the
composer
was
conscious
in
his
grave
of
what
was
going
on
here
and
that
these
divine
sounds
were
the
clothing
of
thoughts
which
were
at
this
moment
passing
through
his
brain
and
not
recognized
and
familiar
ones
which
had
issued
from
it
at
some
former
time
the
entire
overture
long
as
it
was
was
played
to
a
dark
house
with
the
curtain
down
it
was
exquisite
it
was
delicious
but
straightway
thereafter
of
course
came
the
singing
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
nothing
can
make
a
wagner
opera
absolutely
perfect
and
satisfactory
to
the
untutored
but
to
leave
out
the
vocal
parts
i
wish
i
could
see
a
wagner
opera
done
in
pantomime
once
then
one
would
have
the
lovely
orchestration
unvexed
to
listen
to
and
bathe
his
spirit
in
and
the
bewildering
beautiful
scenery
to
intoxicate
his
eyes
with
and
the
dumb
acting
couldn't
mar
these
pleasures
because
there
isn't
often
anything
in
the
wagner
opera
that
one
would
call
by
such
a
violent
name
as
acting
as
a
rule
all
you
would
see
would
be
a
couple
of
silent
people
one
of
them
standing
still
the
other
catching
flies
of
course
i
do
not
really
mean
that
he
would
be
catching
flies
i
only
mean
that
the
usual
operatic
gestures
which
consist
in
reaching
first
one
hand
out
into
the
air
and
then
the
other
might
suggest
the
sport
i
speak
of
if
the
operator
attended
strictly
to
business
and
uttered
no
sound
this
present
opera
was
parsifal
madame
wagner
does
not
permit
its
representation
anywhere
but
in
bayreuth
the
first
act
of
the
three
occupied
two
hours
and
i
enjoyed
that
in
spite
of
the
singing
i
trust
that
i
know
as
well
as
anybody
that
singing
is
one
of
the
most
entrancing
and
bewitching
and
moving
and
eloquent
of
all
the
vehicles
invented
by
man
for
the
conveying
of
feeling
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
chief
virtue
in
song
is
melody
air
tune
rhythm
or
what
you
please
to
call
it
and
that
when
this
feature
is
absent
what
remains
is
a
picture
with
the
color
left
out
i
was
not
able
to
detect
in
the
vocal
parts
of
parsifal
anything
that
might
with
confidence
be
called
rhythm
or
tune
or
melody
one
person
performed
at
a
time
and
a
long
time
too
often
in
a
noble
and
always
in
a
high
toned
voice
but
he
only
pulled
out
long
notes
then
some
short
ones
then
another
long
one
then
a
sharp
quick
peremptory
bark
or
two
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
when
he
was
done
you
saw
that
the
information
which
he
had
conveyed
had
not
compensated
for
the
disturbance
not
always
but
pretty
often
if
two
of
them
would
but
put
in
a
duet
occasionally
and
blend
the
voices
but
no
they
don't
do
that
the
great
master
who
knew
so
well
how
to
make
a
hundred
instruments
rejoice
in
unison
and
pour
out
their
souls
in
mingled
and
melodious
tides
of
delicious
sound
deals
only
in
barren
solos
when
he
puts
in
the
vocal
parts
it
may
be
that
he
was
deep
and
only
added
the
singing
to
his
operas
for
the
sake
of
the
contrast
it
would
make
with
the
music
singing
it
does
seem
the
wrong
name
to
apply
to
it
strictly
described
it
is
a
practicing
of
difficult
and
unpleasant
intervals
mainly
an
ignorant
person
gets
tired
of
listening
to
gymnastic
intervals
in
the
long
run
no
matter
how
pleasant
they
may
be
in
parsifal
there
is
a
hermit
named
gurnemanz
who
stands
on
the
stage
in
one
spot
and
practices
by
the
hour
while
first
one
and
then
another
character
of
the
cast
endures
what
he
can
of
it
and
then
retires
to
die
during
the
evening
there
was
an
intermission
of
three
quarters
of
an
hour
after
the
first
act
and
one
an
hour
long
after
the
second
in
both
instances
the
theater
was
totally
emptied
people
who
had
previously
engaged
tables
in
the
one
sole
eating
house
were
able
to
put
in
their
time
very
satisfactorily
the
other
thousand
went
hungry
the
opera
was
concluded
at
ten
in
the
evening
or
a
little
later
when
we
reached
home
we
had
been
gone
more
than
seven
hours
seven
hours
at
five
dollars
a
ticket
is
almost
too
much
for
the
money
while
browsing
about
the
front
yard
among
the
crowd
between
the
acts
i
encountered
twelve
or
fifteen
friends
from
different
parts
of
america
and
those
of
them
who
were
most
familiar
with
wagner
said
that
parsifal
seldom
pleased
at
first
but
that
after
one
had
heard
it
several
times
it
was
almost
sure
to
become
a
favorite
it
seemed
impossible
but
it
was
true
for
the
statement
came
from
people
whose
word
was
not
to
be
doubted
and
i
gathered
some
further
information
on
the
ground
i
found
part
of
a
german
musical
magazine
and
in
it
a
letter
written
by
uhlic
thirty
three
years
ago
in
which
he
defends
the
scorned
and
abused
wagner
against
people
like
me
who
found
fault
with
the
comprehensive
absence
of
what
our
kind
regards
as
singing
uhlic
says
wagner
despised
jene
plapperude
music
and
therefore
runs
trills
and
schnorkel
are
discarded
by
him
i
don't
know
what
a
schnorkel
is
but
now
that
i
know
it
has
been
left
out
of
these
operas
i
never
have
missed
so
much
in
my
life
and
uhlic
further
says
that
wagner's
song
is
true
that
it
is
simply
emphasized
intoned
speech
that
certainly
describes
it
in
parsifal
and
some
of
the
other
operas
and
if
i
understand
uhlic's
elaborate
german
he
apologizes
for
the
beautiful
airs
in
tannhauser
very
well
now
that
wagner
and
i
understand
each
other
perhaps
we
shall
get
along
better
and
i
shall
stop
calling
waggner
on
the
american
plan
and
thereafter
call
him
waggner
as
per
german
custom
for
i
feel
entirely
friendly
now
the
minute
we
get
reconciled
to
a
person
how
willing
we
are
to
throw
aside
little
needless
punctilios
and
pronounce
his
name
right
of
course
i
came
home
wondering
why
people
should
come
from
all
corners
of
america
to
hear
these
operas
when
we
have
lately
had
a
season
or
two
of
them
in
new
york
with
these
same
singers
in
the
several
parts
and
possibly
this
same
orchestra
i
resolved
to
think
that
out
at
all
hazards
tuesday
yesterday
they
played
the
only
operatic
favorite
i
have
ever
had
an
opera
which
has
always
driven
me
mad
with
ignorant
delight
whenever
i
have
heard
it
tannhauser
i
heard
it
first
when
i
was
a
youth
i
heard
it
last
in
the
last
german
season
in
new
york
i
was
busy
yesterday
and
i
did
not
intend
to
go
knowing
i
should
have
another
tannhauser
opportunity
in
a
few
days
but
after
five
o'clock
i
found
myself
free
and
walked
out
to
the
opera
house
and
arrived
about
the
beginning
of
the
second
act
my
opera
ticket
admitted
me
to
the
grounds
in
front
past
the
policeman
and
the
chain
and
i
thought
i
would
take
a
rest
on
a
bench
for
an
hour
and
two
and
wait
for
the
third
act
in
a
moment
or
so
the
first
bugles
blew
and
the
multitude
began
to
crumble
apart
and
melt
into
the
theater
i
will
explain
that
this
bugle
call
is
one
of
the
pretty
features
here
you
see
the
theater
is
empty
and
hundreds
of
the
audience
are
a
good
way
off
in
the
feeding
house
the
first
bugle
call
is
blown
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
time
for
the
curtain
to
rise
this
company
of
buglers
in
uniform
march
out
with
military
step
and
send
out
over
the
landscape
a
few
bars
of
the
theme
of
the
approaching
act
piercing
the
distances
with
the
gracious
notes
then
they
march
to
the
other
entrance
and
repeat
presently
they
do
this
over
again
yesterday
only
about
two
hundred
people
were
still
left
in
front
of
the
house
when
the
second
call
was
blown
in
another
half
minute
they
would
have
been
in
the
house
but
then
a
thing
happened
which
delayed
them
the
only
solitary
thing
in
this
world
which
could
be
relied
on
with
certainty
to
accomplish
this
i
suppose
an
imperial
princess
appeared
in
the
balcony
above
them
they
stopped
dead
in
their
tracks
and
began
to
gaze
in
a
stupor
of
gratitude
and
satisfaction
the
lady
presently
saw
that
she
must
disappear
or
the
doors
would
be
closed
upon
these
worshipers
so
she
returned
to
her
box
this
daughter
in
law
of
an
emperor
was
pretty
she
had
a
kind
face
she
was
without
airs
she
is
known
to
be
full
of
common
human
sympathies
there
are
many
kinds
of
princesses
but
this
kind
is
the
most
harmful
of
all
for
wherever
they
go
they
reconcile
people
to
monarchy
and
set
back
the
clock
of
progress
the
valuable
princes
the
desirable
princes
are
the
czars
and
their
sort
by
their
mere
dumb
presence
in
the
world
they
cover
with
derision
every
argument
that
can
be
invented
in
favor
of
royalty
by
the
most
ingenious
casuist
in
his
time
the
husband
of
this
princess
was
valuable
he
led
a
degraded
life
he
ended
it
with
his
own
hand
in
circumstances
and
surroundings
of
a
hideous
sort
and
was
buried
like
a
god
in
the
opera
house
there
is
a
long
loft
back
of
the
audience
a
kind
of
open
gallery
in
which
princes
are
displayed
it
is
sacred
to
them
it
is
the
holy
of
holies
as
soon
as
the
filling
of
the
house
is
about
complete
the
standing
multitude
turn
and
fix
their
eyes
upon
the
princely
layout
and
gaze
mutely
and
longingly
and
adoringly
and
regretfully
like
sinners
looking
into
heaven
they
become
rapt
unconscious
steeped
in
worship
there
is
no
spectacle
anywhere
that
is
more
pathetic
than
this
it
is
worth
crossing
many
oceans
to
see
it
is
somehow
not
the
same
gaze
that
people
rivet
upon
a
victor
hugo
or
niagara
or
the
bones
of
the
mastodon
or
the
guillotine
of
the
revolution
or
the
great
pyramid
or
distant
vesuvius
smoking
in
the
sky
or
any
man
long
celebrated
to
you
by
his
genius
and
achievements
or
thing
long
celebrated
to
you
by
the
praises
of
books
and
pictures
no
that
gaze
is
only
the
gaze
of
intense
curiosity
interest
wonder
engaged
in
drinking
delicious
deep
draughts
that
taste
good
all
the
way
down
and
appease
and
satisfy
the
thirst
of
a
lifetime
satisfy
it
that
is
the
word
hugo
and
the
mastodon
will
still
have
a
degree
of
intense
interest
thereafter
when
encountered
but
never
anything
approaching
the
ecstasy
of
that
first
view
the
interest
of
a
prince
is
different
it
may
be
envy
it
may
be
worship
doubtless
it
is
a
mixture
of
both
and
it
does
not
satisfy
its
thirst
with
one
view
or
even
noticeably
diminish
it
perhaps
the
essence
of
the
thing
is
the
value
which
men
attach
to
a
valuable
something
which
has
come
by
luck
and
not
been
earned
a
dollar
picked
up
in
the
road
is
more
satisfaction
to
you
than
the
ninety
and
nine
which
you
had
to
work
for
and
money
won
at
faro
or
in
stocks
snuggles
into
your
heart
in
the
same
way
a
prince
picks
up
grandeur
power
and
a
permanent
holiday
and
gratis
support
by
a
pure
accident
the
accident
of
birth
and
he
stands
always
before
the
grieved
eye
of
poverty
and
obscurity
a
monumental
representative
of
luck
and
then
supremest
value
of
all
his
is
the
only
high
fortune
on
the
earth
which
is
secure
the
commercial
millionaire
may
become
a
beggar
the
illustrious
statesman
can
make
a
vital
mistake
and
be
dropped
and
forgotten
the
illustrious
general
can
lose
a
decisive
battle
and
with
it
the
consideration
of
men
but
once
a
prince
always
a
prince
that
is
to
say
an
imitation
god
and
neither
hard
fortune
nor
an
infamous
character
nor
an
addled
brain
nor
the
speech
of
an
ass
can
undeify
him
by
common
consent
of
all
the
nations
and
all
the
ages
the
most
valuable
thing
in
this
world
is
the
homage
of
men
whether
deserved
or
undeserved
it
follows
without
doubt
or
question
then
that
the
most
desirable
position
possible
is
that
of
a
prince
and
i
think
it
also
follows
that
the
so
called
usurpations
with
which
history
is
littered
are
the
most
excusable
misdemeanors
which
men
have
committed
to
usurp
a
usurpation
that
is
all
it
amounts
to
isn't
it
a
prince
is
not
to
us
what
he
is
to
a
european
of
course
we
have
not
been
taught
to
regard
him
as
a
god
and
so
one
good
look
at
him
is
likely
to
so
nearly
appease
our
curiosity
as
to
make
him
an
object
of
no
greater
interest
the
next
time
we
want
a
fresh
one
but
it
is
not
so
with
the
european
i
am
quite
sure
of
it
the
same
old
one
will
answer
he
never
stales
eighteen
years
ago
i
was
in
london
and
i
called
at
an
englishman's
house
on
a
bleak
and
foggy
and
dismal
december
afternoon
to
visit
his
wife
and
married
daughter
by
appointment
i
waited
half
an
hour
and
then
they
arrived
frozen
they
explained
that
they
had
been
delayed
by
an
unlooked
for
circumstance
while
passing
in
the
neighborhood
of
marlborough
house
they
saw
a
crowd
gathering
and
were
told
that
the
prince
of
wales
was
about
to
drive
out
so
they
stopped
to
get
a
sight
of
him
they
had
waited
half
an
hour
on
the
sidewalk
freezing
with
the
crowd
but
were
disappointed
at
last
the
prince
had
changed
his
mind
i
said
with
a
good
deal
of
surprise
is
it
possible
that
you
two
have
lived
in
london
all
your
lives
and
have
never
seen
the
prince
of
wales
apparently
it
was
their
turn
to
be
surprised
for
they
exclaimed
what
an
idea
why
we
have
seen
him
hundreds
of
times
they
had
seen
him
hundreds
of
times
yet
they
had
waited
half
an
hour
in
the
gloom
and
the
bitter
cold
in
the
midst
of
a
jam
of
patients
from
the
same
asylum
on
the
chance
of
seeing
him
again
it
was
a
stupefying
statement
but
one
is
obliged
to
believe
the
english
even
when
they
say
a
thing
like
that
i
fumbled
around
for
a
remark
and
got
out
this
one
i
can't
understand
it
at
all
if
i
had
never
seen
general
grant
i
doubt
if
i
would
do
that
even
to
get
a
sight
of
him
with
a
slight
emphasis
on
the
last
word
their
blank
faces
showed
that
they
wondered
where
the
parallel
came
in
then
they
said
blankly
of
course
not
he
is
only
a
president
it
is
doubtless
a
fact
that
a
prince
is
a
permanent
interest
an
interest
not
subject
to
deterioration
the
general
who
was
never
defeated
the
general
who
never
held
a
council
of
war
the
only
general
who
ever
commanded
a
connected
battle
front
twelve
hundred
miles
long
the
smith
who
welded
together
the
broken
parts
of
a
great
republic
and
re
established
it
where
it
is
quite
likely
to
outlast
all
the
monarchies
present
and
to
come
was
really
a
person
of
no
serious
consequence
to
these
people
to
them
with
their
training
my
general
was
only
a
man
after
all
while
their
prince
was
clearly
much
more
than
that
a
being
of
a
wholly
unsimilar
construction
and
constitution
and
being
of
no
more
blood
and
kinship
with
men
than
are
the
serene
eternal
lights
of
the
firmament
with
the
poor
dull
tallow
candles
of
commerce
that
sputter
and
die
and
leave
nothing
behind
but
a
pinch
of
ashes
and
a
stink
i
saw
the
last
act
of
tannhauser
i
sat
in
the
gloom
and
the
deep
stillness
waiting
one
minute
two
minutes
i
do
not
know
exactly
how
long
then
the
soft
music
of
the
hidden
orchestra
began
to
breathe
its
rich
long
sighs
out
from
under
the
distant
stage
and
by
and
by
the
drop
curtain
parted
in
the
middle
and
was
drawn
softly
aside
disclosing
the
twilighted
wood
and
a
wayside
shrine
with
a
white
robed
girl
praying
and
a
man
standing
near
presently
that
noble
chorus
of
men's
voices
was
heard
approaching
and
from
that
moment
until
the
closing
of
the
curtain
it
was
music
just
music
music
to
make
one
drunk
with
pleasure
music
to
make
one
take
scrip
and
staff
and
beg
his
way
round
the
globe
to
hear
it
to
such
as
are
intending
to
come
here
in
the
wagner
season
next
year
i
wish
to
say
bring
your
dinner
pail
with
you
if
you
do
you
will
never
cease
to
be
thankful
if
you
do
not
you
will
find
it
a
hard
fight
to
save
yourself
from
famishing
in
bayreuth
bayreuth
is
merely
a
large
village
and
has
no
very
large
hotels
or
eating
houses
the
principal
inns
are
the
golden
anchor
and
the
sun
at
either
of
these
places
you
can
get
an
excellent
meal
no
i
mean
you
can
go
there
and
see
other
people
get
it
there
is
no
charge
for
this
the
town
is
littered
with
restaurants
but
they
are
small
and
bad
and
they
are
overdriven
with
custom
you
must
secure
a
table
hours
beforehand
and
often
when
you
arrive
you
will
find
somebody
occupying
it
we
have
had
this
experience
we
have
had
a
daily
scramble
for
life
and
when
i
say
we
i
include
shoals
of
people
i
have
the
impression
that
the
only
people
who
do
not
have
to
scramble
are
the
veterans
the
disciples
who
have
been
here
before
and
know
the
ropes
i
think
they
arrive
about
a
week
before
the
first
opera
and
engage
all
the
tables
for
the
season
my
tribe
had
tried
all
kinds
of
places
some
outside
of
the
town
a
mile
or
two
and
have
captured
only
nibblings
and
odds
and
ends
never
in
any
instance
a
complete
and
satisfying
meal
digestible
no
the
reverse
these
odds
and
ends
are
going
to
serve
as
souvenirs
of
bayreuth
and
in
that
regard
their
value
is
not
to
be
overestimated
photographs
fade
bric
a
brac
gets
lost
busts
of
wagner
get
broken
but
once
you
absorb
a
bayreuth
restaurant
meal
it
is
your
possession
and
your
property
until
the
time
comes
to
embalm
the
rest
of
you
some
of
these
pilgrims
here
become
in
effect
cabinets
cabinets
of
souvenirs
of
bayreuth
it
is
believed
among
scientists
that
you
could
examine
the
crop
of
a
dead
bayreuth
pilgrim
anywhere
in
the
earth
and
tell
where
he
came
from
but
i
like
this
ballast
i
think
a
hermitage
scrap
up
at
eight
in
the
evening
when
all
the
famine
breeders
have
been
there
and
laid
in
their
mementoes
and
gone
is
the
quietest
thing
you
can
lay
on
your
keelson
except
gravel
thursday
they
keep
two
teams
of
singers
in
stock
for
the
chief
roles
and
one
of
these
is
composed
of
the
most
renowned
artists
in
the
world
with
materna
and
alvary
in
the
lead
i
suppose
a
double
team
is
necessary
doubtless
a
single
team
would
die
of
exhaustion
in
a
week
for
all
the
plays
last
from
four
in
the
afternoon
till
ten
at
night
nearly
all
the
labor
falls
upon
the
half
dozen
head
singers
and
apparently
they
are
required
to
furnish
all
the
noise
they
can
for
the
money
if
they
feel
a
soft
whispery
mysterious
feeling
they
are
required
to
open
out
and
let
the
public
know
it
operas
are
given
only
on
sundays
mondays
wednesdays
and
thursdays
with
three
days
of
ostensible
rest
per
week
and
two
teams
to
do
the
four
operas
but
the
ostensible
rest
is
devoted
largely
to
rehearsing
it
is
said
that
the
off
days
are
devoted
to
rehearsing
from
some
time
in
the
morning
till
ten
at
night
are
there
two
orchestras
also
it
is
quite
likely
since
there
are
one
hundred
and
ten
names
in
the
orchestra
list
yesterday
the
opera
was
tristan
and
isolde
i
have
seen
all
sorts
of
audiences
at
theaters
operas
concerts
lectures
sermons
funerals
but
none
which
was
twin
to
the
wagner
audience
of
bayreuth
for
fixed
and
reverential
attention
absolute
attention
and
petrified
retention
to
the
end
of
an
act
of
the
attitude
assumed
at
the
beginning
of
it
you
detect
no
movement
in
the
solid
mass
of
heads
and
shoulders
you
seem
to
sit
with
the
dead
in
the
gloom
of
a
tomb
you
know
that
they
are
being
stirred
to
their
profoundest
depths
that
there
are
times
when
they
want
to
rise
and
wave
handkerchiefs
and
shout
their
approbation
and
times
when
tears
are
running
down
their
faces
and
it
would
be
a
relief
to
free
their
pent
emotions
in
sobs
or
screams
yet
you
hear
not
one
utterance
till
the
curtain
swings
together
and
the
closing
strains
have
slowly
faded
out
and
died
then
the
dead
rise
with
one
impulse
and
shake
the
building
with
their
applause
every
seat
is
full
in
the
first
act
there
is
not
a
vacant
one
in
the
last
if
a
man
would
be
conspicuous
let
him
come
here
and
retire
from
the
house
in
the
midst
of
an
act
it
would
make
him
celebrated
this
audience
reminds
me
of
nothing
i
have
ever
seen
and
of
nothing
i
have
read
about
except
the
city
in
the
arabian
tale
where
all
the
inhabitants
have
been
turned
to
brass
and
the
traveler
finds
them
after
centuries
mute
motionless
and
still
retaining
the
attitudes
which
they
last
knew
in
life
here
the
wagner
audience
dress
as
they
please
and
sit
in
the
dark
and
worship
in
silence
at
the
metropolitan
in
new
york
they
sit
in
a
glare
and
wear
their
showiest
harness
they
hum
airs
they
squeak
fans
they
titter
and
they
gabble
all
the
time
in
some
of
the
boxes
the
conversation
and
laughter
are
so
loud
as
to
divide
the
attention
of
the
house
with
the
stage
in
large
measure
the
metropolitan
is
a
show
case
for
rich
fashionables
who
are
not
trained
in
wagnerian
music
and
have
no
reverence
for
it
but
who
like
to
promote
art
and
show
their
clothes
can
that
be
an
agreeable
atmosphere
to
persons
in
whom
this
music
produces
a
sort
of
divine
ecstasy
and
to
whom
its
creator
is
a
very
deity
his
stage
a
temple
the
works
of
his
brain
and
hands
consecrated
things
and
the
partaking
of
them
with
eye
and
ear
a
sacred
solemnity
manifestly
no
then
perhaps
the
temporary
expatriation
the
tedious
traversing
of
seas
and
continents
the
pilgrimage
to
bayreuth
stands
explained
these
devotees
would
worship
in
an
atmosphere
of
devotion
it
is
only
here
that
they
can
find
it
without
fleck
or
blemish
or
any
worldly
pollution
in
this
remote
village
there
are
no
sights
to
see
there
is
no
newspaper
to
intrude
the
worries
of
the
distant
world
there
is
nothing
going
on
it
is
always
sunday
the
pilgrim
wends
to
his
temple
out
of
town
sits
out
his
moving
service
returns
to
his
bed
with
his
heart
and
soul
and
his
body
exhausted
by
long
hours
of
tremendous
emotion
and
he
is
in
no
fit
condition
to
do
anything
but
to
lie
torpid
and
slowly
gather
back
life
and
strength
for
the
next
service
this
opera
of
tristan
and
isolde
last
night
broke
the
hearts
of
all
witnesses
who
were
of
the
faith
and
i
know
of
some
who
have
heard
of
many
who
could
not
sleep
after
it
but
cried
the
night
away
i
feel
strongly
out
of
place
here
sometimes
i
feel
like
the
sane
person
in
a
community
of
the
mad
sometimes
i
feel
like
the
one
blind
man
where
all
others
see
the
one
groping
savage
in
the
college
of
the
learned
and
always
during
service
i
feel
like
a
heretic
in
heaven
but
by
no
means
do
i
ever
overlook
or
minify
the
fact
that
this
is
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
experiences
of
my
life
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
this
before
i
have
never
seen
anything
so
great
and
fine
and
real
as
this
devotion
friday
yesterday's
opera
was
parsifal
again
the
others
went
and
they
show
marked
advance
in
appreciation
but
i
went
hunting
for
relics
and
reminders
of
the
margravine
wilhelmina
she
of
the
imperishable
memoirs
i
am
properly
grateful
to
her
for
her
unconscious
satire
upon
monarchy
and
nobility
and
therefore
nothing
which
her
hand
touched
or
her
eye
looked
upon
is
indifferent
to
me
i
am
her
pilgrim
the
rest
of
this
multitude
here
are
wagner's
tuesday
i
have
seen
my
last
two
operas
my
season
is
ended
and
we
cross
over
into
bohemia
this
afternoon
i
was
supposing
that
my
musical
regeneration
was
accomplished
and
perfected
because
i
enjoyed
both
of
these
operas
singing
and
all
and
moreover
one
of
them
was
parsifal
but
the
experts
have
disenchanted
me
they
say
singing
that
wasn't
singing
that
was
the
wailing
screeching
of
third
rate
obscurities
palmed
off
on
us
in
the
interest
of
economy
well
i
ought
to
have
recognized
the
sign
the
old
sure
sign
that
has
never
failed
me
in
matters
of
art
whenever
i
enjoy
anything
in
art
it
means
that
it
is
mighty
poor
the
private
knowledge
of
this
fact
has
saved
me
from
going
to
pieces
with
enthusiasm
in
front
of
many
and
many
a
chromo
however
my
base
instinct
does
bring
me
profit
sometimes
i
was
the
only
man
out
of
thirty
two
hundred
who
got
his
money
back
on
those
two
operas
william
dean
howells
is
it
true
that
the
sun
of
a
man's
mentality
touches
noon
at
forty
and
then
begins
to
wane
toward
setting
doctor
osler
is
charged
with
saying
so
maybe
he
said
it
maybe
he
didn't
i
don't
know
which
it
is
but
if
he
said
it
i
can
point
him
to
a
case
which
proves
his
rule
proves
it
by
being
an
exception
to
it
to
this
place
i
nominate
mr
howells
i
read
his
venetian
days
about
forty
years
ago
i
compare
it
with
his
paper
on
machiavelli
in
a
late
number
of
harper
and
i
cannot
find
that
his
english
has
suffered
any
impairment
for
forty
years
his
english
has
been
to
me
a
continual
delight
and
astonishment
in
the
sustained
exhibition
of
certain
great
qualities
clearness
compression
verbal
exactness
and
unforced
and
seemingly
unconscious
felicity
of
phrasing
he
is
in
my
belief
without
his
peer
in
the
english
writing
world
sustained
i
entrench
myself
behind
that
protecting
word
there
are
others
who
exhibit
those
great
qualities
as
greatly
as
he
does
but
only
by
intervaled
distributions
of
rich
moonlight
with
stretches
of
veiled
and
dimmer
landscape
between
whereas
howells's
moon
sails
cloudless
skies
all
night
and
all
the
nights
in
the
matter
of
verbal
exactness
mr
howells
has
no
superior
i
suppose
he
seems
to
be
almost
always
able
to
find
that
elusive
and
shifty
grain
of
gold
the
right
word
others
have
to
put
up
with
approximations
more
or
less
frequently
he
has
better
luck
to
me
the
others
are
miners
working
with
the
gold
pan
of
necessity
some
of
the
gold
washes
over
and
escapes
whereas
in
my
fancy
he
is
quicksilver
raiding
down
a
riffle
no
grain
of
the
metal
stands
much
chance
of
eluding
him
a
powerful
agent
is
the
right
word
it
lights
the
reader's
way
and
makes
it
plain
a
close
approximation
to
it
will
answer
and
much
traveling
is
done
in
a
well
enough
fashion
by
its
help
but
we
do
not
welcome
it
and
applaud
it
and
rejoice
in
it
as
we
do
when
the
right
one
blazes
out
on
us
whenever
we
come
upon
one
of
those
intensely
right
words
in
a
book
or
a
newspaper
the
resulting
effect
is
physical
as
well
as
spiritual
and
electrically
prompt
it
tingles
exquisitely
around
through
the
walls
of
the
mouth
and
tastes
as
tart
and
crisp
and
good
as
the
autumn
butter
that
creams
the
sumac
berry
one
has
no
time
to
examine
the
word
and
vote
upon
its
rank
and
standing
the
automatic
recognition
of
its
supremacy
is
so
immediate
there
is
a
plenty
of
acceptable
literature
which
deals
largely
in
approximations
but
it
may
be
likened
to
a
fine
landscape
seen
through
the
rain
the
right
word
would
dismiss
the
rain
then
you
would
see
it
better
it
doesn't
rain
when
howells
is
at
work
and
where
does
he
get
the
easy
and
effortless
flow
of
his
speech
and
its
cadenced
and
undulating
rhythm
and
its
architectural
felicities
of
construction
its
graces
of
expression
its
pemmican
quality
of
compression
and
all
that
born
to
him
no
doubt
all
in
shining
good
order
in
the
beginning
all
extraordinary
and
all
just
as
shining
just
as
extraordinary
today
after
forty
years
of
diligent
wear
and
tear
and
use
he
passed
his
fortieth
year
long
and
long
ago
but
i
think
his
english
of
today
his
perfect
english
i
wish
to
say
can
throw
down
the
glove
before
his
english
of
that
antique
time
and
not
be
afraid
i
will
go
back
to
the
paper
on
machiavelli
now
and
ask
the
reader
to
examine
this
passage
from
it
which
i
append
i
do
not
mean
examine
it
in
a
bird's
eye
way
i
mean
search
it
study
it
and
of
course
read
it
aloud
i
may
be
wrong
still
it
is
my
conviction
that
one
cannot
get
out
of
finely
wrought
literature
all
that
is
in
it
by
reading
it
mutely
mr
dyer
is
rather
of
the
opinion
first
luminously
suggested
by
macaulay
that
machiavelli
was
in
earnest
but
must
not
be
judged
as
a
political
moralist
of
our
time
and
race
would
be
judged
he
thinks
that
machiavelli
was
in
earnest
as
none
but
an
idealist
can
be
and
he
is
the
first
to
imagine
him
an
idealist
immersed
in
realities
who
involuntarily
transmutes
the
events
under
his
eye
into
something
like
the
visionary
issues
of
reverie
the
machiavelli
whom
he
depicts
does
not
cease
to
be
politically
a
republican
and
socially
a
just
man
because
he
holds
up
an
atrocious
despot
like
caesar
borgia
as
a
mirror
for
rulers
what
machiavelli
beheld
round
him
in
italy
was
a
civic
disorder
in
which
there
was
oppression
without
statecraft
and
revolt
without
patriotism
when
a
miscreant
like
borgia
appeared
upon
the
scene
and
reduced
both
tyrants
and
rebels
to
an
apparent
quiescence
he
might
very
well
seem
to
such
a
dreamer
the
savior
of
society
whom
a
certain
sort
of
dreamers
are
always
looking
for
machiavelli
was
no
less
honest
when
he
honored
the
diabolical
force
of
caesar
borgia
than
carlyle
was
when
at
different
times
he
extolled
the
strong
man
who
destroys
liberty
in
creating
order
but
carlyle
has
only
just
ceased
to
be
mistaken
for
a
reformer
while
it
is
still
machiavelli's
hard
fate
to
be
so
trammeled
in
his
material
that
his
name
stands
for
whatever
is
most
malevolent
and
perfidious
in
human
nature
you
see
how
easy
and
flowing
it
is
how
unvexed
by
ruggednesses
clumsinesses
broken
meters
how
simple
and
so
far
as
you
or
i
can
make
out
unstudied
how
clear
how
limpid
how
understandable
how
unconfused
by
cross
currents
eddies
undertows
how
seemingly
unadorned
yet
is
all
adornment
like
the
lily
of
the
valley
and
how
compressed
how
compact
without
a
complacency
signal
hung
out
anywhere
to
call
attention
to
it
there
are
twenty
three
lines
in
the
quoted
passage
after
reading
it
several
times
aloud
one
perceives
that
a
good
deal
of
matter
is
crowded
into
that
small
space
i
think
it
is
a
model
of
compactness
when
i
take
its
materials
apart
and
work
them
over
and
put
them
together
in
my
way
i
find
i
cannot
crowd
the
result
back
into
the
same
hole
there
not
being
room
enough
i
find
it
a
case
of
a
woman
packing
a
man's
trunk
he
can
get
the
things
out
but
he
can't
ever
get
them
back
again
the
proffered
paragraph
is
a
just
and
fair
sample
the
rest
of
the
article
is
as
compact
as
it
is
there
are
no
waste
words
the
sample
is
just
in
other
ways
limpid
fluent
graceful
and
rhythmical
as
it
is
it
holds
no
superiority
in
these
respects
over
the
rest
of
the
essay
also
the
choice
phrasing
noticeable
in
the
sample
is
not
lonely
there
is
a
plenty
of
its
kin
distributed
through
the
other
paragraphs
this
is
claiming
much
when
that
kin
must
face
the
challenge
of
a
phrase
like
the
one
in
the
middle
sentence
an
idealist
immersed
in
realities
who
involuntarily
transmutes
the
events
under
his
eye
into
something
like
the
visionary
issues
of
reverie
with
a
hundred
words
to
do
it
with
the
literary
artisan
could
catch
that
airy
thought
and
tie
it
down
and
reduce
it
to
a
concrete
condition
visible
substantial
understandable
and
all
right
like
a
cabbage
but
the
artist
does
it
with
twenty
and
the
result
is
a
flower
the
quoted
phrase
like
a
thousand
others
that
have
come
from
the
same
source
has
the
quality
of
certain
scraps
of
verse
which
take
hold
of
us
and
stay
in
our
memories
we
do
not
understand
why
at
first
all
the
words
being
the
right
words
none
of
them
is
conspicuous
and
so
they
all
seem
inconspicuous
therefore
we
wonder
what
it
is
about
them
that
makes
their
message
take
hold
the
mossy
marbles
rest
on
the
lips
that
he
has
prest
in
their
bloom
and
the
names
he
loved
to
hear
have
been
carved
for
many
a
year
on
the
tomb
oliver
wendell
holmes
sr
it
is
like
a
dreamy
strain
of
moving
music
with
no
sharp
notes
in
it
the
words
are
all
right
words
and
all
the
same
size
we
do
not
notice
it
at
first
we
get
the
effect
it
goes
straight
home
to
us
but
we
do
not
know
why
it
is
when
the
right
words
are
conspicuous
that
they
thunder
the
glory
that
was
greece
and
the
grandeur
that
was
rome
when
i
go
back
from
howells
old
to
howells
young
i
find
him
arranging
and
clustering
english
words
well
but
not
any
better
than
now
he
is
not
more
felicitous
in
concreting
abstractions
now
than
he
was
in
translating
then
the
visions
of
the
eyes
of
flesh
into
words
that
reproduced
their
forms
and
colors
in
venetian
streets
they
give
the
fallen
snow
no
rest
it
is
at
once
shoveled
into
the
canals
by
hundreds
of
half
naked
facchini
and
now
in
st
mark's
place
the
music
of
innumerable
shovels
smote
upon
my
ear
and
i
saw
the
shivering
legion
of
poverty
as
it
engaged
the
elements
in
a
struggle
for
the
possession
of
the
piazza
but
the
snow
continued
to
fall
and
through
the
twilight
of
the
descending
flakes
all
this
toil
and
encounter
looked
like
that
weary
kind
of
effort
in
dreams
when
the
most
determined
industry
seems
only
to
renew
the
task
the
lofty
crest
of
the
bell
tower
was
hidden
in
the
folds
of
falling
snow
and
i
could
no
longer
see
the
golden
angel
upon
its
summit
but
looked
at
across
the
piazza
the
beautiful
outline
of
st
mark's
church
was
perfectly
penciled
in
the
air
and
the
shifting
threads
of
the
snowfall
were
woven
into
a
spell
of
novel
enchantment
around
the
structure
that
always
seemed
to
me
too
exquisite
in
its
fantastic
loveliness
to
be
anything
but
the
creation
of
magic
the
tender
snow
had
compassionated
the
beautiful
edifice
for
all
the
wrongs
of
time
and
so
hid
the
stains
and
ugliness
of
decay
that
it
looked
as
if
just
from
the
hand
of
the
builder
or
better
said
just
from
the
brain
of
the
architect
there
was
marvelous
freshness
in
the
colors
of
the
mosaics
in
the
great
arches
of
the
facade
and
all
that
gracious
harmony
into
which
the
temple
rises
of
marble
scrolls
and
leafy
exuberance
airily
supporting
the
statues
of
the
saints
was
a
hundred
times
etherealized
by
the
purity
and
whiteness
of
the
drifting
flakes
the
snow
lay
lightly
on
the
golden
globes
that
tremble
like
peacocks
crests
above
the
vast
domes
and
plumed
them
with
softest
white
it
robed
the
saints
in
ermine
and
it
danced
over
all
its
works
as
if
exulting
in
its
beauty
beauty
which
filled
me
with
subtle
selfish
yearning
to
keep
such
evanescent
loveliness
for
the
little
while
longer
of
my
whole
life
and
with
despair
to
think
that
even
the
poor
lifeless
shadow
of
it
could
never
be
fairly
reflected
in
picture
or
poem
through
the
wavering
snowfall
the
saint
theodore
upon
one
of
the
granite
pillars
of
the
piazzetta
did
not
show
so
grim
as
his
wont
is
and
the
winged
lion
on
the
other
might
have
been
a
winged
lamb
so
gentle
and
mild
he
looked
by
the
tender
light
of
the
storm
the
towers
of
the
island
churches
loomed
faint
and
far
away
in
the
dimness
the
sailors
in
the
rigging
of
the
ships
that
lay
in
the
basin
wrought
like
phantoms
among
the
shrouds
the
gondolas
stole
in
and
out
of
the
opaque
distance
more
noiselessly
and
dreamily
than
ever
and
a
silence
almost
palpable
lay
upon
the
mutest
city
in
the
world
the
spirit
of
venice
is
there
of
a
city
where
age
and
decay
fagged
with
distributing
damage
and
repulsiveness
among
the
other
cities
of
the
planet
in
accordance
with
the
policy
and
business
of
their
profession
come
for
rest
and
play
between
seasons
and
treat
themselves
to
the
luxury
and
relaxation
of
sinking
the
shop
and
inventing
and
squandering
charms
all
about
instead
of
abolishing
such
as
they
find
as
is
their
habit
when
not
on
vacation
in
the
working
season
they
do
business
in
boston
sometimes
and
a
character
in
the
undiscovered
country
takes
accurate
note
of
pathetic
effects
wrought
by
them
upon
the
aspects
of
a
street
of
once
dignified
and
elegant
homes
whose
occupants
have
moved
away
and
left
them
a
prey
to
neglect
and
gradual
ruin
and
progressive
degradation
a
descent
which
reaches
bottom
at
last
when
the
street
becomes
a
roost
for
humble
professionals
of
the
faith
cure
and
fortune
telling
sort
what
a
queer
melancholy
house
what
a
queer
melancholy
street
i
don't
think
i
was
ever
in
a
street
before
where
quite
so
many
professional
ladies
with
english
surnames
preferred
madam
to
mrs
on
their
door
plates
and
the
poor
old
place
has
such
a
desperately
conscious
air
of
going
to
the
deuce
every
house
seems
to
wince
as
you
go
by
and
button
itself
up
to
the
chin
for
fear
you
should
find
out
it
had
no
shirt
on
so
to
speak
i
don't
know
what's
the
reason
but
these
material
tokens
of
a
social
decay
afflict
me
terribly
a
tipsy
woman
isn't
dreadfuler
than
a
haggard
old
house
that's
once
been
a
home
in
a
street
like
this
mr
howells's
pictures
are
not
mere
stiff
hard
accurate
photographs
they
are
photographs
with
feeling
in
them
and
sentiment
photographs
taken
in
a
dream
one
might
say
as
concerns
his
humor
i
will
not
try
to
say
anything
yet
i
would
try
if
i
had
the
words
that
might
approximately
reach
up
to
its
high
place
i
do
not
think
any
one
else
can
play
with
humorous
fancies
so
gracefully
and
delicately
and
deliciously
as
he
does
nor
has
so
many
to
play
with
nor
can
come
so
near
making
them
look
as
if
they
were
doing
the
playing
themselves
and
he
was
not
aware
that
they
were
at
it
for
they
are
unobtrusive
and
quiet
in
their
ways
and
well
conducted
his
is
a
humor
which
flows
softly
all
around
about
and
over
and
through
the
mesh
of
the
page
pervasive
refreshing
health
giving
and
makes
no
more
show
and
no
more
noise
than
does
the
circulation
of
the
blood
there
is
another
thing
which
is
contentingly
noticeable
in
mr
howells's
books
that
is
his
stage
directions
those
artifices
which
authors
employ
to
throw
a
kind
of
human
naturalness
around
a
scene
and
a
conversation
and
help
the
reader
to
see
the
one
and
get
at
meanings
in
the
other
which
might
not
be
perceived
if
entrusted
unexplained
to
the
bare
words
of
the
talk
some
authors
overdo
the
stage
directions
they
elaborate
them
quite
beyond
necessity
they
spend
so
much
time
and
take
up
so
much
room
in
telling
us
how
a
person
said
a
thing
and
how
he
looked
and
acted
when
he
said
it
that
we
get
tired
and
vexed
and
wish
he
hadn't
said
it
at
all
other
authors
directions
are
brief
enough
but
it
is
seldom
that
the
brevity
contains
either
wit
or
information
writers
of
this
school
go
in
rags
in
the
matter
of
stage
directions
the
majority
of
them
having
nothing
in
stock
but
a
cigar
a
laugh
a
blush
and
a
bursting
into
tears
in
their
poverty
they
work
these
sorry
things
to
the
bone
they
say
replied
alfred
flipping
the
ash
from
his
cigar
this
explains
nothing
it
only
wastes
space
responded
richard
with
a
laugh
there
was
nothing
to
laugh
about
there
never
is
the
writer
puts
it
in
from
habit
automatically
he
is
paying
no
attention
to
his
work
or
he
would
see
that
there
is
nothing
to
laugh
at
often
when
a
remark
is
unusually
and
poignantly
flat
and
silly
he
tries
to
deceive
the
reader
by
enlarging
the
stage
direction
and
making
richard
break
into
frenzies
of
uncontrollable
laughter
this
makes
the
reader
sad
murmured
gladys
blushing
this
poor
old
shop
worn
blush
is
a
tiresome
thing
we
get
so
we
would
rather
gladys
would
fall
out
of
the
book
and
break
her
neck
than
do
it
again
she
is
always
doing
it
and
usually
irrelevantly
whenever
it
is
her
turn
to
murmur
she
hangs
out
her
blush
it
is
the
only
thing
she's
got
in
a
little
while
we
hate
her
just
as
we
do
richard
repeated
evelyn
bursting
into
tears
this
kind
keep
a
book
damp
all
the
time
they
can't
say
a
thing
without
crying
they
cry
so
much
about
nothing
that
by
and
by
when
they
have
something
to
cry
about
they
have
gone
dry
they
sob
and
fetch
nothing
we
are
not
moved
we
are
only
glad
they
garvel
me
these
stale
and
overworked
stage
directions
these
carbon
films
that
got
burnt
out
long
ago
and
cannot
now
carry
any
faintest
thread
of
light
it
would
be
well
if
they
could
be
relieved
from
duty
and
flung
out
in
the
literary
back
yard
to
rot
and
disappear
along
with
the
discarded
and
forgotten
steeds
and
halidomes
and
similar
stage
properties
once
so
dear
to
our
grandfathers
but
i
am
friendly
to
mr
howells's
stage
directions
more
friendly
to
them
than
to
any
one
else's
i
think
they
are
done
with
a
competent
and
discriminating
art
and
are
faithful
to
the
requirements
of
a
stage
direction's
proper
and
lawful
office
which
is
to
inform
sometimes
they
convey
a
scene
and
its
conditions
so
well
that
i
believe
i
could
see
the
scene
and
get
the
spirit
and
meaning
of
the
accompanying
dialogue
if
some
one
would
read
merely
the
stage
directions
to
me
and
leave
out
the
talk
for
instance
a
scene
like
this
from
the
undiscovered
country
and
she
laid
her
arms
with
a
beseeching
gesture
on
her
father's
shoulder
she
answered
following
his
gesture
with
a
glance
she
said
laughing
nervously
she
asked
turning
swiftly
upon
him
that
strange
searching
glance
she
answered
vaguely
she
reluctantly
admitted
but
her
voice
died
wearily
away
and
she
stood
looking
into
his
face
with
puzzled
entreaty
mr
howells
does
not
repeat
his
forms
and
does
not
need
to
he
can
invent
fresh
ones
without
limit
it
is
mainly
the
repetition
over
and
over
again
by
the
third
rates
of
worn
and
commonplace
and
juiceless
forms
that
makes
their
novels
such
a
weariness
and
vexation
to
us
i
think
we
do
not
mind
one
or
two
deliveries
of
their
wares
but
as
we
turn
the
pages
over
and
keep
on
meeting
them
we
presently
get
tired
of
them
and
wish
they
would
do
other
things
for
a
change
replied
alfred
flipping
the
ash
from
his
cigar
responded
richard
with
a
laugh
murmured
gladys
blushing
repeated
evelyn
bursting
into
tears
replied
the
earl
flipping
the
ash
from
his
cigar
responded
the
undertaker
with
a
laugh
murmured
the
chambermaid
blushing
repeated
the
burglar
bursting
into
tears
replied
the
conductor
flipping
the
ash
from
his
cigar
responded
arkwright
with
a
laugh
murmured
the
chief
of
police
blushing
repeated
the
house
cat
bursting
into
tears
and
so
on
and
so
on
till
at
last
it
ceases
to
excite
i
always
notice
stage
directions
because
they
fret
me
and
keep
me
trying
to
get
out
of
their
way
just
as
the
automobiles
do
at
first
then
by
and
by
they
become
monotonous
and
i
get
run
over
mr
howells
has
done
much
work
and
the
spirit
of
it
is
as
beautiful
as
the
make
of
it
i
have
held
him
in
admiration
and
affection
so
many
years
that
i
know
by
the
number
of
those
years
that
he
is
old
now
but
his
heart
isn't
nor
his
pen
and
years
do
not
count
let
him
have
plenty
of
them
there
is
profit
in
them
for
us
english
as
she
is
taught
in
the
appendix
to
croker's
boswell's
johnson
one
finds
this
anecdote
cato's
soliloquy
one
day
mrs
gastrel
set
a
little
girl
to
repeat
to
him
dr
samuel
johnson
cato's
soliloquy
which
she
went
through
very
correctly
the
doctor
after
a
pause
asked
the
child
what
was
to
bring
cato
to
an
end
she
said
it
was
a
knife
no
my
dear
it
was
not
so
my
aunt
polly
said
it
was
a
knife
why
aunt
polly's
knife
may
do
but
it
was
a
dagger
my
dear
he
then
asked
her
the
meaning
of
bane
and
antidote
which
she
was
unable
to
give
mrs
gastrel
said
you
cannot
expect
so
young
a
child
to
know
the
meaning
of
such
words
he
then
said
my
dear
how
many
pence
are
there
in
sixpence
i
cannot
tell
sir
was
the
half
terrified
reply
on
this
addressing
himself
to
mrs
gastrel
he
said
now
my
dear
lady
can
anything
be
more
ridiculous
than
to
teach
a
child
cato's
soliloquy
who
does
not
know
how
many
pence
there
are
in
sixpence
in
a
lecture
before
the
royal
geographical
society
professor
ravenstein
quoted
the
following
list
of
frantic
questions
and
said
that
they
had
been
asked
in
an
examination
mention
all
the
names
of
places
in
the
world
derived
from
julius
caesar
or
augustus
caesar
where
are
the
following
rivers
pisuerga
sakaria
guadalete
jalon
mulde
all
you
know
of
the
following
machacha
pilmo
schebulos
crivoscia
basecs
mancikert
taxhem
citeaux
meloria
zutphen
the
highest
peaks
of

karakorum

the

in
prussia
why
are
the
tops
of
mountains
continually
covered
with
snow
sic
name
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
streams
of
lava
which
issued
from
the
skaptar
jokul
in
the
eruption
of
that
list
would
oversize
nearly
anybody's
geographical
knowledge
isn't
it
reasonably
possible
that
in
our
schools
many
of
the
questions
in
all
studies
are
several
miles
ahead
of
where
the
pupil
is
that
he
is
set
to
struggle
with
things
that
are
ludicrously
beyond
his
present
reach
hopelessly
beyond
his
present
strength
this
remark
in
passing
and
by
way
of
text
now
i
come
to
what
i
was
going
to
say
i
have
just
now
fallen
upon
a
darling
literary
curiosity
it
is
a
little
book
a
manuscript
compilation
and
the
compiler
sent
it
to
me
with
the
request
that
i
say
whether
i
think
it
ought
to
be
published
or
not
i
said
yes
but
as
i
slowly
grow
wise
i
briskly
grow
cautious
and
so
now
that
the
publication
is
imminent
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
i
should
feel
more
comfortable
if
i
could
divide
up
this
responsibility
with
the
public
by
adding
them
to
the
court
therefore
i
will
print
some
extracts
from
the
book
in
the
hope
that
they
may
make
converts
to
my
judgment
that
the
volume
has
merit
which
entitles
it
to
publication
as
to
its
character
every
one
has
sampled
english
as
she
is
spoke
and
english
as
she
is
wrote
this
little
volume
furnishes
us
an
instructive
array
of
examples
of
english
as
she
is
taught
in
the
public
schools
of
well
this
country
the
collection
is
made
by
a
teacher
in
those
schools
and
all
the
examples
in
it
are
genuine
none
of
them
have
been
tampered
with
or
doctored
in
any
way
from
time
to
time
during
several
years
whenever
a
pupil
has
delivered
himself
of
anything
peculiarly
quaint
or
toothsome
in
the
course
of
his
recitations
this
teacher
and
her
associates
have
privately
set
that
thing
down
in
a
memorandum
book
strictly
following
the
original
as
to
grammar
construction
spelling
and
all
and
the
result
is
this
literary
curiosity
the
contents
of
the
book
consist
mainly
of
answers
given
by
the
boys
and
girls
to
questions
said
answers
being
given
sometimes
verbally
sometimes
in
writing
the
subjects
touched
upon
are
fifteen

you
perceive
that
the
poor
little
young
idea
has
taken
a
shot
at
a
good
many
kinds
of
game
in
the
course
of
the
book
now
as
to
results
here
are
some
quaint
definitions
of
words
it
will
be
noticed
that
in
all
of
these
instances
the
sound
of

it

yet
he

all
the
time
that
he
doesn't
here
is
an
odd
but
entirely
proper
use
of
a
word
and
a
most
sudden
descent
from
a
lofty
philosophical
altitude
to
a
very
practical
and
homely

we

endeavor

the
following
is
a
brave
attempt
at
a
solution
but
it
failed
to
liquify
when
they
are
going
to
say
some
prose
or
poetry
before
they
say
the
poetry
or
prose
they
must
put

this

the
questions

not

to
have
applied
the
microscope
to
the
subject
as
did
those
quoted
by
professor
ravenstein
still
they
proved
plenty
difficult
enough
without
that
these

did
not
hunt
with

they
hunted

the
chapter
headed
analysis
shows
us
that
the
pupils
in
our
public
schools
are
not
merely
loaded
up
with
those
showy
facts
about
geography
mathematics
and
so
on
and
left
in
that
incomplete
state
no
there's
machinery
for
clarifying
and
expanding
their
minds
they
are
required
to
take
poems
and
analyze
them
dig
out
their
common
sense
reduce
them
to
statistics
and
reproduce
them
in
a
luminous
prose
translation
which
shall
tell
you
at
a
glance
what
the
poet
was
trying
to
get
at
one
sample
will
do
here
is
a
stanza
from
the
lady
of
the
lake
followed
by
the
pupil's
impressive
explanation
of
it
alone
but
with
unbated
zeal
the
horseman
plied
with
scourge
and
steel
for
jaded
now
and
spent
with
toil
embossed
with
foam
and
dark
with
soil
while
every
gasp
with
sobs
he
drew
the
laboring
stag
strained
full
in
view
the
man
who
rode
on
the
horse
performed
the
whip
and
an
instrument
made
of
steel
alone
with
strong
ardor
not
diminishing
for
being
tired
from
the
time
passed
with
hard
labor
overworked
with
anger
and
ignorant
with
weariness
while
every
breath
for
labor
he
drew
with
cries
full
of
sorrow
the
young
deer
made
imperfect
who
worked
hard
filtered
in
sight
i
see
now
that
i
never
understood
that
poem
before
i
have
had
glimpses
of
its
meaning
in
moments
when
i
was
not
as
ignorant
with
weariness
as
usual
but
this
is
the
first
time
the
whole
spacious
idea
of
it
ever
filtered
in
sight
if
i
were
a
public
school
pupil
i
would
put
those
other
studies
aside
and
stick
to
analysis
for
after
all
it
is
the
thing
to
spread
your
mind
we
come
now
to
historical
matters
historical
remains
one
might
say
as
one
turns
the
pages
he
is
impressed
with
the
depth
to
which
one
date
has
been
driven
into
the
american
child's
head
the
date
is
there
and
it
is
there
to
stay
and
it
is
always
at
hand
always
deliverable
at
a
moment's
notice
but
the
fact
that
belongs
with
it
that
is
quite
another
matter
only
the
date
itself
is
familiar
and
sure
its
vast
fact
has
failed
of
lodgment
it
would
appear
that
whenever
you
ask
a
public
school
pupil
when
a
thing
anything
no
matter
what
happened
and
he
is
in
doubt
he
always
rips
out
his
he
applies
it
to
everything
from
the
landing
of
the
ark
to
the
introduction
of
the
horse
car
well
after
all
it
is
our
first
date
and
so
it
is
right
enough
to
honor
it
and
pay
the
public
schools
to
teach
our
children
to
honor
it

the
train
would
deafen
our
ears
so
that
we
couldn't
see
to
get
off
the
track
if
up
to
this
point
none
of
my
quotations
have
added
flavor
to
the
johnsonian
anecdote
at
the
head
of
this
article
let
us
make
another
attempt
the
theory
that
intuitive
truths
are
discovered
by
the
light
of
nature
originated
from
st
john's
interpretation
of
a
passage
in
the
gospel
of
plato
the
weight
of
the
earth
is
found
by
comparing
a
mass
of
known
lead
with
that
of
a
mass
of
unknown
lead
to
find
the
weight
of
the
earth
take
the
length
of
a
degree
on
a
meridian
and
multiply
by
pounds
the
spheres
are
to
each
other
as
the
squares
of
their
homologous
sides
a
body
will
go
just
as
far
in
the
first
second
as
the
body
will
go
plus
the
force
of
gravity
and
that's
equal
to
twice
what
the
body
will
go
specific
gravity
is
the
weight
to
be
compared
weight
of
an
equal
volume
of
or
that
is
the
weight
of
a
body
compared
with
the
weight
of
an
equal
volume
the
law
of
fluid
pressure
divide
the
different
forms
of
organized
bodies
by
the
form
of
attraction
and
the
number
increased
will
be
the
form
inertia
is
that
property
of
bodies
by
virtue
of
which
it
cannot
change
its
own
condition
of
rest
or
motion
in
other
words
it
is
the
negative
quality
of
passiveness
either
in
recoverable
latency
or
insipient
latescence
if
a
laugh
is
fair
here
not
the
struggling
child
nor
the
unintelligent
teacher
or
rather
the
unintelligent
boards
committees
and
trustees
are
the
proper
target
for
it
all
through
this
little
book
one
detects
the
signs
of
a
certain
probable
fact
that
a
large
part
of
the
pupil's
instruction
consists
in
cramming
him
with
obscure
and
wordy
rules
which
he
does
not
understand
and
has
no
time
to
understand
it
would
be
as
useful
to
cram
him
with
brickbats
they
would
at
least
stay
in
a
town
in
the
interior
of
new
york
a
few
years
ago
a
gentleman
set
forth
a
mathematical
problem
and
proposed
to
give
a
prize
to
every
public
school
pupil
who
should
furnish
the
correct
solution
of
it
twenty
two
of
the
brightest
boys
in
the
public
schools
entered
the
contest
the
problem
was
not
a
very
difficult
one
for
pupils
of
their
mathematical
rank
and
standing
yet
they
all
failed
by
a
hair
through
one
trifling
mistake
or
another
some
searching
questions
were
asked
when
it
turned
out
that
these
lads
were
as
glib
as
parrots
with
the
rules
but
could
not
reason
out
a
single
rule
or
explain
the
principle
underlying
it
their
memories
had
been
stocked
but
not
their
understandings
it
was
a
case
of
brickbat
culture
pure
and
simple
there
are
several
curious
compositions
in
the
little
book
and
we
must
make
room
for
one
it
is
full
of
naivete
brutal
truth
and
unembarrassed
directness
and
is
the
funniest
genuine
boy's
composition
i
think
i
have
ever
seen
on
girls
girls
are
very
stuck
up
and
dignefied
in
their
maner
and
be
have
your
they
think
more
of
dress
than
anything
and
like
to
play
with
dowls
and
rags
they
cry
if
they
see
a
cow
in
a
far
distance
and
are
afraid
of
guns
they
stay
at
home
all
the
time
and
go
to
church
on
sunday
they
are
al
ways
sick
they
are
always
funy
and
making
fun
of
boy's
hands
and
they
say
how
dirty
they
cant
play
marbels
i
pity
them
poor
things
they
make
fun
of
boys
and
then
turn
round
and
love
them
i
dont
beleave
they
ever
kiled
a
cat
or
anything
they
look
out
every
nite
and
say
oh
ant
the
moon
lovely
thir
is
one
thing
i
have
not
told
and
that
is
they
al
ways
now
their
lessons
bettern
boys
from
mr
edward
channing's
recent
article
in
science
the
marked
difference
between
the
books
now
being
produced
by
french
english
and
american
travelers
on
the
one
hand
and
german
explorers
on
the
other
is
too
great
to
escape
attention
that
difference
is
due
entirely
to
the
fact
that
in
school
and
university
the
german
is
taught
in
the
first
place
to
see
and
in
the
second
place
to
understand
what
he
does
see
a
simplified
alphabet
this
article
written
during
the
autumn
of
was
about
the
last
writing
done
by
mark
twain
on
any
impersonal
subject
i
have
had
a
kindly
feeling
a
friendly
feeling
a
cousinly
feeling
toward
simplified
spelling
from
the
beginning
of
the
movement
three
years
ago
but
nothing
more
inflamed
than
that
it
seemed
to
me
to
merely
propose
to
substitute
one
inadequacy
for
another
a
sort
of
patching
and
plugging
poor
old
dental
relics
with
cement
and
gold
and
porcelain
paste
what
was
really
wanted
was
a
new
set
of
teeth
that
is
to
say
a
new
alphabet
the
heart
of
our
trouble
is
with
our
foolish
alphabet
it
doesn't
know
how
to
spell
and
can't
be
taught
in
this
it
is
like
all
other
alphabets
except
one
the
phonographic
that
is
the
only
competent
alphabet
in
the
world
it
can
spell
and
correctly
pronounce
any
word
in
our
language
that
admirable
alphabet
that
brilliant
alphabet
that
inspired
alphabet
can
be
learned
in
an
hour
or
two
in
a
week
the
student
can
learn
to
write
it
with
some
little
facility
and
to
read
it
with
considerable
ease
i
know
for
i
saw
it
tried
in
a
public
school
in
nevada
forty
five
years
ago
and
was
so
impressed
by
the
incident
that
it
has
remained
in
my
memory
ever
since
i
wish
we
could
adopt
it
in
place
of
our
present
written
and
printed
character
i
mean
simply
the
alphabet
simply
the
consonants
and
the
vowels
i
don't
mean
any
reductions
or
abbreviations
of
them
such
as
the
shorthand
writer
uses
in
order
to
get
compression
and
speed
no
i
would
spell
every
word
out
i
will
insert
the
alphabet
here
as
i
find
it
in
burnz's
phonic
shorthand
figure
it
is
arranged
on
the
basis
of
isaac
pitman's
phonography
isaac
pitman
was
the
originator
and
father
of
scientific
phonography
it
is
used
throughout
the
globe
it
was
a
memorable
invention
he
made
it
public
seventy
three
years
ago
the
firm
of
isaac
pitman
sons
new
york
still
exists
and
they
continue
the
master's
work
what
should
we
gain
first
of
all
we
could
spell
definitely
and
correctly
any
word
you
please
just
by
the
sound
of
it
we
can't
do
that
with
our
present
alphabet
for
instance
take
a
simple
every
day
word
phthisis
if
we
tried
to
spell
it
by
the
sound
of
it
we
should
make
it
tysis
and
be
laughed
at
by
every
educated
person
secondly
we
should
gain
in
reduction
of
labor
in
writing
simplified
spelling
makes
valuable
reductions
in
the
case
of
several
hundred
words
but
the
new
spelling
must
be
learned
you
can't
spell
them
by
the
sound
you
must
get
them
out
of
the
book
but
even
if
we
knew
the
simplified
form
for
every
word
in
the
language
the
phonographic
alphabet
would
still
beat
the
simplified
speller
hands
down
in
the
important
matter
of
economy
of
labor
i
will
illustrate
present
form
through
laugh
highland

thru
laff
hyland
phonographic

figure
to
write
the

through
the
pen
has
to
make
twenty
one
strokes
to
write
the

thru
the

has
to
make
twelve

a
good
saving
to
write
that

word
with
the
phonographic

the
pen
has
to
make
only
three
strokes
to
write
the
word
laugh
the
pen
has
to
make
fourteen
strokes
to
write

the
pen
has
to
make
the

number
of

no
labor
is
saved
to
the

to
write
the

the

to

the
saving
in

is
insignificant
to
write
that
word
with
vowels
with
the
phonographic
alphabet
the
pen
has
to
make
only
seventeen
strokes
without
the
vowels
only
thirteen
strokes
figure
the
vowels
are
hardly
necessary
this
time
we
make
five
pen
strokes
in
writing
an
m
thus
figure
a
stroke
down
a
stroke
up
a
second
stroke
down
a
second
stroke
up
a
final
stroke
down
total
five
the
phonographic
alphabet
accomplishes
the
m
with
a
single
stroke
a
curve
like
a
parenthesis
that
has
come
home
drunk
and
has
fallen
face
down
right
at
the
front
door
where
everybody
that
goes
along
will
see
him
and
say
alas
when
our
written
m
is
not
the
end
of
a
word
but
is
otherwise
located
it
has
to
be
connected
with
the
next
letter
and
that
requires
another
pen
stroke
making
six
in
all
before
you
get
rid
of
that
m
but
never
mind
about
the
connecting
strokes
let
them
go
without
counting
them
the
twenty
six
letters
of
our
alphabet
consumed
about
eighty
pen
strokes
for
their
construction
about
three
pen
strokes
per
letter
it
is
three
times
the
number
required
by
the
phonographic
alphabet
it
requires
but
one
stroke
for
each
letter
my
writing
gait
is
well
i
don't
know
what
it
is
but
i
will
time
myself
and
see
result
it
is
twenty
four
words
per
minute
i
don't
mean
composing
i
mean
copying
there
isn't
any
definite
composing
gait
very
well
my
copying
gait
is
words
per
hour
say
if
i
could
use
the
phonographic
character
with
facility
i
could
do
the
in
twenty
minutes
i
could
do
nine
hours
copying
in
three
hours
i
could
do
three
years
copying
in
one
year
also
if
i
had
a
typewriting
machine
with
the
phonographic
alphabet
on
it
oh
the
miracles
i
could
do
i
am
not
pretending
to
write
that
character
well
i
have
never
had
a
lesson
and
i
am
copying
the
letters
from
the
book
but
i
can
accomplish
my
desire
at
any
rate
which
is
to
make
the
reader
get
a
good
and
clear
idea
of
the
advantage
it
would
be
to
us
if
we
could
discard
our
present
alphabet
and
put
this
better
one
in
its
place
using
it
in
books
newspapers
with
the
typewriter
and
with
the
pen
figure
man
dog
horse
i
think
it
is
graceful
and
would
look
comely
in
print
and
consider
once
more
i
beg
what
a
labor
saver
it
is
ten
pen
strokes
with
the
one
system
to
convey
those
three
words
above
and
thirty
three
by
the
other
figure
i
mean
in
some
ways
not
in
all
i
suppose
i
might
go
so
far
as
to
say
in
most
ways
and
be
within
the
facts
but
never
mind
let
it
go
at
some
one
of
the
ways
in
which
it
exercises
this
birthright
is
as
i
think
continuing
to
use
our
laughable
alphabet
these
seventy
three
years
while
there
was
a
rational
one
at
hand
to
be
had
for
the
taking
it
has
taken
five
hundred
years
to
simplify
some
of
chaucer's
rotten
spelling
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
use
so
frank
a
term
as
that
and
it
will
take
five
hundred
more
to
get
our
exasperating
new
simplified
corruptions
accepted
and
running
smoothly
and
we
sha'n't
be
any
better
off
then
than
we
are
now
for
in
that
day
we
shall
still
have
the
privilege
the
simplifiers
are
exercising
now
anybody
can
change
the
spelling
that
wants
to
but
you
can't
change
the
phonographic
spelling
there
isn't
any
way
it
will
always
follow
the
sound
if
you
want
to
change
the
spelling
you
have
to
change
the
sound
first
mind
i
myself
am
a
simplified
speller
i
belong
to
that
unhappy
guild
that
is
patiently
and
hopefully
trying
to
reform
our
drunken
old
alphabet
by
reducing
his
whiskey
well
it
will
improve
him
when
they
get
through
and
have
reformed
him
all
they
can
by
their
system
he
will
be
only
half
drunk
above
that
condition
their
system
can
never
lift
him
there
is
no
competent
and
lasting
and
real
reform
for
him
but
to
take
away
his
whiskey
entirely
and
fill
up
his
jug
with
pitman's
wholesome
and
undiseased
alphabet
one
great
drawback
to
simplified
spelling
is
that
in
print
a
simplified
word
looks
so
like
the
very
nation
and
when
you
bunch
a
whole
squadron
of
the
simplified
together
the
spectacle
is
very
nearly
unendurable
the
da
ma
ov
koars
kum
when
the
publik
ma
be
expektd
to
get
rekonsyled
to
the
bezair
asspekt
of
the
simplified
kombynashuns
but
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
is
it
worth
the
wasted
time
figure
to
see
our
letters
put
together
in
ways
to
which
we
are
not
accustomed
offends
the
eye
and
also
takes
the
expression
out
of
the
words
la
on
makduf
and
damd
be
he
hoo
furst
krys
hold
enuf
it
doesn't
thrill
you
as
it
used
to
do
the
simplifications
have
sucked
the
thrill
all
out
of
it
but
a
written
character
with
which
we
are
not
acquainted
does
not
offend
us
greek
hebrew
russian
arabic
and
the
others
they
have
an
interesting
look
and
we
see
beauty
in
them
too
and
this
is
true
of
hieroglyphics
as
well
there
is
something
pleasant
and
engaging
about
the
mathematical
signs
when
we
do
not
understand
them
the
mystery
hidden
in
these
things
has
a
fascination
for
us
we
can't
come
across
a
printed
page
of
shorthand
without
being
impressed
by
it
and
wishing
we
could
read
it
very
well
what
i
am
offering
for
acceptance
and
adoption
is
not
shorthand
but
longhand
written
with
the
shorthand
alphabet
unreduced
you
can
write
three
times
as
many
words
in
a
minute
with
it
as
you
can
write
with
our
alphabet
and
so
in
a
way
it
is
properly
a
shorthand
it
has
a
pleasant
look
too
a
beguiling
look
an
inviting
look
i
will
write
something
in
it
in
my
rude
and
untaught
way
figure
even
when
i
do
it
it
comes
out
prettier
than
it
does
in
simplified
spelling
yes
and
in
the
simplified
it
costs
one
hundred
and
twenty
three
pen
strokes
to
write
it
whereas
in
the
phonographic
it
costs
only
twenty
nine
figure
is
probably
figure
let
us
hope
so
anyway
as
concerns
interpreting
the
deity
i
this
line
of
hieroglyphs
was
for
fourteen
years
the
despair
of
all
the
scholars
who
labored
over
the
mysteries
of
the
rosetta
stone
figure
after
five
years
of
study
champollion
translated
it
thus
therefore
let
the
worship
of
epiphanes
be
maintained
in
all
the
temples
this
upon
pain
of
death
that
was
the
twenty
fourth
translation
that
had
been
furnished
by
scholars
for
a
time
it
stood
but
only
for
a
time
then
doubts
began
to
assail
it
and
undermine
it
and
the
scholars
resumed
their
labors
three
years
of
patient
work
produced
eleven
new
translations
among
them
this
by
grunfeldt
was
received
with
considerable
favor
the
horse
of
epiphanes
shall
be
maintained
at
the
public
expense
this
upon
pain
of
death
but
the
following
rendering
by
gospodin
was
received
by
the
learned
world
with
yet
greater
favor
the
priest
shall
explain
the
wisdom
of
epiphanes
to
all
these
people
and
these
shall
listen
with
reverence
upon
pain
of
death
seven
years
followed
in
which
twenty
one
fresh
and
widely
varying
renderings
were
scored
none
of
them
quite
convincing
but
now
at
last
came
rawlinson
the
youngest
of
all
the
scholars
with
a
translation
which
was
immediately
and
universally
recognized
as
being
the
correct
version
and
his
name
became
famous
in
a
day
so
famous
indeed
that
even
the
children
were
familiar
with
it
and
such
a
noise
did
the
achievement
itself
make
that
not
even
the
noise
of
the
monumental
political
event
of
that
same
year
the
flight
from
elba
was
able
to
smother
it
to
silence
rawlinson's
version
reads
as
follows
therefore
walk
not
away
from
the
wisdom
of
epiphanes
but
turn
and
follow
it
so
shall
it
conduct
thee
to
the
temple's
peace
and
soften
for
thee
the
sorrows
of
life
and
the
pains
of
death
here
is
another
difficult
text
figure
it
is
demotic
a
style
of
egyptian
writing
and
a
phase
of
the
language
which
had
perished
from
the
knowledge
of
all
men
twenty
five
hundred
years
before
the
christian
era
our
red
indians
have
left
many
records
in
the
form
of
pictures
upon
our
crags
and
boulders
it
has
taken
our
most
gifted
and
painstaking
students
two
centuries
to
get
at
the
meanings
hidden
in
these
pictures
yet
there
are
still
two
little
lines
of
hieroglyphics
among
the
figures
grouped
upon
the
dighton
rocks
which
they
have
not
succeeded
in
interpreting
to
their
satisfaction
these
figure
the
suggested
solutions
of
this
riddle
are
practically
innumerable
they
would
fill
a
book
thus
we
have
infinite
trouble
in
solving
man
made
mysteries
it
is
only
when
we
set
out
to
discover
the
secret
of
god
that
our
difficulties
disappear
it
was
always
so
in
antique
roman
times
it
was
the
custom
of
the
deity
to
try
to
conceal
his
intentions
in
the
entrails
of
birds
and
this
was
patiently
and
hopefully
continued
century
after
century
although
the
attempted
concealment
never
succeeded
in
a
single
recorded
instance
the
augurs
could
read
entrails
as
easily
as
a
modern
child
can
read
coarse
print
roman
history
is
full
of
the
marvels
of
interpretation
which
these
extraordinary
men
performed
these
strange
and
wonderful
achievements
move
our
awe
and
compel
our
admiration
those
men
could
pierce
to
the
marrow
of
a
mystery
instantly
if
the
rosetta
stone
idea
had
been
introduced
it
would
have
defeated
them
but
entrails
had
no
embarrassments
for
them
entrails
have
gone
out
now
entrails
and
dreams
it
was
at
last
found
out
that
as
hiding
places
for
the
divine
intentions
they
were
inadequate
a
part
of
the
wall
of
valletri
having
in
former
times
been
struck
with
thunder
the
response
of
the
soothsayers
was
that
a
native
of
that
town
would
some
time
or
other
arrive
at
supreme
power
bohn's
suetonius
p
some
time
or
other
it
looks
indefinite
but
no
matter
it
happened
all
the
same
one
needed
only
to
wait
and
be
patient
and
keep
watch
then
he
would
find
out
that
the
thunder
stroke
had
caesar
augustus
in
mind
and
had
come
to
give
notice
there
were
other
advance
advertisements
one
of
them
appeared
just
before
caesar
augustus
was
born
and
was
most
poetic
and
touching
and
romantic
in
its
feelings
and
aspects
it
was
a
dream
it
was
dreamed
by
caesar
augustus's
mother
and
interpreted
at
the
usual
rates
atia
before
her
delivery
dreamed
that
her
bowels
stretched
to
the
stars
and
expanded
through
the
whole
circuit
of
heaven
and
earth
suetonius
p
that
was
in
the
augur's
line
and
furnished
him
no
difficulties
but
it
would
have
taken
rawlinson
and
champollion
fourteen
years
to
make
sure
of
what
it
meant
because
they
would
have
been
surprised
and
dizzy
it
would
have
been
too
late
to
be
valuable
then
and
the
bill
for
service
would
have
been
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitation
in
those
old
roman
days
a
gentleman's
education
was
not
complete
until
he
had
taken
a
theological
course
at
the
seminary
and
learned
how
to
translate
entrails
caesar
augustus's
education
received
this
final
polish
all
through
his
life
whenever
he
had
poultry
on
the
menu
he
saved
the
interiors
and
kept
himself
informed
of
the
deity's
plans
by
exercising
upon
those
interiors
the
arts
of
augury
in
his
first
consulship
while
he
was
observing
the
auguries
twelve
vultures
presented
themselves
as
they
had
done
to
romulus
and
when
he
offered
sacrifice
the
livers
of
all
the
victims
were
folded
inward
in
the
lower
part
a
circumstance
which
was
regarded
by
those
present
who
had
skill
in
things
of
that
nature
as
an
indubitable
prognostic
of
great
and
wonderful
fortune
suetonius
p
indubitable
is
a
strong
word
but
no
doubt
it
was
justified
if
the
livers
were
really
turned
that
way
in
those
days
chicken
livers
were
strangely
and
delicately
sensitive
to
coming
events
no
matter
how
far
off
they
might
be
and
they
could
never
keep
still
but
would
curl
and
squirm
like
that
particularly
when
vultures
came
and
showed
interest
in
that
approaching
great
event
and
in
breakfast
ii
we
may
now
skip
eleven
hundred
and
thirty
or
forty
years
which
brings
us
down
to
enlightened
christian
times
and
the
troubled
days
of
king
stephen
of
england
the
augur
has
had
his
day
and
has
been
long
ago
forgotten
the
priest
had
fallen
heir
to
his
trade
king
henry
is
dead
stephen
that
bold
and
outrageous
person
comes
flying
over
from
normandy
to
steal
the
throne
from
henry's
daughter
he
accomplished
his
crime
and
henry
of
huntington
a
priest
of
high
degree
mourns
over
it
in
his
chronicle
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
consecrated
stephen
wherefore
the
lord
visited
the
archbishop
with
the
same
judgment
which
he
had
inflicted
upon
him
who
struck
jeremiah
the
great
priest
he
died
within
a
year
stephen's
was
the
greater
offense
but
stephen
could
wait
not
so
the
archbishop
apparently
the
kingdom
was
a
prey
to
intestine
wars
slaughter
fire
and
rapine
spread
ruin
throughout
the
land
cries
of
distress
horror
and
woe
rose
in
every
quarter
that
was
the
result
of
stephen's
crime
these
unspeakable
conditions
continued
during
nineteen
years
then
stephen
died
as
comfortably
as
any
man
ever
did
and
was
honorably
buried
it
makes
one
pity
the
poor
archbishop
and
wish
that
he
too
could
have
been
let
off
as
leniently
how
did
henry
of
huntington
know
that
the
archbishop
was
sent
to
his
grave
by
judgment
of
god
for
consecrating
stephen
he
does
not
explain
neither
does
he
explain
why
stephen
was
awarded
a
pleasanter
death
than
he
was
entitled
to
while
the
aged
king
henry
his
predecessor
who
had
ruled
england
thirty
five
years
to
the
people's
strongly
worded
satisfaction
was
condemned
to
close
his
life
in
circumstances
most
distinctly
unpleasant
inconvenient
and
disagreeable
his
was
probably
the
most
uninspiring
funeral
that
is
set
down
in
history
there
is
not
a
detail
about
it
that
is
attractive
it
seems
to
have
been
just
the
funeral
for
stephen
and
even
at
this
far
distant
day
it
is
matter
of
just
regret
that
by
an
indiscretion
the
wrong
man
got
it
whenever
god
punishes
a
man
henry
of
huntington
knows
why
it
was
done
and
tells
us
and
his
pen
is
eloquent
with
admiration
but
when
a
man
has
earned
punishment
and
escapes
he
does
not
explain
he
is
evidently
puzzled
but
he
does
not
say
anything
i
think
it
is
often
apparent
that
he
is
pained
by
these
discrepancies
but
loyally
tries
his
best
not
to
show
it
when
he
cannot
praise
he
delivers
himself
of
a
silence
so
marked
that
a
suspicious
person
could
mistake
it
for
suppressed
criticism
however
he
has
plenty
of
opportunities
to
feel
contented
with
the
way
things
go
his
book
is
full
of
them
king
david
of
scotland
under
color
of
religion
caused
his
followers
to
deal
most
barbarously
with
the
english
they
ripped
open
women
tossed
children
on
the
points
of
spears
butchered
priests
at
the
altars
and
cutting
off
the
heads
from
the
images
on
crucifixes
placed
them
on
the
bodies
of
the
slain
while
in
exchange
they
fixed
on
the
crucifixes
the
heads
of
their
victims
wherever
the
scots
came
there
was
the
same
scene
of
horror
and
cruelty
women
shrieking
old
men
lamenting
amid
the
groans
of
the
dying
and
the
despair
of
the
living
but
the
english
got
the
victory
then
the
chief
of
the
men
of
lothian
fell
pierced
by
an
arrow
and
all
his
followers
were
put
to
flight
for
the
almighty
was
offended
at
them
and
their
strength
was
rent
like
a
cobweb
offended
at
them
for
what
for
committing
those
fearful
butcheries
no
for
that
was
the
common
custom
on
both
sides
and
not
open
to
criticism
then
was
it
for
doing
the
butcheries
under
cover
of
religion
no
that
was
not
it
religious
feeling
was
often
expressed
in
that
fervent
way
all
through
those
old
centuries
the
truth
is
he
was
not
offended
at
them
at
all
he
was
only
offended
at
their
king
who
had
been
false
to
an
oath
then
why
did
not
he
put
the
punishment
upon
the
king
instead
of
upon
them
it
is
a
difficult
question
one
can
see
by
the
chronicle
that
the
judgments
fell
rather
customarily
upon
the
wrong
person
but
henry
of
huntington
does
not
explain
why
here
is
one
that
went
true
the
chronicler's
satisfaction
in
it
is
not
hidden
in
the
month
of
august
providence
displayed
its
justice
in
a
remarkable
manner
for
two
of
the
nobles
who
had
converted
monasteries
into
fortifications
expelling
the
monks
their
sin
being
the
same
met
with
a
similar
punishment
robert
marmion
was
one
godfrey
de
mandeville
the
other
robert
marmion
issuing
forth
against
the
enemy
was
slain
under
the
walls
of
the
monastery
being
the
only
one
who
fell
though
he
was
surrounded
by
his
troops
dying
excommunicated
he
became
subject
to
death
everlasting
in
like
manner
earl
godfrey
was
singled
out
among
his
followers
and
shot
with
an
arrow
by
a
common
foot
soldier
he
made
light
of
the
wound
but
he
died
of
it
in
a
few
days
under
excommunication
see
here
the
like
judgment
of
god
memorable
through
all
ages
this
exaltation
jars
upon
me
not
because
of
the
death
of
the
men
for
they
deserved
that
but
because
it
is
death
eternal
in
white
hot
fire
and
flame
it
makes
my
flesh
crawl
i
have
not
known
more
than
three
men
or
perhaps
four
in
my
whole
lifetime
whom
i
would
rejoice
to
see
writhing
in
those
fires
for
even
a
year
let
alone
forever
i
believe
i
would
relent
before
the
year
was
up
and
get
them
out
if
i
could
i
think
that
in
the
long
run
if
a
man's
wife
and
babies
who
had
not
harmed
me
should
come
crying
and
pleading
i
couldn't
stand
it
i
know
i
should
forgive
him
and
let
him
go
even
if
he
had
violated
a
monastery
henry
of
huntington
has
been
watching
godfrey
and
marmion
for
nearly
seven
hundred
and
fifty
years
now
but
i
couldn't
do
it
i
know
i
couldn't
i
am
soft
and
gentle
in
my
nature
and
i
should
have
forgiven
them
seventy
and
seven
times
long
ago
and
i
think
god
has
but
this
is
only
an
opinion
and
not
authoritative
like
henry
of
huntington's
interpretations
i
could
learn
to
interpret
but
i
have
never
tried
i
get
so
little
time
all
through
his
book
henry
exhibits
his
familiarity
with
the
intentions
of
god
and
with
the
reasons
for
his
intentions
sometimes
very
often
in
fact
the
act
follows
the
intention
after
such
a
wide
interval
of
time
that
one
wonders
how
henry
could
fit
one
act
out
of
a
hundred
to
one
intention
out
of
a
hundred
and
get
the
thing
right
every
time
when
there
was
such
abundant
choice
among
acts
and
intentions
sometimes
a
man
offends
the
deity
with
a
crime
and
is
punished
for
it
thirty
years
later
meantime
he
has
committed
a
million
other
crimes
no
matter
henry
can
pick
out
the
one
that
brought
the
worms
worms
were
generally
used
in
those
days
for
the
slaying
of
particularly
wicked
people
this
has
gone
out
now
but
in
old
times
it
was
a
favorite
it
always
indicated
a
case
of
wrath
for
instance
the
just
god
avenging
robert
fitzhilderbrand's
perfidy
a
worm
grew
in
his
vitals
which
gradually
gnawing
its
way
through
his
intestines
fattened
on
the
abandoned
man
till
tortured
with
excruciating
sufferings
and
venting
himself
in
bitter
moans
he
was
by
a
fitting
punishment
brought
to
his
end
p
it
was
probably
an
alligator
but
we
cannot
tell
we
only
know
it
was
a
particular
breed
and
only
used
to
convey
wrath
some
authorities
think
it
was
an
ichthyosaurus
but
there
is
much
doubt
however
one
thing
we
do
know
and
that
is
that
that
worm
had
been
due
years
and
years
robert
f
had
violated
a
monastery
once
he
had
committed
unprintable
crimes
since
and
they
had
been
permitted
under
disapproval
but
the
ravishment
of
the
monastery
had
not
been
forgotten
nor
forgiven
and
the
worm
came
at
last
why
were
these
reforms
put
off
in
this
strange
way
what
was
to
be
gained
by
it
did
henry
of
huntington
really
know
his
facts
or
was
he
only
guessing
sometimes
i
am
half
persuaded
that
he
is
only
a
guesser
and
not
a
good
one
the
divine
wisdom
must
surely
be
of
the
better
quality
than
he
makes
it
out
to
be
five
hundred
years
before
henry's
time
some
forecasts
of
the
lord's
purposes
were
furnished
by
a
pope
who
perceived
by
certain
perfectly
trustworthy
signs
furnished
by
the
deity
for
the
information
of
his
familiars
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
about
to
come
but
as
this
end
of
the
world
draws
near
many
things
are
at
hand
which
have
not
before
happened
as
changes
in
the
air
terrible
signs
in
the
heavens
tempests
out
of
the
common
order
of
the
seasons
wars
famines
pestilences
earthquakes
in
various
places
all
which
will
not
happen
in
our
days
but
after
our
days
all
will
come
to
pass
still
the
end
was
so
near
that
these
signs
were
sent
before
that
we
may
be
careful
for
our
souls
and
be
found
prepared
to
meet
the
impending
judgment
that
was
thirteen
hundred
years
ago
this
is
really
no
improvement
on
the
work
of
the
roman
augurs
concerning
tobacco
written
about
not
before
published
as
concerns
tobacco
there
are
many
superstitions
and
the
chiefest
is
this
that
there
is
a
standard
governing
the
matter
whereas
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
each
man's
own
preference
is
the
only
standard
for
him
the
only
one
which
he
can
accept
the
only
one
which
can
command
him
a
congress
of
all
the
tobacco
lovers
in
the
world
could
not
elect
a
standard
which
would
be
binding
upon
you
or
me
or
would
even
much
influence
us
the
next
superstition
is
that
a
man
has
a
standard
of
his
own
he
hasn't
he
thinks
he
has
but
he
hasn't
he
thinks
he
can
tell
what
he
regards
as
a
good
cigar
from
what
he
regards
as
a
bad
one
but
he
can't
he
goes
by
the
brand
yet
imagines
he
goes
by
the
flavor
one
may
palm
off
the
worst
counterfeit
upon
him
if
it
bears
his
brand
he
will
smoke
it
contentedly
and
never
suspect
children
of
twenty
five
who
have
seven
years
of
experience
try
to
tell
me
what
is
a
good
cigar
and
what
isn't
me
who
never
learned
to
smoke
but
always
smoked
me
who
came
into
the
world
asking
for
a
light
no
one
can
tell
me
what
is
a
good
cigar
for
me
i
am
the
only
judge
people
who
claim
to
know
say
that
i
smoke
the
worst
cigars
in
the
world
they
bring
their
own
cigars
when
they
come
to
my
house
they
betray
an
unmanly
terror
when
i
offer
them
a
cigar
they
tell
lies
and
hurry
away
to
meet
engagements
which
they
have
not
made
when
they
are
threatened
with
the
hospitalities
of
my
box
now
then
observe
what
superstition
assisted
by
a
man's
reputation
can
do
i
was
to
have
twelve
personal
friends
to
supper
one
night
one
of
them
was
as
notorious
for
costly
and
elegant
cigars
as
i
was
for
cheap
and
devilish
ones
i
called
at
his
house
and
when
no
one
was
looking
borrowed
a
double
handful
of
his
very
choicest
cigars
which
cost
him
forty
cents
apiece
and
bore
red
and
gold
labels
in
sign
of
their
nobility
i
removed
the
labels
and
put
the
cigars
into
a
box
with
my
favorite
brand
on
it
a
brand
which
those
people
all
knew
and
which
cowed
them
as
men
are
cowed
by
an
epidemic
they
took
these
cigars
when
offered
at
the
end
of
the
supper
and
lit
them
and
sternly
struggled
with
them
in
dreary
silence
for
hilarity
died
when
the
fell
brand
came
into
view
and
started
around
but
their
fortitude
held
for
a
short
time
only
then
they
made
excuses
and
filed
out
treading
on
one
another's
heels
with
indecent
eagerness
and
in
the
morning
when
i
went
out
to
observe
results
the
cigars
lay
all
between
the
front
door
and
the
gate
all
except
one
that
one
lay
in
the
plate
of
the
man
from
whom
i
had
cabbaged
the
lot
one
or
two
whiffs
was
all
he
could
stand
he
told
me
afterward
that
some
day
i
would
get
shot
for
giving
people
that
kind
of
cigars
to
smoke
am
i
certain
of
my
own
standard
perfectly
yes
absolutely
unless
somebody
fools
me
by
putting
my
brand
on
some
other
kind
of
cigar
for
no
doubt
i
am
like
the
rest
and
know
my
cigar
by
the
brand
instead
of
by
the
flavor
however
my
standard
is
a
pretty
wide
one
and
covers
a
good
deal
of
territory
to
me
almost
any
cigar
is
good
that
nobody
else
will
smoke
and
to
me
almost
all
cigars
are
bad
that
other
people
consider
good
nearly
any
cigar
will
do
me
except
a
havana
people
think
they
hurt
my
feelings
when
they
come
to
my
house
with
their
life
preservers
on
i
mean
with
their
own
cigars
in
their
pockets
it
is
an
error
i
take
care
of
myself
in
a
similar
way
when
i
go
into
danger
that
is
into
rich
people's
houses
where
in
the
nature
of
things
they
will
have
high
tariff
cigars
red
and
gilt
girded
and
nested
in
a
rosewood
box
along
with
a
damp
sponge
cigars
which
develop
a
dismal
black
ash
and
burn
down
the
side
and
smell
and
will
grow
hot
to
the
fingers
and
will
go
on
growing
hotter
and
hotter
and
go
on
smelling
more
and
more
infamously
and
unendurably
the
deeper
the
fire
tunnels
down
inside
below
the
thimbleful
of
honest
tobacco
that
is
in
the
front
end
the
furnisher
of
it
praising
it
all
the
time
and
telling
you
how
much
the
deadly
thing
cost
yes
when
i
go
into
that
sort
of
peril
i
carry
my
own
defense
along
i
carry
my
own
brand
twenty
seven
cents
a
barrel
and
i
live
to
see
my
family
again
i
may
seem
to
light
his
red
gartered
cigar
but
that
is
only
for
courtesy's
sake
i
smuggle
it
into
my
pocket
for
the
poor
of
whom
i
know
many
and
light
one
of
my
own
and
while
he
praises
it
i
join
in
but
when
he
says
it
cost
forty
five
cents
i
say
nothing
for
i
know
better
however
to
say
true
my
tastes
are
so
catholic
that
i
have
never
seen
any
cigars
that
i
really
could
not
smoke
except
those
that
cost
a
dollar
apiece
i
have
examined
those
and
know
that
they
are
made
of
dog
hair
and
not
good
dog
hair
at
that
i
have
a
thoroughly
satisfactory
time
in
europe
for
all
over
the
continent
one
finds
cigars
which
not
even
the
most
hardened
newsboys
in
new
york
would
smoke
i
brought
cigars
with
me
the
last
time
i
will
not
do
that
any
more
in
italy
as
in
france
the
government
is
the
only
cigar
peddler
italy
has
three
or
four
domestic
brands
the
minghetti
the
trabuco
the
virginia
and
a
very
coarse
one
which
is
a
modification
of
the
virginia
the
minghettis
are
large
and
comely
and
cost
three
dollars
and
sixty
cents
a
hundred
i
can
smoke
a
hundred
in
seven
days
and
enjoy
every
one
of
them
the
trabucos
suit
me
too
i
don't
remember
the
price
but
one
has
to
learn
to
like
the
virginia
nobody
is
born
friendly
to
it
it
looks
like
a
rat
tail
file
but
smokes
better
some
think
it
has
a
straw
through
it
you
pull
this
out
and
it
leaves
a
flue
otherwise
there
would
be
no
draught
not
even
as
much
as
there
is
to
a
nail
some
prefer
a
nail
at
first
however
i
like
all
the
french
swiss
german
and
italian
domestic
cigars
and
have
never
cared
to
inquire
what
they
are
made
of
and
nobody
would
know
anyhow
perhaps
there
is
even
a
brand
of
european
smoking
tobacco
that
i
like
it
is
a
brand
used
by
the
italian
peasants
it
is
loose
and
dry
and
black
and
looks
like
tea
grounds
when
the
fire
is
applied
it
expands
and
climbs
up
and
towers
above
the
pipe
and
presently
tumbles
off
inside
of
one's
vest
the
tobacco
itself
is
cheap
but
it
raises
the
insurance
it
is
as
i
remarked
in
the
beginning
the
taste
for
tobacco
is
a
matter
of
superstition
there
are
no
standards
no
real
standards
each
man's
preference
is
the
only
standard
for
him
the
only
one
which
he
can
accept
the
only
one
which
can
command
him
the
bee
it
was
maeterlinck
who
introduced
me
to
the
bee
i
mean
in
the
psychical
and
in
the
poetical
way
i
had
had
a
business
introduction
earlier
it
was
when
i
was
a
boy
it
is
strange
that
i
should
remember
a
formality
like
that
so
long
it
must
be
nearly
sixty
years
bee
scientists
always
speak
of
the
bee
as
she
it
is
because
all
the
important
bees
are
of
that
sex
in
the
hive
there
is
one
married
bee
called
the
queen
she
has
fifty
thousand
children
of
these
about
one
hundred
are
sons
the
rest
are
daughters
some
of
the
daughters
are
young
maids
some
are
old
maids
and
all
are
virgins
and
remain
so
every
spring
the
queen
comes
out
of
the
hive
and
flies
away
with
one
of
her
sons
and
marries
him
the
honeymoon
lasts
only
an
hour
or
two
then
the
queen
divorces
her
husband
and
returns
home
competent
to
lay
two
million
eggs
this
will
be
enough
to
last
the
year
but
not
more
than
enough
because
hundreds
of
bees
get
drowned
every
day
and
other
hundreds
are
eaten
by
birds
and
it
is
the
queen's
business
to
keep
the
population
up
to
standard
say
fifty
thousand
she
must
always
have
that
many
children
on
hand
and
efficient
during
the
busy
season
which
is
summer
or
winter
would
catch
the
community
short
of
food
she
lays
from
two
thousand
to
three
thousand
eggs
a
day
according
to
the
demand
and
she
must
exercise
judgment
and
not
lay
more
than
are
needed
in
a
slim
flower
harvest
nor
fewer
than
are
required
in
a
prodigal
one
or
the
board
of
directors
will
dethrone
her
and
elect
a
queen
that
has
more
sense
there
are
always
a
few
royal
heirs
in
stock
and
ready
to
take
her
place
ready
and
more
than
anxious
to
do
it
although
she
is
their
own
mother
these
girls
are
kept
by
themselves
and
are
regally
fed
and
tended
from
birth
no
other
bees
get
such
fine
food
as
they
get
or
live
such
a
high
and
luxurious
life
by
consequence
they
are
larger
and
longer
and
sleeker
than
their
working
sisters
and
they
have
a
curved
sting
shaped
like
a
scimitar
while
the
others
have
a
straight
one
a
common
bee
will
sting
any
one
or
anybody
but
a
royalty
stings
royalties
only
a
common
bee
will
sting
and
kill
another
common
bee
for
cause
but
when
it
is
necessary
to
kill
the
queen
other
ways
are
employed
when
a
queen
has
grown
old
and
slack
and
does
not
lay
eggs
enough
one
of
her
royal
daughters
is
allowed
to
come
to
attack
her
the
rest
of
the
bees
looking
on
at
the
duel
and
seeing
fair
play
it
is
a
duel
with
the
curved
stings
if
one
of
the
fighters
gets
hard
pressed
and
gives
it
up
and
runs
she
is
brought
back
and
must
try
again
once
maybe
twice
then
if
she
runs
yet
once
more
for
her
life
judicial
death
is
her
portion
her
children
pack
themselves
into
a
ball
around
her
person
and
hold
her
in
that
compact
grip
two
or
three
days
until
she
starves
to
death
or
is
suffocated
meantime
the
victor
bee
is
receiving
royal
honors
and
performing
the
one
royal
function
laying
eggs
as
regards
the
ethics
of
the
judicial
assassination
of
the
queen
that
is
a
matter
of
politics
and
will
be
discussed
later
in
its
proper
place
during
substantially
the
whole
of
her
short
life
of
five
or
six
years
the
queen
lives
in
the
egyptian
darkness
and
stately
seclusion
of
the
royal
apartments
with
none
about
her
but
plebeian
servants
who
give
her
empty
lip
affection
in
place
of
the
love
which
her
heart
hungers
for
who
spy
upon
her
in
the
interest
of
her
waiting
heirs
and
report
and
exaggerate
her
defects
and
deficiencies
to
them
who
fawn
upon
her
and
flatter
her
to
her
face
and
slander
her
behind
her
back
who
grovel
before
her
in
the
day
of
her
power
and
forsake
her
in
her
age
and
weakness
there
she
sits
friendless
upon
her
throne
through
the
long
night
of
her
life
cut
off
from
the
consoling
sympathies
and
sweet
companionship
and
loving
endearments
which
she
craves
by
the
gilded
barriers
of
her
awful
rank
a
forlorn
exile
in
her
own
house
and
home
weary
object
of
formal
ceremonies
and
machine
made
worship
winged
child
of
the
sun
native
to
the
free
air
and
the
blue
skies
and
the
flowery
fields
doomed
by
the
splendid
accident
of
her
birth
to
trade
this
priceless
heritage
for
a
black
captivity
a
tinsel
grandeur
and
a
loveless
life
with
shame
and
insult
at
the
end
and
a
cruel
death
and
condemned
by
the
human
instinct
in
her
to
hold
the
bargain
valuable
huber
lubbock
maeterlinck
in
fact
all
the
great
authorities
are
agreed
in
denying
that
the
bee
is
a
member
of
the
human
family
i
do
not
know
why
they
have
done
this
but
i
think
it
is
from
dishonest
motives
why
the
innumerable
facts
brought
to
light
by
their
own
painstaking
and
exhaustive
experiments
prove
that
if
there
is
a
master
fool
in
the
world
it
is
the
bee
that
seems
to
settle
it
but
that
is
the
way
of
the
scientist
he
will
spend
thirty
years
in
building
up
a
mountain
range
of
facts
with
the
intent
to
prove
a
certain
theory
then
he
is
so
happy
in
his
achievement
that
as
a
rule
he
overlooks
the
main
chief
fact
of
all
that
his
accumulation
proves
an
entirely
different
thing
when
you
point
out
this
miscarriage
to
him
he
does
not
answer
your
letters
when
you
call
to
convince
him
the
servant
prevaricates
and
you
do
not
get
in
scientists
have
odious
manners
except
when
you
prop
up
their
theory
then
you
can
borrow
money
of
them
to
be
strictly
fair
i
will
concede
that
now
and
then
one
of
them
will
answer
your
letter
but
when
they
do
they
avoid
the
issue
you
cannot
pin
them
down
when
i
discovered
that
the
bee
was
human
i
wrote
about
it
to
all
those
scientists
whom
i
have
just
mentioned
for
evasions
i
have
seen
nothing
to
equal
the
answers
i
got
after
the
queen
the
personage
next
in
importance
in
the
hive
is
the
virgin
the
virgins
are
fifty
thousand
or
one
hundred
thousand
in
number
and
they
are
the
workers
the
laborers
no
work
is
done
in
the
hive
or
out
of
it
save
by
them
the
males
do
not
work
the
queen
does
no
work
unless
laying
eggs
is
work
but
it
does
not
seem
so
to
me
there
are
only
two
million
of
them
anyway
and
all
of
five
months
to
finish
the
contract
in
the
distribution
of
work
in
a
hive
is
as
cleverly
and
elaborately
specialized
as
it
is
in
a
vast
american
machine
shop
or
factory
a
bee
that
has
been
trained
to
one
of
the
many
and
various
industries
of
the
concern
doesn't
know
how
to
exercise
any
other
and
would
be
offended
if
asked
to
take
a
hand
in
anything
outside
of
her
profession
she
is
as
human
as
a
cook
and
if
you
should
ask
the
cook
to
wait
on
the
table
you
know
what
would
happen
cooks
will
play
the
piano
if
you
like
but
they
draw
the
line
there
in
my
time
i
have
asked
a
cook
to
chop
wood
and
i
know
about
these
things
even
the
hired
girl
has
her
frontiers
true
they
are
vague
they
are
ill
defined
even
flexible
but
they
are
there
this
is
not
conjecture
it
is
founded
on
the
absolute
and
then
the
butler
you
ask
the
butler
to
wash
the
dog
it
is
just
as
i
say
there
is
much
to
be
learned
in
these
ways
without
going
to
books
books
are
very
well
but
books
do
not
cover
the
whole
domain
of
esthetic
human
culture
pride
of
profession
is
one
of
the
boniest
bones
in
existence
if
not
the
boniest
without
doubt
it
is
so
in
the
hive
taming
the
bicycle
written
about
not
before
published
in
the
early
eighties
mark
twain
learned
to
ride
one
of
the
old
high
wheel
bicycles
of
that
period
he
wrote
an
account
of
his
experience
but
did
not
offer
it
for
publication
the
form
of
bicycle
he
rode
long
ago
became
antiquated
but
in
the
humor
of
his
pleasantry
is
a
quality
which
does
not
grow
old
a
b
p
i
i
thought
the
matter
over
and
concluded
i
could
do
it
so
i
went
down
and
bought
a
barrel
of
pond's
extract
and
a
bicycle
the
expert
came
home
with
me
to
instruct
me
we
chose
the
back
yard
for
the
sake
of
privacy
and
went
to
work
mine
was
not
a
full
grown
bicycle
but
only
a
colt
a
fifty
inch
with
the
pedals
shortened
up
to
forty
eight
and
skittish
like
any
other
colt
the
expert
explained
the
thing's
points
briefly
then
he
got
on
its
back
and
rode
around
a
little
to
show
me
how
easy
it
was
to
do
he
said
that
the
dismounting
was
perhaps
the
hardest
thing
to
learn
and
so
we
would
leave
that
to
the
last
but
he
was
in
error
there
he
found
to
his
surprise
and
joy
that
all
that
he
needed
to
do
was
to
get
me
on
to
the
machine
and
stand
out
of
the
way
i
could
get
off
myself
although
i
was
wholly
inexperienced
i
dismounted
in
the
best
time
on
record
he
was
on
that
side
shoving
up
the
machine
we
all
came
down
with
a
crash
he
at
the
bottom
i
next
and
the
machine
on
top
we
examined
the
machine
but
it
was
not
in
the
least
injured
this
was
hardly
believable
yet
the
expert
assured
me
that
it
was
true
in
fact
the
examination
proved
it
i
was
partly
to
realize
then
how
admirably
these
things
are
constructed
we
applied
some
pond's
extract
and
resumed
the
expert
got
on
the
other
side
to
shove
up
this
time
but
i
dismounted
on
that
side
so
the
result
was
as
before
the
machine
was
not
hurt
we
oiled
ourselves
up
again
and
resumed
this
time
the
expert
took
up
a
sheltered
position
behind
but
somehow
or
other
we
landed
on
him
again
he
was
full
of
surprised
admiration
said
it
was
abnormal
she
was
all
right
not
a
scratch
on
her
not
a
timber
started
anywhere
i
said
it
was
wonderful
while
we
were
greasing
up
but
he
said
that
when
i
came
to
know
these
steel
spider
webs
i
would
realize
that
nothing
but
dynamite
could
cripple
them
then
he
limped
out
to
position
and
we
resumed
once
more
this
time
the
expert
took
up
the
position
of
short
stop
and
got
a
man
to
shove
up
behind
we
got
up
a
handsome
speed
and
presently
traversed
a
brick
and
i
went
out
over
the
top
of
the
tiller
and
landed
head
down
on
the
instructor's
back
and
saw
the
machine
fluttering
in
the
air
between
me
and
the
sun
it
was
well
it
came
down
on
us
for
that
broke
the
fall
and
it
was
not
injured
five
days
later
i
got
out
and
was
carried
down
to
the
hospital
and
found
the
expert
doing
pretty
fairly
in
a
few
more
days
i
was
quite
sound
i
attribute
this
to
my
prudence
in
always
dismounting
on
something
soft
some
recommend
a
feather
bed
but
i
think
an
expert
is
better
the
expert
got
out
at
last
brought
four
assistants
with
him
it
was
a
good
idea
these
four
held
the
graceful
cobweb
upright
while
i
climbed
into
the
saddle
then
they
formed
in
column
and
marched
on
either
side
of
me
while
the
expert
pushed
behind
all
hands
assisted
at
the
dismount
the
bicycle
had
what
is
called
the
wabbles
and
had
them
very
badly
in
order
to
keep
my
position
a
good
many
things
were
required
of
me
and
in
every
instance
the
thing
required
was
against
nature
against
nature
but
not
against
the
laws
of
nature
that
is
to
say
that
whatever
the
needed
thing
might
be
my
nature
habit
and
breeding
moved
me
to
attempt
it
in
one
way
while
some
immutable
and
unsuspected
law
of
physics
required
that
it
be
done
in
just
the
other
way
i
perceived
by
this
how
radically
and
grotesquely
wrong
had
been
the
life
long
education
of
my
body
and
members
they
were
steeped
in
ignorance
they
knew
nothing
nothing
which
it
could
profit
them
to
know
for
instance
if
i
found
myself
falling
to
the
right
i
put
the
tiller
hard
down
the
other
way
by
a
quite
natural
impulse
and
so
violated
a
law
and
kept
on
going
down
the
law
required
the
opposite
thing
the
big
wheel
must
be
turned
in
the
direction
in
which
you
are
falling
it
is
hard
to
believe
this
when
you
are
told
it
and
not
merely
hard
to
believe
it
but
impossible
it
is
opposed
to
all
your
notions
and
it
is
just
as
hard
to
do
it
after
you
do
come
to
believe
it
believing
it
and
knowing
by
the
most
convincing
proof
that
it
is
true
does
not
help
it
you
can't
any
more
do
it
than
you
could
before
you
can
neither
force
nor
persuade
yourself
to
do
it
at
first
the
intellect
has
to
come
to
the
front
now
it
has
to
teach
the
limbs
to
discard
their
old
education
and
adopt
the
new
the
steps
of
one's
progress
are
distinctly
marked
at
the
end
of
each
lesson
he
knows
he
has
acquired
something
and
he
also
knows
what
that
something
is
and
likewise
that
it
will
stay
with
him
it
is
not
like
studying
german
where
you
mull
along
in
a
groping
uncertain
way
for
thirty
years
and
at
last
just
as
you
think
you've
got
it
they
spring
the
subjunctive
on
you
and
there
you
are
no
and
i
see
now
plainly
enough
that
the
great
pity
about
the
german
language
is
that
you
can't
fall
off
it
and
hurt
yourself
there
is
nothing
like
that
feature
to
make
you
attend
strictly
to
business
but
i
also
see
by
what
i
have
learned
of
bicycling
that
the
right
and
only
sure
way
to
learn
german
is
by
the
bicycling
method
that
is
to
say
take
a
grip
on
one
villainy
of
it
at
a
time
and
learn
it
not
ease
up
and
shirk
to
the
next
leaving
that
one
half
learned
when
you
have
reached
the
point
in
bicycling
where
you
can
balance
the
machine
tolerably
fairly
and
propel
it
and
steer
it
then
comes
your
next
task
how
to
mount
it
you
do
it
in
this
way
you
hop
along
behind
it
on
your
right
foot
resting
the
other
on
the
mounting
peg
and
grasping
the
tiller
with
your
hands
at
the
word
you
rise
on
the
peg
stiffen
your
left
leg
hang
your
other
one
around
in
the
air
in
a
general
in
indefinite
way
lean
your
stomach
against
the
rear
of
the
saddle
and
then
fall
off
maybe
on
one
side
maybe
on
the
other
but
you
fall
off
you
get
up
and
do
it
again
and
once
more
and
then
several
times
by
this
time
you
have
learned
to
keep
your
balance
and
also
to
steer
without
wrenching
the
tiller
out
by
the
roots
i
say
tiller
because
it
is
a
tiller
handle
bar
is
a
lamely
descriptive
phrase
so
you
steer
along
straight
ahead
a
little
while
then
you
rise
forward
with
a
steady
strain
bringing
your
right
leg
and
then
your
body
into
the
saddle
catch
your
breath
fetch
a
violent
hitch
this
way
and
then
that
and
down
you
go
again
but
you
have
ceased
to
mind
the
going
down
by
this
time
you
are
getting
to
light
on
one
foot
or
the
other
with
considerable
certainty
six
more
attempts
and
six
more
falls
make
you
perfect
you
land
in
the
saddle
comfortably
next
time
and
stay
there
that
is
if
you
can
be
content
to
let
your
legs
dangle
and
leave
the
pedals
alone
a
while
but
if
you
grab
at
once
for
the
pedals
you
are
gone
again
you
soon
learn
to
wait
a
little
and
perfect
your
balance
before
reaching
for
the
pedals
then
the
mounting
art
is
acquired
is
complete
and
a
little
practice
will
make
it
simple
and
easy
to
you
though
spectators
ought
to
keep
off
a
rod
or
two
to
one
side
along
at
first
if
you
have
nothing
against
them
and
now
you
come
to
the
voluntary
dismount
you
learned
the
other
kind
first
of
all
it
is
quite
easy
to
tell
one
how
to
do
the
voluntary
dismount
the
words
are
few
the
requirement
simple
and
apparently
undifficult
let
your
left
pedal
go
down
till
your
left
leg
is
nearly
straight
turn
your
wheel
to
the
left
and
get
off
as
you
would
from
a
horse
it
certainly
does
sound
exceedingly
easy
but
it
isn't
i
don't
know
why
it
isn't
but
it
isn't
try
as
you
may
you
don't
get
down
as
you
would
from
a
horse
you
get
down
as
you
would
from
a
house
afire
you
make
a
spectacle
of
yourself
every
time
ii
during
the
eight
days
i
took
a
daily
lesson
of
an
hour
and
a
half
at
the
end
of
this
twelve
working
hours
apprenticeship
i
was
graduated
in
the
rough
i
was
pronounced
competent
to
paddle
my
own
bicycle
without
outside
help
it
seems
incredible
this
celerity
of
acquirement
it
takes
considerably
longer
than
that
to
learn
horseback
riding
in
the
rough
now
it
is
true
that
i
could
have
learned
without
a
teacher
but
it
would
have
been
risky
for
me
because
of
my
natural
clumsiness
the
self
taught
man
seldom
knows
anything
accurately
and
he
does
not
know
a
tenth
as
much
as
he
could
have
known
if
he
had
worked
under
teachers
and
besides
he
brags
and
is
the
means
of
fooling
other
thoughtless
people
into
going
and
doing
as
he
himself
has
done
there
are
those
who
imagine
that
the
unlucky
accidents
of
life
life's
experiences
are
in
some
way
useful
to
us
i
wish
i
could
find
out
how
i
never
knew
one
of
them
to
happen
twice
they
always
change
off
and
swap
around
and
catch
you
on
your
inexperienced
side
if
personal
experience
can
be
worth
anything
as
an
education
it
wouldn't
seem
likely
that
you
could
trip
methuselah
and
yet
if
that
old
person
could
come
back
here
it
is
more
than
likely
that
one
of
the
first
things
he
would
do
would
be
to
take
hold
of
one
of
these
electric
wires
and
tie
himself
all
up
in
a
knot
now
the
surer
thing
and
the
wiser
thing
would
be
for
him
to
ask
somebody
whether
it
was
a
good
thing
to
take
hold
of
but
that
would
not
suit
him
he
would
be
one
of
the
self
taught
kind
that
go
by
experience
he
would
want
to
examine
for
himself
and
he
would
find
for
his
instruction
that
the
coiled
patriarch
shuns
the
electric
wire
and
it
would
be
useful
to
him
too
and
would
leave
his
education
in
quite
a
complete
and
rounded
out
condition
till
he
should
come
again
some
day
and
go
to
bouncing
a
dynamite
can
around
to
find
out
what
was
in
it
but
we
wander
from
the
point
however
get
a
teacher
it
saves
much
time
and
pond's
extract
before
taking
final
leave
of
me
my
instructor
inquired
concerning
my
physical
strength
and
i
was
able
to
inform
him
that
i
hadn't
any
he
said
that
that
was
a
defect
which
would
make
up
hill
wheeling
pretty
difficult
for
me
at
first
but
he
also
said
the
bicycle
would
soon
remove
it
the
contrast
between
his
muscles
and
mine
was
quite
marked
he
wanted
to
test
mine
so
i
offered
my
biceps
which
was
my
best
it
almost
made
him
smile
he
said
it
is
pulpy
and
soft
and
yielding
and
rounded
it
evades
pressure
and
glides
from
under
the
fingers
in
the
dark
a
body
might
think
it
was
an
oyster
in
a
rag
perhaps
this
made
me
look
grieved
for
he
added
briskly
oh
that's
all
right
you
needn't
worry
about
that
in
a
little
while
you
can't
tell
it
from
a
petrified
kidney
just
go
right
along
with
your
practice
you're
all
right
then
he
left
me
and
i
started
out
alone
to
seek
adventures
you
don't
really
have
to
seek
them
that
is
nothing
but
a
phrase
they
come
to
you
i
chose
a
reposeful
sabbath
day
sort
of
a
back
street
which
was
about
thirty
yards
wide
between
the
curbstones
i
knew
it
was
not
wide
enough
still
i
thought
that
by
keeping
strict
watch
and
wasting
no
space
unnecessarily
i
could
crowd
through
of
course
i
had
trouble
mounting
the
machine
entirely
on
my
own
responsibility
with
no
encouraging
moral
support
from
the
outside
no
sympathetic
instructor
to
say
good
now
you're
doing
well
good
again
don't
hurry
there
now
you're
all
right
brace
up
go
ahead
in
place
of
this
i
had
some
other
support
this
was
a
boy
who
was
perched
on
a
gate
post
munching
a
hunk
of
maple
sugar
he
was
full
of
interest
and
comment
the
first
time
i
failed
and
went
down
he
said
that
if
he
was
me
he
would
dress
up
in
pillows
that's
what
he
would
do
the
next
time
i
went
down
he
advised
me
to
go
and
learn
to
ride
a
tricycle
first
the
third
time
i
collapsed
he
said
he
didn't
believe
i
could
stay
on
a
horse
car
but
the
next
time
i
succeeded
and
got
clumsily
under
way
in
a
weaving
tottering
uncertain
fashion
and
occupying
pretty
much
all
of
the
street
my
slow
and
lumbering
gait
filled
the
boy
to
the
chin
with
scorn
and
he
sung
out
my
but
don't
he
rip
along
then
he
got
down
from
his
post
and
loafed
along
the
sidewalk
still
observing
and
occasionally
commenting
presently
he
dropped
into
my
wake
and
followed
along
behind
a
little
girl
passed
by
balancing
a
wash
board
on
her
head
and
giggled
and
seemed
about
to
make
a
remark
but
the
boy
said
rebukingly
let
him
alone
he's
going
to
a
funeral
i
have
been
familiar
with
that
street
for
years
and
had
always
supposed
it
was
a
dead
level
but
it
was
not
as
the
bicycle
now
informed
me
to
my
surprise
the
bicycle
in
the
hands
of
a
novice
is
as
alert
and
acute
as
a
spirit
level
in
the
detecting
of
delicate
and
vanishing
shades
of
difference
in
these
matters
it
notices
a
rise
where
your
untrained
eye
would
not
observe
that
one
existed
it
notices
any
decline
which
water
will
run
down
i
was
toiling
up
a
slight
rise
but
was
not
aware
of
it
it
made
me
tug
and
pant
and
perspire
and
still
labor
as
i
might
the
machine
came
almost
to
a
standstill
every
little
while
at
such
times
the
boy
would
say
that's
it
take
a
rest
there
ain't
no
hurry
they
can't
hold
the
funeral
without
you
stones
were
a
bother
to
me
even
the
smallest
ones
gave
me
a
panic
when
i
went
over
them
i
could
hit
any
kind
of
a
stone
no
matter
how
small
if
i
tried
to
miss
it
and
of
course
at
first
i
couldn't
help
trying
to
do
that
it
is
but
natural
it
is
part
of
the
ass
that
is
put
in
us
all
for
some
inscrutable
reason
i
was
at
the
end
of
my
course
at
last
and
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
round
to
this
is
not
a
pleasant
thing
when
you
undertake
it
for
the
first
time
on
your
own
responsibility
and
neither
is
it
likely
to
succeed
your
confidence
oozes
away
you
fill
steadily
up
with
nameless
apprehensions
every
fiber
of
you
is
tense
with
a
watchful
strain
you
start
a
cautious
and
gradual
curve
but
your
squirmy
nerves
are
all
full
of
electric
anxieties
so
the
curve
is
quickly
demoralized
into
a
jerky
and
perilous
zigzag
then
suddenly
the
nickel
clad
horse
takes
the
bit
in
its
mouth
and
goes
slanting
for
the
curbstone
defying
all
prayers
and
all
your
powers
to
change
its
mind
your
heart
stands
still
your
breath
hangs
fire
your
legs
forget
to
work
straight
on
you
go
and
there
are
but
a
couple
of
feet
between
you
and
the
curb
now
and
now
is
the
desperate
moment
the
last
chance
to
save
yourself
of
course
all
your
instructions
fly
out
of
your
head
and
you
whirl
your
wheel
away
from
the
curb
instead
of
toward
it
and
so
you
go
sprawling
on
that
granite
bound
inhospitable
shore
that
was
my
luck
that
was
my
experience
i
dragged
myself
out
from
under
the
indestructible
bicycle
and
sat
down
on
the
curb
to
examine
i
started
on
the
return
trip
it
was
now
that
i
saw
a
farmer's
wagon
poking
along
down
toward
me
loaded
with
cabbages
if
i
needed
anything
to
perfect
the
precariousness
of
my
steering
it
was
just
that
the
farmer
was
occupying
the
middle
of
the
road
with
his
wagon
leaving
barely
fourteen
or
fifteen
yards
of
space
on
either
side
i
couldn't
shout
at
him
a
beginner
can't
shout
if
he
opens
his
mouth
he
is
gone
he
must
keep
all
his
attention
on
his
business
but
in
this
grisly
emergency
the
boy
came
to
the
rescue
and
for
once
i
had
to
be
grateful
to
him
he
kept
a
sharp
lookout
on
the
swiftly
varying
impulses
and
inspirations
of
my
bicycle
and
shouted
to
the
man
accordingly
to
the
left
turn
to
the
left
or
this
jackass
ll
run
over
you
the
man
started
to
do
it
no
to
the
right
to
the
right
hold
on
that
won't
do
to
the
left
to
the
right
to
the
left
right
left
ri
stay
where
you
are
or
you're
a
goner
and
just
then
i
caught
the
off
horse
in
the
starboard
and
went
down
in
a
pile
i
said
hang
it
couldn't
you
see
i
was
coming
yes
i
see
you
was
coming
but
i
couldn't
tell
which
way
you
was
coming
nobody
could
now
could
they
you
couldn't
yourself
now
could
you
so
what
could
i
do
there
was
something
in
that
and
so
i
had
the
magnanimity
to
say
so
i
said
i
was
no
doubt
as
much
to
blame
as
he
was
within
the
next
five
days
i
achieved
so
much
progress
that
the
boy
couldn't
keep
up
with
me
he
had
to
go
back
to
his
gate
post
and
content
himself
with
watching
me
fall
at
long
range
there
was
a
row
of
low
stepping
stones
across
one
end
of
the
street
a
measured
yard
apart
even
after
i
got
so
i
could
steer
pretty
fairly
i
was
so
afraid
of
those
stones
that
i
always
hit
them
they
gave
me
the
worst
falls
i
ever
got
in
that
street
except
those
which
i
got
from
dogs
i
have
seen
it
stated
that
no
expert
is
quick
enough
to
run
over
a
dog
that
a
dog
is
always
able
to
skip
out
of
his
way
i
think
that
that
may
be
true
but
i
think
that
the
reason
he
couldn't
run
over
the
dog
was
because
he
was
trying
to
i
did
not
try
to
run
over
any
dog
but
i
ran
over
every
dog
that
came
along
i
think
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
if
you
try
to
run
over
the
dog
he
knows
how
to
calculate
but
if
you
are
trying
to
miss
him
he
does
not
know
how
to
calculate
and
is
liable
to
jump
the
wrong
way
every
time
it
was
always
so
in
my
experience
even
when
i
could
not
hit
a
wagon
i
could
hit
a
dog
that
came
to
see
me
practice
they
all
liked
to
see
me
practice
and
they
all
came
for
there
was
very
little
going
on
in
our
neighborhood
to
entertain
a
dog
it
took
time
to
learn
to
miss
a
dog
but
i
achieved
even
that
i
can
steer
as
well
as
i
want
to
now
and
i
will
catch
that
boy
out
one
of
these
days
and
run
over
him
if
he
doesn't
reform
get
a
bicycle
you
will
not
regret
it
if
you
live
is
shakespeare
dead
from
my
autobiography
scattered
here
and
there
through
the
stacks
of
unpublished
manuscript
which
constitute
this
formidable
autobiography
and
diary

in

are

and
we
read
about

with
deep
interest
and
discuss
them
with
loving
sympathy
or
with
rancorous
resentment
according
to
which
side
we
hitch
ourselves
to
it
has
always
been
so
with
the
human
race
there
was
never
a
claimant
that
couldn't
get
a
hearing
nor
one
that
couldn't
accumulate
a
rapturous
following
no
matter
how
flimsy
and
apparently
unauthentic
his
claim
might
be
arthur
orton's
claim
that
he
was
the
lost
tichborne
baronet
come
to
life
again
was
as
flimsy
as
mrs
eddy's
that
she
wrote
science
and
health
from
the
direct
dictation
of
the
deity
yet
in
england
nearly
forty
years
ago
orton
had
a
huge
army
of
devotees
and
incorrigible
adherents
many
of
whom
remained
stubbornly
unconvinced
after
their
fat
god
had
been
proven
an
impostor
and
jailed
as
a
perjurer
and
today
mrs
eddy's
following
is
not
only
immense
but
is
daily
augmenting
in
numbers
and
enthusiasm
orton
had
many
fine
and
educated
minds
among
his
adherents
mrs
eddy
has
had
the
like
among
hers
from
the
beginning
her
church
is
as
well
equipped
in
those
particulars
as
is
any
other
church
claimants
can
always
count
upon
a
following
it
doesn't
matter
who
they
are
nor
what
they
claim
nor
whether
they
come
with
documents
or
without
it
was
always
so
down
out
of
the
long
vanished
past
across
the
abyss
of
the
ages
if
you
listen
you
can
still
hear
the
believing
multitudes
shouting
for
perkin
warbeck
and
lambert
simnel
a
friend
has
sent
me
a
new
book
from
england
the
shakespeare
problem
restated
well
restated
and
closely
reasoned
and
my
fifty
years
interest
in
that
matter
asleep
for
the
last
three
years
is
excited
once
more
it
is
an
interest
which
was
born
of
delia
bacon's
book
away
back
in
that
ancient
day
or
maybe
about
a
year
later
my
pilot
master
bixby
transferred
me
from
his
own
steamboat
to
the
pennsylvania
and
placed
me
under
the
orders
and
instructions
of
george
ealer
dead
now
these
many
many
years
i
steered
for
him
a
good
many
months
as
was
the
humble
duty
of
the
pilot
apprentice
stood
a
daylight
watch
and
spun
the
wheel
under
the
severe
superintendence
and
correction
of
the
master
he
was
a
prime
chess
player
and
an
idolater
of
shakespeare
he
would
play
chess
with
anybody
even
with
me
and
it
cost
his
official
dignity
something
to
do
that
also
quite
uninvited
he
would
read
shakespeare
to
me
not
just
casually
but
by
the
hour
when
it
was
his
watch
and
i
was
steering
he
read
well
but
not
profitably
for
me
because
he
constantly
injected
commands
into
the
text
that
broke
it
all
up
mixed
it
all
up
tangled
it
all
up
to
that
degree
in
fact
that
if
we
were
in
a
risky
and
difficult
piece
of
river
an
ignorant
person
couldn't
have
told
sometimes
which
observations
were
shakespeare's
and
which
were
ealer's
for
instance
what
man
dare
i
dare
approach
thou
what
are
you
laying
in
the
leads
for
what
a
hell
of
an
idea
like
the
rugged
ease
her
off
a
little
ease
her
off
rugged
russian
bear
the
armed
rhinoceros
or
the
there
she
goes
meet
her
meet
her
didn't
you
know
she'd
smell
the
reef
if
you
crowded
it
like
that
hyrcan
tiger
take
any
shape
but
that
and
my
firm
nerves
she'll
be
in
the
woods
the
first
you
know
stop
the
starboard
come
ahead
strong
on
the
larboard
back
the
starboard
now
then
you're
all
right
come
ahead
on
the
starboard
straighten
up
and
go
long
never
tremble
or
be
alive
again
and
dare
me
to
the
desert
damnation
can't
you
keep
away
from
that
greasy
water
pull
her
down
snatch
her
snatch
her
baldheaded
with
thy
sword
if
trembling
i
inhabit
then
lay
in
the
leads
no
only
with
the
starboard
one
leave
the
other
alone
protest
me
the
baby
of
a
girl
hence
horrible
shadow
eight
bells
that
watchman's
asleep
again
i
reckon
go
down
and
call
brown
yourself
unreal
mockery
hence
he
certainly
was
a
good
reader
and
splendidly
thrilling
and
stormy
and
tragic
but
it
was
a
damage
to
me
because
i
have
never
since
been
able
to
read
shakespeare
in
a
calm
and
sane
way
i
cannot
rid
it
of
his
explosive
interlardings
they
break
in
everywhere
with
their
irrelevant
what
in
hell
are
you
up
to
now
pull
her
down
more
more
there
now
steady
as
you
go
and
the
other
disorganizing
interruptions
that
were
always
leaping
from
his
mouth
when
i
read
shakespeare
now
i
can
hear
them
as
plainly
as
i
did
in
that
long
departed
time
fifty
one
years
ago
i
never
regarded
ealer's
readings
as
educational
indeed
they
were
a
detriment
to
me
his
contributions
to
the
text
seldom
improved
it
but
barring
that
detail
he
was
a
good
reader
i
can
say
that
much
for
him
he
did
not
use
the
book
and
did
not
need
to
he
knew
his
shakespeare
as
well
as
euclid
ever
knew
his
multiplication
table
did
he
have
something
to
say
this
shakespeare
adoring
mississippi
pilot
anent
delia
bacon's
book
yes
and
he
said
it
said
it
all
the
time
for
months
in
the
morning
watch
the
middle
watch
and
dog
watch
and
probably
kept
it
going
in
his
sleep
he
bought
the
literature
of
the
dispute
as
fast
as
it
appeared
and
we
discussed
it
all
through
thirteen
hundred
miles
of
river
four
times
traversed
in
every
thirty
five
days
the
time
required
by
that
swift
boat
to
achieve
two
round
trips
we
discussed
and
discussed
and
discussed
and
disputed
and
disputed
and
disputed
at
any
rate
he
did
and
i
got
in
a
word
now
and
then
when
he
slipped
a
cog
and
there
was
a
vacancy
he
did
his
arguing
with
heat
with
energy
with
violence
and
i
did
mine
with
the
reserve
and
moderation
of
a
subordinate
who
does
not
like
to
be
flung
out
of
a
pilot
house
that
is
perched
forty
feet
above
the
water
he
was
fiercely
loyal
to
shakespeare
and
cordially
scornful
of
bacon
and
of
all
the
pretensions
of
the
baconians
so
was
i
at
first
and
at
first
he
was
glad
that
that
was
my
attitude
there
were
even
indications
that
he
admired
it
indications
dimmed
it
is
true
by
the
distance
that
lay
between
the
lofty
boss
pilotical
altitude
and
my
lowly
one
yet
perceptible
to
me
perceptible
and
translatable
into
a
compliment
compliment
coming
down
from
above
the
snow
line
and
not
well
thawed
in
the
transit
and
not
likely
to
set
anything
afire
not
even
a
cub
pilot's
self
conceit
still
a
detectable
complement
and
precious
naturally
it
flattered
me
into
being
more
loyal
to
shakespeare
if
possible
than
i
was
before
and
more
prejudiced
against
bacon
if
possible
than
i
was
before
and
so
we
discussed
and
discussed
both
on
the
same
side
and
were
happy
for
a
while
only
for
a
while
only
for
a
very
little
while
a
very
very
very
little
while
then
the
atmosphere
began
to
change
began
to
cool
off
a
brighter
person
would
have
seen
what
the
trouble
was
earlier
than
i
did
perhaps
but
i
saw
it
early
enough
for
all
practical
purposes
you
see
he
was
of
an
argumentative
disposition
therefore
it
took
him
but
a
little
time
to
get
tired
of
arguing
with
a
person
who
agreed
with
everything
he
said
and
consequently
never
furnished
him
a
provocative
to
flare
up
and
show
what
he
could
do
when
it
came
to
clear
cold
hard
rose
cut
hundred
faceted
diamond
flashing
reasoning
that
was
his
name
for
it
it
has
been
applied
since
with
complacency
as
many
as
several
times
in
the
bacon
shakespeare
scuffle
on
the
shakespeare
side
then
the
thing
happened
which
has
happened
to
more
persons
than
to
me
when
principle
and
personal
interest
found
themselves
in
opposition
to
each
other
and
a
choice
had
to
be
made
i
let
principle
go
and
went
over
to
the
other
side
not
the
entire
way
but
far
enough
to
answer
the
requirements
of
the
case
that
is
to
say
i
took
this
attitude
to
wit
i
only
believed
bacon
wrote
shakespeare
whereas
i
knew
shakespeare
didn't
ealer
was
satisfied
with
that
and
the
war
broke
loose
study
practice
experience
in
handling
my
end
of
the
matter
presently
enabled
me
to
take
my
new
position
almost
seriously
a
little
bit
later
utterly
seriously
a
little
later
still
lovingly
gratefully
devotedly
finally
fiercely
rabidly
uncompromisingly
after
that
i
was
welded
to
my
faith
i
was
theoretically
ready
to
die
for
it
and
i
looked
down
with
compassion
not
unmixed
with
scorn
upon
everybody
else's
faith
that
didn't
tally
with
mine
that
faith
imposed
upon
me
by
self
interest
in
that
ancient
day
remains
my
faith
today
and
in
it
i
find
comfort
solace
peace
and
never
failing
joy
you
see
how
curiously
theological
it
is
the
rice
christian
of
the
orient
goes
through
the
very
same
steps
when
he
is
after
rice
and
the
missionary
is
after
him
he
goes
for
rice
and
remains
to
worship
ealer
did
a
lot
of
our
reasoning
not
to
say
substantially
all
of
it
the
slaves
of
his
cult
have
a
passion
for
calling
it
by
that
large
name
we
others
do
not
call
our
inductions
and
deductions
and
reductions
by
any
name
at
all
they
show
for
themselves
what
they
are
and
we
can
with
tranquil
confidence
leave
the
world
to
ennoble
them
with
a
title
of
its
own
choosing
now
and
then
when
ealer
had
to
stop
to
cough
i
pulled
my
induction
talents
together
and
hove
the
controversial
lead
myself
always
getting
eight
feet
eight
and
a
half
often
nine
sometimes
even
quarter
less
twain
as
i
believed
but
always
no
bottom
as
he
said
i
got
the
best
of
him
only
once
i
prepared
myself
i
wrote
out
a
passage
from
shakespeare
it
may
have
been
the
very
one
i
quoted
awhile
ago
i
don't
remember
and
riddled
it
with
his
wild
steamboatful
interlardings
when
an
unrisky
opportunity
offered
one
lovely
summer
day
when
we
had
sounded
and
buoyed
a
tangled
patch
of
crossings
known
as
hell's
half
acre
and
were
aboard
again
and
he
had
sneaked
the
pennsylvania
triumphantly
through
it
without
once
scraping
sand
and
the
a
t
lacey
had
followed
in
our
wake
and
got
stuck
and
he
was
feeling
good
i
showed
it
to
him
it
amused
him
i
asked
him
to
fire
it
off
read
it
read
it
i
diplomatically
added
as
only
he
could
read
dramatic
poetry
the
compliment
touched
him
where
he
lived
he
did
read
it
read
it
with
surpassing
fire
and
spirit
read
it
as
it
will
never
be
read
again
for
he
knew
how
to
put
the
right
music
into
those
thunderous
interlardings
and
make
them
seem
a
part
of
the
text
make
them
sound
as
if
they
were
bursting
from
shakespeare's
own
soul
each
one
of
them
a
golden
inspiration
and
not
to
be
left
out
without
damage
to
the
massed
and
magnificent
whole
i
waited
a
week
to
let
the
incident
fade
waited
longer
waited
until
he
brought
up
for
reasonings
and
vituperation
my
pet
position
my
pet
argument
the
one
which
i
was
fondest
of
the
one
which
i
prized
far
above
all
others
in
my
ammunition
wagon
to
wit
that
shakespeare
couldn't
have
written
shakespeare's
works
for
the
reason
that
the
man
who
wrote
them
was
limitlessly
familiar
with
the
laws
and
the
law
courts
and
law
proceedings
and
lawyer
talk
and
lawyer
ways
and
if
shakespeare
was
possessed
of
the
infinitely
divided
star
dust
that
constituted
this
vast
wealth
how
did
he
get
it
and
where
and
when
from
books
from
books
that
was
always
the
idea
i
answered
as
my
readings
of
the
champions
of
my
side
of
the
great
controversy
had
taught
me
to
answer
that
a
man
can't
handle
glibly
and
easily
and
comfortably
and
successfully
the
argot
of
a
trade
at
which
he
has
not
personally
served
he
will
make
mistakes
he
will
not
and
cannot
get
the
trade
phrasings
precisely
and
exactly
right
and
the
moment
he
departs
by
even
a
shade
from
a
common
trade
form
the
reader
who
has
served
that
trade
will
know
the
writer
hasn't
ealer
would
not
be
convinced
he
said
a
man
could
learn
how
to
correctly
handle
the
subtleties
and
mysteries
and
free
masonries
of
any
trade
by
careful
reading
and
studying
but
when
i
got
him
to
read
again
the
passage
from
shakespeare
with
the
interlardings
he
perceived
himself
that
books
couldn't
teach
a
student
a
bewildering
multitude
of
pilot
phrases
so
thoroughly
and
perfectly
that
he
could
talk
them
off
in
book
and
play
or
conversation
and
make
no
mistake
that
a
pilot
would
not
immediately
discover
it
was
a
triumph
for
me
he
was
silent
awhile
and
i
knew
what
was
happening
he
was
losing
his
temper
and
i
knew
he
would
presently
close
the
session
with
the
same
old
argument
that
was
always
his
stay
and
his
support
in
time
of
need
the
same
old
argument
the
one
i
couldn't
answer
because
i
dasn't
the
argument
that
i
was
an
ass
and
better
shut
up
he
delivered
it
and
i
obeyed
o
dear
how
long
ago
it
was
how
pathetically
long
ago
and
here
am
i
old
forsaken
forlorn
and
alone
arranging
to
get
that
argument
out
of
somebody
again
when
a
man
has
a
passion
for
shakespeare
it
goes
without
saying
that
he
keeps
company
with
other
standard
authors
ealer
always
had
several
high
class
books
in
the
pilot
house
and
he
read
the
same
ones
over
and
over
again
and
did
not
care
to
change
to
newer
and
fresher
ones
he
played
well
on
the
flute
and
greatly
enjoyed
hearing
himself
play
so
did
i
he
had
a
notion
that
a
flute
would
keep
its
health
better
if
you
took
it
apart
when
it
was
not
standing
a
watch
and
so
when
it
was
not
on
duty
it
took
its
rest
disjointed
on
the
compass
shelf
under
the
breastboard
when
the
pennsylvania
blew
up
and
became
a
drifting
rack
heap
freighted
with
wounded
and
dying
poor
souls
my
young
brother
henry
among
them
pilot
brown
had
the
watch
below
and
was
probably
asleep
and
never
knew
what
killed
him
but
ealer
escaped
unhurt
he
and
his
pilot
house
were
shot
up
into
the
air
then
they
fell
and
ealer
sank
through
the
ragged
cavern
where
the
hurricane
deck
and
the
boiler
deck
had
been
and
landed
in
a
nest
of
ruins
on
the
main
deck
on
top
of
one
of
the
unexploded
boilers
where
he
lay
prone
in
a
fog
of
scald
and
deadly
steam
but
not
for
long
he
did
not
lose
his
head
long
familiarity
with
danger
had
taught
him
to
keep
it
in
any
and
all
emergencies
he
held
his
coat
lapels
to
his
nose
with
one
hand
to
keep
out
the
steam
and
scrabbled
around
with
the
other
till
he
found
the
joints
of
his
flute
then
he
took
measures
to
save
himself
alive
and
was
successful
i
was
not
on
board
i
had
been
put
ashore
in
new
orleans
by
captain
klinefelter
the
reason
however
i
have
told
all
about
it
in
the
book
called
old
times
on
the
mississippi
and
it
isn't
important
anyway
it
is
so
long
ago
ii
when
i
was
a
sunday
school
scholar
something
more
than
sixty
years
ago
i
became
interested
in
satan
and
wanted
to
find
out
all
i
could
about
him
i
began
to
ask
questions
but
my
class
teacher
mr
barclay
the
stone
mason
was
reluctant
about
answering
them
it
seemed
to
me
i
was
anxious
to
be
praised
for
turning
my
thoughts
to
serious
subjects
when
there
wasn't
another
boy
in
the
village
who
could
be
hired
to
do
such
a
thing
i
was
greatly
interested
in
the
incident
of
eve
and
the
serpent
and
thought
eve's
calmness
was
perfectly
noble
i
asked
mr
barclay
if
he
had
ever
heard
of
another
woman
who
being
approached
by
a
serpent
would
not
excuse
herself
and
break
for
the
nearest
timber
he
did
not
answer
my
question
but
rebuked
me
for
inquiring
into
matters
above
my
age
and
comprehension
i
will
say
for
mr
barclay
that
he
was
willing
to
tell
me
the
facts
of
satan's
history
but
he
stopped
there
he
wouldn't
allow
any
discussion
of
them
in
the
course
of
time
we
exhausted
the
facts
there
were
only
five
or
six
of
them
you
could
set
them
all
down
on
a
visiting
card
i
was
disappointed
i
had
been
meditating
a
biography
and
was
grieved
to
find
that
there
were
no
materials
i
said
as
much
with
the
tears
running
down
mr
barclay's
sympathy
and
compassion
were
aroused
for
he
was
a
most
kind
and
gentle
spirited
man
and
he
patted
me
on
the
head
and
cheered
me
up
by
saying
there
was
a
whole
vast
ocean
of
materials
i
can
still
feel
the
happy
thrill
which
these
blessed
words
shot
through
me
then
he
began
to
bail
out
that
ocean's
riches
for
my
encouragement
and
joy
like
this
it
was
conjectured
though
not
established
that
satan
was
originally
an
angel
in
heaven
that
he
fell
that
he
rebelled
and
brought
on
a
war
that
he
was
defeated
and
banished
to
perdition
also
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
later
he
did
so
and
so
that
we
are
warranted
in
supposing
that
at
a
subsequent
time
he
traveled
extensively
seeking
whom
he
might
devour
that
a
couple
of
centuries
afterward
as
tradition
instructs
us
he
took
up
the
cruel
trade
of
tempting
people
to
their
ruin
with
vast
and
fearful
results
that
by
and
by
as
the
probabilities
seem
to
indicate
he
may
have
done
certain
things
he
might
have
done
certain
other
things
he
must
have
done
still
other
things
and
so
on
and
so
on
we
set
down
the
five
known
facts
by
themselves
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
numbered
it
page
then
on
fifteen
hundred
other
pieces
of
paper
we
set
down
the
conjectures
and
suppositions
and
maybes
and
perhapses
and
doubtlesses
and
rumors
and
guesses
and
probabilities
and
likelihoods
and
we
are
permitted
to
thinks
and
we
are
warranted
in
believings
and
might
have
beens
and
could
have
beens
and
must
have
beens
and
unquestionablys
and
without
a
shadow
of
doubts
and
behold
materials
why
we
had
enough
to
build
a
biography
of
shakespeare
yet
he
made
me
put
away
my
pen
he
would
not
let
me
write
the
history
of
satan
why
because
as
he
said
he
had
suspicions
suspicions
that
my
attitude
in
that
matter
was
not
reverent
and
that
a
person
must
be
reverent
when
writing
about
the
sacred
characters
he
said
any
one
who
spoke
flippantly
of
satan
would
be
frowned
upon
by
the
religious
world
and
also
be
brought
to
account
i
assured
him
in
earnest
and
sincere
words
that
he
had
wholly
misconceived
my
attitude
that
i
had
the
highest
respect
for
satan
and
that
my
reverence
for
him
equaled
and
possibly
even
exceeded
that
of
any
member
of
any
church
i
said
it
wounded
me
deeply
to
perceive
by
his
words
that
he
thought
i
would
make
fun
of
satan
and
deride
him
laugh
at
him
scoff
at
him
whereas
in
truth
i
had
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
but
had
only
a
warm
desire
to
make
fun
of
those
others
and
laugh
at
them
what
others
why
the
supposers
the
perhapsers
the
might
have
beeners
the
could
have
beeners
the
must
have
beeners
the
without
a
shadow
of
doubters
the
we
are
warranted
in
believingers
and
all
that
funny
crop
of
solemn
architects
who
have
taken
a
good
solid
foundation
of
five
indisputable
and
unimportant
facts
and
built
upon
it
a
conjectural
satan
thirty
miles
high
what
did
mr
barclay
do
then
was
he
disarmed
was
he
silenced
no
he
was
shocked
he
was
so
shocked
that
he
visibly
shuddered
he
said
the
satanic
traditioners
and
perhapsers
and
conjecturers
were
themselves
sacred
as
sacred
as
their
work
so
sacred
that
whoso
ventured
to
mock
them
or
make
fun
of
their
work
could
not
afterward
enter
any
respectable
house
even
by
the
back
door
how
true
were
his
words
and
how
wise
how
fortunate
it
would
have
been
for
me
if
i
had
heeded
them
but
i
was
young
i
was
but
seven
years
of
age
and
vain
foolish
and
anxious
to
attract
attention
i
wrote
the
biography
and
have
never
been
in
a
respectable
house
since
iii
how
curious
and
interesting
is
the
parallel
as
far
as
poverty
of
biographical
details
is
concerned
between
satan
and
shakespeare
it
is
wonderful
it
is
unique
it
stands
quite
alone
there
is
nothing
resembling
it
in
history
nothing
resembling
it
in
romance
nothing
approaching
it
even
in
tradition
how
sublime
is
their
position
and
how
over
topping
how
sky
reaching
how
supreme
the
two
great
unknowns
the
two
illustrious
conjecturabilities
they
are
the
best
known
unknown
persons
that
have
ever
drawn
breath
upon
the
planet
for
the
instruction
of
the
ignorant
i
will
make
a
list
now
of
those
details
of
shakespeare's
history
which
are
facts
verified
facts
established
facts
undisputed
facts
facts
he
was
born
on
the
of
april
of
good
farmer
class
parents
who
could
not
read
could
not
write
could
not
sign
their
names
at
stratford
a
small
back
settlement
which
in
that
day
was
shabby
and
unclean
and
densely
illiterate
of
the
nineteen
important
men
charged
with
the
government
of
the
town
thirteen
had
to
make
their
mark
in
attesting
important
documents
because
they
could
not
write
their
names
of
the
first
eighteen
years
of
his
life
nothing
is
known
they
are
a
blank
on
the
of
november
william
shakespeare
took
out
a
license
to
marry
anne
whateley
next
day
william
shakespeare
took
out
a
license
to
marry
anne
hathaway
she
was
eight
years
his
senior
william
shakespeare
married
anne
hathaway
in
a
hurry
by
grace
of
a
reluctantly
granted
dispensation
there
was
but
one
publication
of
the
banns
within
six
months
the
first
child
was
born
about
two
blank
years
followed
during
which
period
nothing
at
all
happened
to
shakespeare
so
far
as
anybody
knows
then
came
twins
february
two
blank
years
follow
then
he
makes
a
ten
year
visit
to
london
leaving
the
family
behind
five
blank
years
follow
during
this
period
nothing
happened
to
him
as
far
as
anybody
actually
knows
then
there
is
mention
of
him
as
an
actor
next
year
his
name
appears
in
the
official
list
of
players
next
year
he
played
before
the
queen
a
detail
of
no
consequence
other
obscurities
did
it
every
year
of
the
forty
five
of
her
reign
and
remained
obscure
three
pretty
full
years
follow
full
of
play
acting
then
in
he
bought
new
place
stratford
thirteen
or
fourteen
busy
years
follow
years
in
which
he
accumulated
money
and
also
reputation
as
actor
and
manager
meantime
his
name
liberally
and
variously
spelt
had
become
associated
with
a
number
of
great
plays
and
poems
as
ostensibly
author
of
the
same
some
of
these
in
these
years
and
later
were
pirated
but
he
made
no
protest
then
he
returned
to
stratford
and
settled
down
for
good
and
all
and
busied
himself
in
lending
money
trading
in
tithes
trading
in
land
and
houses
shirking
a
debt
of
forty
one
shillings
borrowed
by
his
wife
during
his
long
desertion
of
his
family
suing
debtors
for
shillings
and
coppers
being
sued
himself
for
shillings
and
coppers
and
acting
as
confederate
to
a
neighbor
who
tried
to
rob
the
town
of
its
rights
in
a
certain
common
and
did
not
succeed
he
lived
five
or
six
years
till
in
the
joy
of
these
elevated
pursuits
then
he
made
a
will
and
signed
each
of
its
three
pages
with
his
name
a
thoroughgoing
business
man's
will
it
named
in
minute
detail
every
item
of
property
he
owned
in
the
world
houses
lands
sword
silver
gilt
bowl
and
so
on
all
the
way
down
to
his
second
best
bed
and
its
furniture
it
carefully
and
calculatingly
distributed
his
riches
among
the
members
of
his
family
overlooking
no
individual
of
it
not
even
his
wife
the
wife
he
had
been
enabled
to
marry
in
a
hurry
by
urgent
grace
of
a
special
dispensation
before
he
was
nineteen
the
wife
whom
he
had
left
husbandless
so
many
years
the
wife
who
had
had
to
borrow
forty
one
shillings
in
her
need
and
which
the
lender
was
never
able
to
collect
of
the
prosperous
husband
but
died
at
last
with
the
money
still
lacking
no
even
this
wife
was
remembered
in
shakespeare's
will
he
left
her
that
second
best
bed
and
not
another
thing
not
even
a
penny
to
bless
her
lucky
widowhood
with
it
was
eminently
and
conspicuously
a
business
man's
will
not
a
poet's
it
mentioned
not
a
single
book
books
were
much
more
precious
than
swords
and
silver
gilt
bowls
and
second
best
beds
in
those
days
and
when
a
departing
person
owned
one
he
gave
it
a
high
place
in
his
will
the
will
mentioned
not
a
play
not
a
poem
not
an
unfinished
literary
work
not
a
scrap
of
manuscript
of
any
kind
many
poets
have
died
poor
but
this
is
the
only
one
in
history
that
has
died
this
poor
the
others
all
left
literary
remains
behind
also
a
book
maybe
two
if
shakespeare
had
owned
a
dog
but
we
need
not
go
into
that
we
know
he
would
have
mentioned
it
in
his
will
if
a
good
dog
susanna
would
have
got
it
if
an
inferior
one
his
wife
would
have
got
a
dower
interest
in
it
i
wish
he
had
had
a
dog
just
so
we
could
see
how
painstakingly
he
would
have
divided
that
dog
among
the
family
in
his
careful
business
way
he
signed
the
will
in
three
places
in
earlier
years
he
signed
two
other
official
documents
these
five
signatures
still
exist
there
are
no
other
specimens
of
his
penmanship
in
existence
not
a
line
was
he
prejudiced
against
the
art
his
granddaughter
whom
he
loved
was
eight
years
old
when
he
died
yet
she
had
had
no
teaching
he
left
no
provision
for
her
education
although
he
was
rich
and
in
her
mature
womanhood
she
couldn't
write
and
couldn't
tell
her
husband's
manuscript
from
anybody
else's
she
thought
it
was
shakespeare's
when
shakespeare
died
in
stratford
it
was
not
an
event
it
made
no
more
stir
in
england
than
the
death
of
any
other
forgotten
theater
actor
would
have
made
nobody
came
down
from
london
there
were
no
lamenting
poems
no
eulogies
no
national
tears
there
was
merely
silence
and
nothing
more
a
striking
contrast
with
what
happened
when
ben
jonson
and
francis
bacon
and
spenser
and
raleigh
and
the
other
distinguished
literary
folk
of
shakespeare's
time
passed
from
life
no
praiseful
voice
was
lifted
for
the
lost
bard
of
avon
even
ben
jonson
waited
seven
years
before
he
lifted
his
so
far
as
anybody
actually
knows
and
can
prove
shakespeare
of
stratford
on
avon
never
wrote
a
play
in
his
life
so
far
as
anybody
knows
and
can
prove
he
never
wrote
a
letter
to
anybody
in
his
life
so
far
as
any
one
knows
he
received
only
one
letter
during
his
life
so
far
as
any
one
knows
and
can
prove
shakespeare
of
stratford
wrote
only
one
poem
during
his
life
this
one
is
authentic
he
did
write
that
one
a
fact
which
stands
undisputed
he
wrote
the
whole
of
it
he
wrote
the
whole
of
it
out
of
his
own
head
he
commanded
that
this
work
of
art
be
engraved
upon
his
tomb
and
he
was
obeyed
there
it
abides
to
this
day
this
is
it
good
friend
for
iesus
sake
forbeare
to
digg
the
dust
encloased
heare
blest
be
ye
man
yt
spares
thes
stones
and
curst
be
he
yt
moves
my
bones
in
the
list
as
above
set
down
will
be
found
every
positively
known
fact
of
shakespeare's
life
lean
and
meager
as
the
invoice
is
beyond
these
details
we
know
not
a
thing
about
him
all
the
rest
of
his
vast
history
as
furnished
by
the
biographers
is
built
up
course
upon
course
of
guesses
inferences
theories
conjectures
an
eiffel
tower
of
artificialities
rising
sky
high
from
a
very
flat
and
very
thin
foundation
of
inconsequential
facts
iv
conjectures
the
historians
suppose
that
shakespeare
attended
the
free
school
in
stratford
from
the
time
he
was
seven
years
old
till
he
was
thirteen
there
is
no
evidence
in
existence
that
he
ever
went
to
school
at
all
the
historians
infer
that
he
got
his
latin
in
that
school
the
school
which
they
suppose
he
attended
they
suppose
his
father's
declining
fortunes
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
leave
the
school
they
supposed
he
attended
and
get
to
work
and
help
support
his
parents
and
their
ten
children
but
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
ever
entered
or
returned
from
the
school
they
suppose
he
attended
they
suppose
he
assisted
his
father
in
the
butchering
business
and
that
being
only
a
boy
he
didn't
have
to
do
full
grown
butchering
but
only
slaughtered
calves
also
that
whenever
he
killed
a
calf
he
made
a
high
flown
speech
over
it
this
supposition
rests
upon
the
testimony
of
a
man
who
wasn't
there
at
the
time
a
man
who
got
it
from
a
man
who
could
have
been
there
but
did
not
say
whether
he
was
nor
not
and
neither
of
them
thought
to
mention
it
for
decades
and
decades
and
decades
and
two
more
decades
after
shakespeare's
death
until
old
age
and
mental
decay
had
refreshed
and
vivified
their
memories
they
hadn't
two
facts
in
stock
about
the
long
dead
distinguished
citizen
but
only
just
the
one
he
slaughtered
calves
and
broke
into
oratory
while
he
was
at
it
curious
they
had
only
one
fact
yet
the
distinguished
citizen
had
spent
twenty
six
years
in
that
little
town
just
half
his
lifetime
however
rightly
viewed
it
was
the
most
important
fact
indeed
almost
the
only
important
fact
of
shakespeare's
life
in
stratford
rightly
viewed
for
experience
is
an
author's
most
valuable
asset
experience
is
the
thing
that
puts
the
muscle
and
the
breath
and
the
warm
blood
into
the
book
he
writes
rightly
viewed
calf
butchering
accounts
for
titus
andronicus
the
only
play
ain't
it
that
the
stratford
shakespeare
ever
wrote
and
yet
it
is
the
only
one
everybody
tried
to
chouse
him
out
of
the
baconians
included
the
historians
find
themselves
justified
in
believing
that
the
young
shakespeare
poached
upon
sir
thomas
lucy's
deer
preserves
and
got
haled
before
that
magistrate
for
it
but
there
is
no
shred
of
respectworthy
evidence
that
anything
of
the
kind
happened
the
historians
having
argued
the
thing
that
might
have
happened
into
the
thing
that
did
happen
found
no
trouble
in
turning
sir
thomas
lucy
into
mr
justice
shallow
they
have
long
ago
convinced
the
world
on
surmise
and
without
trustworthy
evidence
that
shallow
is
sir
thomas
the
next
addition
to
the
young
shakespeare's
stratford
history
comes
easy
the
historian
builds
it
out
of
the
surmised
deer
steeling
and
the
surmised
trial
before
the
magistrate
and
the
surmised
vengeance
prompted
satire
upon
the
magistrate
in
the
play
result
the
young
shakespeare
was
a
wild
wild
wild
oh
such
a
wild
young
scamp
and
that
gratuitous
slander
is
established
for
all
time
it
is
the
very
way
professor
osborn
and
i
built
the
colossal
skeleton
brontosaur
that
stands
fifty
seven
feet
long
and
sixteen
feet
high
in
the
natural
history
museum
the
awe
and
admiration
of
all
the
world
the
stateliest
skeleton
that
exists
on
the
planet
we
had
nine
bones
and
we
built
the
rest
of
him
out
of
plaster
of
paris
we
ran
short
of
plaster
of
paris
or
we'd
have
built
a
brontosaur
that
could
sit
down
beside
the
stratford
shakespeare
and
none
but
an
expert
could
tell
which
was
biggest
or
contained
the
most
plaster
shakespeare
pronounced
venus
and
adonis
the
first
heir
of
his
invention
apparently
implying
that
it
was
his
first
effort
at
literary
composition
he
should
not
have
said
it
it
has
been
an
embarrassment
to
his
historians
these
many
many
years
they
have
to
make
him
write
that
graceful
and
polished
and
flawless
and
beautiful
poem
before
he
escaped
from
stratford
and
his
family
or
age
twenty
two
or
along
there
because
within
the
next
five
years
he
wrote
five
great
plays
and
could
not
have
found
time
to
write
another
line
it
is
sorely
embarrassing
if
he
began
to
slaughter
calves
and
poach
deer
and
rollick
around
and
learn
english
at
the
earliest
likely
moment
say
at
thirteen
when
he
was
supposably
wrenched
from
that
school
where
he
was
supposably
storing
up
latin
for
future
literary
use
he
had
his
youthful
hands
full
and
much
more
than
full
he
must
have
had
to
put
aside
his
warwickshire
dialect
which
wouldn't
be
understood
in
london
and
study
english
very
hard
very
hard
indeed
incredibly
hard
almost
if
the
result
of
that
labor
was
to
be
the
smooth
and
rounded
and
flexible
and
letter
perfect
english
of
the
venus
and
adonis
in
the
space
of
ten
years
and
at
the
same
time
learn
great
and
fine
and
unsurpassable
literary
form
however
it
is
conjectured
that
he
accomplished
all
this
and
more
much
more
learned
law
and
its
intricacies
and
the
complex
procedure
of
the
law
courts
and
all
about
soldiering
and
sailoring
and
the
manners
and
customs
and
ways
of
royal
courts
and
aristocratic
society
and
likewise
accumulated
in
his
one
head
every
kind
of
knowledge
the
learned
then
possessed
and
every
kind
of
humble
knowledge
possessed
by
the
lowly
and
the
ignorant
and
added
thereto
a
wider
and
more
intimate
knowledge
of
the
world's
great
literatures
ancient
and
modern
than
was
possessed
by
any
other
man
of
his
time
for
he
was
going
to
make
brilliant
and
easy
and
admiration
compelling
use
of
these
splendid
treasures
the
moment
he
got
to
london
and
according
to
the
surmisers
that
is
what
he
did
yes
although
there
was
no
one
in
stratford
able
to
teach
him
these
things
and
no
library
in
the
little
village
to
dig
them
out
of
his
father
could
not
read
and
even
the
surmisers
surmise
that
he
did
not
keep
a
library
it
is
surmised
by
the
biographers
that
the
young
shakespeare
got
his
vast
knowledge
of
the
law
and
his
familiar
and
accurate
acquaintance
with
the
manners
and
customs
and
shop
talk
of
lawyers
through
being
for
a
time
the
clerk
of
a
stratford
court
just
as
a
bright
lad
like
me
reared
in
a
village
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
might
become
perfect
in
knowledge
of
the
bering
strait
whale
fishery
and
the
shop
talk
of
the
veteran
exercises
of
that
adventure
bristling
trade
through
catching
catfish
with
a
trot
line
sundays
but
the
surmise
is
damaged
by
the
fact
that
there
is
no
evidence
and
not
even
tradition
that
the
young
shakespeare
was
ever
clerk
of
a
law
court
it
is
further
surmised
that
the
young
shakespeare
accumulated
his
law
treasures
in
the
first
years
of
his
sojourn
in
london
through
amusing
himself
by
learning
book
law
in
his
garret
and
by
picking
up
lawyer
talk
and
the
rest
of
it
through
loitering
about
the
law
courts
and
listening
but
it
is
only
surmise
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
ever
did
either
of
those
things
they
are
merely
a
couple
of
chunks
of
plaster
of
paris
there
is
a
legend
that
he
got
his
bread
and
butter
by
holding
horses
in
front
of
the
london
theaters
mornings
and
afternoons
maybe
he
did
if
he
did
it
seriously
shortened
his
law
study
hours
and
his
recreation
time
in
the
courts
in
those
very
days
he
was
writing
great
plays
and
needed
all
the
time
he
could
get
the
horse
holding
legend
ought
to
be
strangled
it
too
formidably
increases
the
historian's
difficulty
in
accounting
for
the
young
shakespeare's
erudition
an
erudition
which
he
was
acquiring
hunk
by
hunk
and
chunk
by
chunk
every
day
in
those
strenuous
times
and
emptying
each
day's
catch
into
next
day's
imperishable
drama
he
had
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
war
at
the
same
time
and
a
knowledge
of
soldier
people
and
sailor
people
and
their
ways
and
talk
also
a
knowledge
of
some
foreign
lands
and
their
languages
for
he
was
daily
emptying
fluent
streams
of
these
various
knowledges
too
into
his
dramas
how
did
he
acquire
these
rich
assets
in
the
usual
way
by
surmise
it
is
surmised
that
he
traveled
in
italy
and
germany
and
around
and
qualified
himself
to
put
their
scenic
and
social
aspects
upon
paper
that
he
perfected
himself
in
french
italian
and
spanish
on
the
road
that
he
went
in
leicester's
expedition
to
the
low
countries
as
soldier
or
sutler
or
something
for
several
months
or
years
or
whatever
length
of
time
a
surmiser
needs
in
his
business
and
thus
became
familiar
with
soldiership
and
soldier
ways
and
soldier
talk
and
generalship
and
general
ways
and
general
talk
and
seamanship
and
sailor
ways
and
sailor
talk
maybe
he
did
all
these
things
but
i
would
like
to
know
who
held
the
horses
in
the
mean
time
and
who
studied
the
books
in
the
garret
and
who
frolicked
in
the
law
courts
for
recreation
also
who
did
the
call
boying
and
the
play
acting
for
he
became
a
call
boy
and
as
early
as
he
became
a
vagabond
the
law's
ungentle
term
for
an
unlisted
actor
and
in
a
regular
and
properly
and
officially
listed
member
of
that
in
those
days
lightly
valued
and
not
much
respected
profession
right
soon
thereafter
he
became
a
stockholder
in
two
theaters
and
manager
of
them
thenceforward
he
was
a
busy
and
flourishing
business
man
and
was
raking
in
money
with
both
hands
for
twenty
years
then
in
a
noble
frenzy
of
poetic
inspiration
he
wrote
his
one
poem
his
only
poem
his
darling
and
laid
him
down
and
died
good
friend
for
iesus
sake
forbeare
to
digg
the
dust
encloased
heare
blest
be
ye
man
yt
spares
thes
stones
and
curst
be
he
yt
moves
my
bones
he
was
probably
dead
when
he
wrote
it
still
this
is
only
conjecture
we
have
only
circumstantial
evidence
internal
evidence
shall
i
set
down
the
rest
of
the
conjectures
which
constitute
the
giant
biography
of
william
shakespeare
it
would
strain
the
unabridged
dictionary
to
hold
them
he
is
a
brontosaur
nine
bones
and
six
hundred
barrels
of
plaster
of
paris
v
we
may
assume
in
the
assuming
trade
three
separate
and
independent
cults
are
transacting
business
two
of
these
cults
are
known
as
the
shakespearites
and
the
baconians
and
i
am
the
other
one
the
brontosaurian
the
shakespearite
knows
that
shakespeare
wrote
shakespeare's
works
the
baconian
knows
that
francis
bacon
wrote
them
the
brontosaurian
doesn't
really
know
which
of
them
did
it
but
is
quite
composedly
and
contentedly
sure
that
shakespeare
didn't
and
strongly
suspects
that
bacon
did
we
all
have
to
do
a
good
deal
of
assuming
but
i
am
fairly
certain
that
in
every
case
i
can
call
to
mind
the
baconian
assumers
have
come
out
ahead
of
the
shakespearites
both
parties
handle
the
same
materials
but
the
baconians
seem
to
me
to
get
much
more
reasonable
and
rational
and
persuasive
results
out
of
them
than
is
the
case
with
the
shakespearites
the
shakespearite
conducts
his
assuming
upon
a
definite
principle
an
unchanging
and
immutable
law
which
is
and
and
and
added
together
make
i
believe
this
to
be
an
error
no
matter
you
cannot
get
a
habit
sodden
shakespearite
to
cipher
up
his
materials
upon
any
other
basis
with
the
baconian
it
is
different
if
you
place
before
him
the
above
figures
and
set
him
to
adding
them
up
he
will
never
in
any
case
get
more
than
out
of
them
and
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
he
will
get
just
the
proper
let
me
try
to
illustrate
the
two
systems
in
a
simple
and
homely
way
calculated
to
bring
the
idea
within
the
grasp
of
the
ignorant
and
unintelligent
we
will
suppose
a
case
take
a
lap
bred
house
fed
uneducated
inexperienced
kitten
take
a
rugged
old
tom
that's
scarred
from
stem
to
rudder
post
with
the
memorials
of
strenuous
experience
and
is
so
cultured
so
educated
so
limitlessly
erudite
that
one
may
say
of
him
all
cat
knowledge
is
his
province
also
take
a
mouse
lock
the
three
up
in
a
holeless
crackless
exitless
prison
cell
wait
half
an
hour
then
open
the
cell
introduce
a
shakespearite
and
a
baconian
and
let
them
cipher
and
assume
the
mouse
is
missing
the
question
to
be
decided
is
where
is
it
you
can
guess
both
verdicts
beforehand
one
verdict
will
say
the
kitten
contains
the
mouse
the
other
will
as
certainly
say
the
mouse
is
in
the
tom
cat
the
shakespearite
will
reason
like
this
that
is
not
my
word
it
is
his
he
will
say
the
kitten
may
have
been
attending
school
when
nobody
was
noticing
therefore
we
are
warranted
in
assuming
that
it
did
so
also
it
could
have
been
training
in
a
court
clerk's
office
when
no
one
was
noticing
since
that
could
have
happened
we
are
justified
in
assuming
that
it
did
happen
it
could
have
studied
catology
in
a
garret
when
no
one
was
noticing
therefore
it
did
it
could
have
attended
cat
assizes
on
the
shed
roof
nights
for
recreation
when
no
one
was
noticing
and
have
harvested
a
knowledge
of
cat
court
forms
and
cat
lawyer
talk
in
that
way
it
could
have
done
it
therefore
without
a
doubt
it
did
it
could
have
gone
soldiering
with
a
war
tribe
when
no
one
was
noticing
and
learned
soldier
wiles
and
soldier
ways
and
what
to
do
with
a
mouse
when
opportunity
offers
the
plain
inference
therefore
is
that
that
is
what
it
did
since
all
these
manifold
things
could
have
occurred
we
have
every
right
to
believe
they
did
occur
these
patiently
and
painstakingly
accumulated
vast
acquirements
and
competences
needed
but
one
thing
more
opportunity
to
convert
themselves
into
triumphant
action
the
opportunity
came
we
have
the
result
beyond
shadow
of
question
the
mouse
is
in
the
kitten
it
is
proper
to
remark
that
when
we
of
the
three
cults
plant
a
we
think
we
may
assume
we
expect
it
under
careful
watering
and
fertilizing
and
tending
to
grow
up
into
a
strong
and
hardy
and
weather
defying
there
isn't
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
at
last
and
it
usually
happens
we
know
what
the
baconian's
verdict
would
be
there
is
not
a
rag
of
evidence
that
the
kitten
has
had
any
training
any
education
any
experience
qualifying
it
for
the
present
occasion
or
is
indeed
equipped
for
any
achievement
above
lifting
such
unclaimed
milk
as
comes
its
way
but
there
is
abundant
evidence
unassailable
proof
in
fact
that
the
other
animal
is
equipped
to
the
last
detail
with
every
qualification
necessary
for
the
event
without
shadow
of
doubt
the
tom
cat
contains
the
mouse
vi
when
shakespeare
died
in
great
literary
productions
attributed
to
him
as
author
had
been
before
the
london
world
and
in
high
favor
for
twenty
four
years
yet
his
death
was
not
an
event
it
made
no
stir
it
attracted
no
attention
apparently
his
eminent
literary
contemporaries
did
not
realize
that
a
celebrated
poet
had
passed
from
their
midst
perhaps
they
knew
a
play
actor
of
minor
rank
had
disappeared
but
did
not
regard
him
as
the
author
of
his
works
we
are
justified
in
assuming
this
his
death
was
not
even
an
event
in
the
little
town
of
stratford
does
this
mean
that
in
stratford
he
was
not
regarded
as
a
celebrity
of
any
kind
we
are
privileged
to
assume
no
we
are
indeed
obliged
to
assume
that
such
was
the
case
he
had
spent
the
first
twenty
two
or
twenty
three
years
of
his
life
there
and
of
course
knew
everybody
and
was
known
by
everybody
of
that
day
in
the
town
including
the
dogs
and
the
cats
and
the
horses
he
had
spent
the
last
five
or
six
years
of
his
life
there
diligently
trading
in
every
big
and
little
thing
that
had
money
in
it
so
we
are
compelled
to
assume
that
many
of
the
folk
there
in
those
said
latter
days
knew
him
personally
and
the
rest
by
sight
and
hearsay
but
not
as
a
celebrity
apparently
not
for
everybody
soon
forgot
to
remember
any
contact
with
him
or
any
incident
connected
with
him
the
dozens
of
townspeople
still
alive
who
had
known
of
him
or
known
about
him
in
the
first
twenty
three
years
of
his
life
were
in
the
same
unremembering
condition
if
they
knew
of
any
incident
connected
with
that
period
of
his
life
they
didn't
tell
about
it
would
they
if
they
had
been
asked
it
is
most
likely
were
they
asked
it
is
pretty
apparent
that
they
were
not
why
weren't
they
it
is
a
very
plausible
guess
that
nobody
there
or
elsewhere
was
interested
to
know
for
seven
years
after
shakespeare's
death
nobody
seems
to
have
been
interested
in
him
then
the
quarto
was
published
and
ben
jonson
awoke
out
of
his
long
indifference
and
sang
a
song
of
praise
and
put
it
in
the
front
of
the
book
then
silence
fell
again
for
sixty
years
then
inquiries
into
shakespeare's
stratford
life
began
to
be
made
of
stratfordians
of
stratfordians
who
had
known
shakespeare
or
had
seen
him
no
then
of
stratfordians
who
had
seen
people
who
had
known
or
seen
people
who
had
seen
shakespeare
no
apparently
the
inquires
were
only
made
of
stratfordians
who
were
not
stratfordians
of
shakespeare's
day
but
later
comers
and
what
they
had
learned
had
come
to
them
from
persons
who
had
not
seen
shakespeare
and
what
they
had
learned
was
not
claimed
as
fact
but
only
as
legend
dim
and
fading
and
indefinite
legend
legend
of
the
calf
slaughtering
rank
and
not
worth
remembering
either
as
history
or
fiction
has
it
ever
happened
before
or
since
that
a
celebrated
person
who
had
spent
exactly
half
of
a
fairly
long
life
in
the
village
where
he
was
born
and
reared
was
able
to
slip
out
of
this
world
and
leave
that
village
voiceless
and
gossipless
behind
him
utterly
voiceless
utterly
gossipless
and
permanently
so
i
don't
believe
it
has
happened
in
any
case
except
shakespeare's
and
couldn't
and
wouldn't
have
happened
in
his
case
if
he
had
been
regarded
as
a
celebrity
at
the
time
of
his
death
when
i
examine
my
own
case
but
let
us
do
that
and
see
if
it
will
not
be
recognizable
as
exhibiting
a
condition
of
things
quite
likely
to
result
most
likely
to
result
indeed
substantially
sure
to
result
in
the
case
of
a
celebrated
person
a
benefactor
of
the
human
race
like
me
my
parents
brought
me
to
the
village
of
hannibal
missouri
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
when
i
was
two
and
a
half
years
old
i
entered
school
at
five
years
of
age
and
drifted
from
one
school
to
another
in
the
village
during
nine
and
a
half
years
then
my
father
died
leaving
his
family
in
exceedingly
straitened
circumstances
wherefore
my
book
education
came
to
a
standstill
forever
and
i
became
a
printer's
apprentice
on
board
and
clothes
and
when
the
clothes
failed
i
got
a
hymn
book
in
place
of
them
this
for
summer
wear
probably
i
lived
in
hannibal
fifteen
and
a
half
years
altogether
then
ran
away
according
to
the
custom
of
persons
who
are
intending
to
become
celebrated
i
never
lived
there
afterward
four
years
later
i
became
a
cub
on
a
mississippi
steamboat
in
the
st
louis
and
new
orleans
trade
and
after
a
year
and
a
half
of
hard
study
and
hard
work
the
u
s
inspectors
rigorously
examined
me
through
a
couple
of
long
sittings
and
decided
that
i
knew
every
inch
of
the
mississippi
thirteen
hundred
miles
in
the
dark
and
in
the
day
as
well
as
a
baby
knows
the
way
to
its
mother's
paps
day
or
night
so
they
licensed
me
as
a
pilot
knighted
me
so
to
speak
and
i
rose
up
clothed
with
authority
a
responsible
servant
of
the
united
states
government
now
then
shakespeare
died
young
he
was
only
fifty
two
he
had
lived
in
his
native
village
twenty
six
years
or
about
that
he
died
celebrated
if
you
believe
everything
you
read
in
the
books
yet
when
he
died
nobody
there
or
elsewhere
took
any
notice
of
it
and
for
sixty
years
afterward
no
townsman
remembered
to
say
anything
about
him
or
about
his
life
in
stratford
when
the
inquirer
came
at
last
he
got
but
one
fact
no
legend
and
got
that
one
at
second
hand
from
a
person
who
had
only
heard
it
as
a
rumor
and
didn't
claim
copyright
in
it
as
a
production
of
his
own
he
couldn't
very
well
for
its
date
antedated
his
own
birth
date
but
necessarily
a
number
of
persons
were
still
alive
in
stratford
who
in
the
days
of
their
youth
had
seen
shakespeare
nearly
every
day
in
the
last
five
years
of
his
life
and
they
would
have
been
able
to
tell
that
inquirer
some
first
hand
things
about
him
if
he
had
in
those
last
days
been
a
celebrity
and
therefore
a
person
of
interest
to
the
villagers
why
did
not
the
inquirer
hunt
them
up
and
interview
them
wasn't
it
worth
while
wasn't
the
matter
of
sufficient
consequence
had
the
inquirer
an
engagement
to
see
a
dog
fight
and
couldn't
spare
the
time
it
all
seems
to
mean
that
he
never
had
any
literary
celebrity
there
or
elsewhere
and
no
considerable
repute
as
actor
and
manager
now
then
i
am
away
along
in
life
my
seventy
third
year
being
already
well
behind
me
yet
sixteen
of
my
hannibal
schoolmates
are
still
alive
today
and
can
tell
and
do
tell
inquirers
dozens
and
dozens
of
incidents
of
their
young
lives
and
mine
together
things
that
happened
to
us
in
the
morning
of
life
in
the
blossom
of
our
youth
in
the
good
days
the
dear
days
the
days
when
we
went
gipsying
a
long
time
ago
most
of
them
creditable
to
me
too
one
child
to
whom
i
paid
court
when
she
was
five
years
old
and
i
eight
still
lives
in
hannibal
and
she
visited
me
last
summer
traversing
the
necessary
ten
or
twelve
hundred
miles
of
railroad
without
damage
to
her
patience
or
to
her
old
young
vigor
another
little
lassie
to
whom
i
paid
attention
in
hannibal
when
she
was
nine
years
old
and
i
the
same
is
still
alive
in
london
and
hale
and
hearty
just
as
i
am
and
on
the
few
surviving
steamboats
those
lingering
ghosts
and
remembrancers
of
great
fleets
that
plied
the
big
river
in
the
beginning
of
my
water
career
which
is
exactly
as
long
ago
as
the
whole
invoice
of
the
life
years
of
shakespeare
numbers
there
are
still
findable
two
or
three
river
pilots
who
saw
me
do
creditable
things
in
those
ancient
days
and
several
white
headed
engineers
and
several
roustabouts
and
mates
and
several
deck
hands
who
used
to
heave
the
lead
for
me
and
send
up
on
the
still
night
the
six
feet
scant
that
made
me
shudder
and
the
m
a
r
k
twain
that
took
the
shudder
away
and
presently
the
darling
by
the
d
e
e
p
four
that
lifted
me
to
heaven
for
joy
they
know
about
me
and
can
tell
and
so
do
printers
from
st
louis
to
new
york
and
so
do
newspaper
reporters
from
nevada
to
san
francisco
and
so
do
the
police
if
shakespeare
had
really
been
celebrated
like
me
stratford
could
have
told
things
about
him
and
if
my
experience
goes
for
anything
they'd
have
done
it
four
fathoms
twenty
four
feet
vii
if
i
had
under
my
superintendence
a
controversy
appointed
to
decide
whether
shakespeare
wrote
shakespeare
or
not
i
believe
i
would
place
before
the
debaters
only
the
one
question
was
shakespeare
ever
a
practicing
lawyer
and
leave
everything
else
out
it
is
maintained
that
the
man
who
wrote
the
plays
was
not
merely
myriad
minded
but
also
myriad
accomplished
that
he
not
only
knew
some
thousands
of
things
about
human
life
in
all
its
shades
and
grades
and
about
the
hundred
arts
and
trades
and
crafts
and
professions
which
men
busy
themselves
in
but
that
he
could
talk
about
the
men
and
their
grades
and
trades
accurately
making
no
mistakes
maybe
it
is
so
but
have
the
experts
spoken
or
is
it
only
tom
dick
and
harry
does
the
exhibit
stand
upon
wide
and
loose
and
eloquent
generalizing
which
is
not
evidence
and
not
proof
or
upon
details
particulars
statistics
illustrations
demonstrations
experts
of
unchallengeable
authority
have
testified
definitely
as
to
only
one
of
shakespeare's
multifarious
craft
equipments
so
far
as
my
recollections
of
shakespeare
bacon
talk
abide
with
me
his
law
equipment
i
do
not
remember
that
wellington
or
napoleon
ever
examined
shakespeare's
battles
and
sieges
and
strategies
and
then
decided
and
established
for
good
and
all
that
they
were
militarily
flawless
i
do
not
remember
that
any
nelson
or
drake
or
cook
ever
examined
his
seamanship
and
said
it
showed
profound
and
accurate
familiarity
with
that
art
i
don't
remember
that
any
king
or
prince
or
duke
has
ever
testified
that
shakespeare
was
letter
perfect
in
his
handling
of
royal
court
manners
and
the
talk
and
manners
of
aristocracies
i
don't
remember
that
any
illustrious
latinist
or
grecian
or
frenchman
or
spaniard
or
italian
has
proclaimed
him
a
past
master
in
those
languages
i
don't
remember
well
i
don't
remember
that
there
is
testimony
great
testimony
imposing
testimony
unanswerable
and
unattackable
testimony
as
to
any
of
shakespeare's
hundred
specialties
except
one
the
law
other
things
change
with
time
and
the
student
cannot
trace
back
with
certainty
the
changes
that
various
trades
and
their
processes
and
technicalities
have
undergone
in
the
long
stretch
of
a
century
or
two
and
find
out
what
their
processes
and
technicalities
were
in
those
early
days
but
with
the
law
it
is
different
it
is
mile
stoned
and
documented
all
the
way
back
and
the
master
of
that
wonderful
trade
that
complex
and
intricate
trade
that
awe
compelling
trade
has
competent
ways
of
knowing
whether
shakespeare
law
is
good
law
or
not
and
whether
his
law
court
procedure
is
correct
or
not
and
whether
his
legal
shop
talk
is
the
shop
talk
of
a
veteran
practitioner
or
only
a
machine
made
counterfeit
of
it
gathered
from
books
and
from
occasional
loiterings
in
westminster
richard
h
dana
served
two
years
before
the
mast
and
had
every
experience
that
falls
to
the
lot
of
the
sailor
before
the
mast
of
our
day
his
sailor
talk
flows
from
his
pen
with
the
sure
touch
and
the
ease
and
confidence
of
a
person
who
has
lived
what
he
is
talking
about
not
gathered
it
from
books
and
random
listenings
hear
him
having
hove
short
cast
off
the
gaskets
and
made
the
bunt
of
each
sail
fast
by
the
jigger
with
a
man
on
each
yard
at
the
word
the
whole
canvas
of
the
ship
was
loosed
and
with
the
greatest
rapidity
possible
everything
was
sheeted
home
and
hoisted
up
the
anchor
tripped
and
cat
headed
and
the
ship
under
headway
again
the
royal
yards
were
all
crossed
at
once
and
royals
and
sky
sails
set
and
as
we
had
the
wind
free
the
booms
were
run
out
and
all
were
aloft
active
as
cats
laying
out
on
the
yards
and
booms
reeving
the
studding
sail
gear
and
sail
after
sail
the
captain
piled
upon
her
until
she
was
covered
with
canvas
her
sails
looking
like
a
great
white
cloud
resting
upon
a
black
speck
once
more
a
race
in
the
pacific
our
antagonist
was
in
her
best
trim
being
clear
of
the
point
the
breeze
became
stiff
and
the
royal
masts
bent
under
our
sails
but
we
would
not
take
them
in
until
we
saw
three
boys
spring
into
the
rigging
of
the
california
then
they
were
all
furled
at
once
but
with
orders
to
our
boys
to
stay
aloft
at
the
top
gallant
mast
heads
and
loose
them
again
at
the
word
it
was
my
duty
to
furl
the
fore
royal
and
while
standing
by
to
loose
it
again
i
had
a
fine
view
of
the
scene
from
where
i
stood
the
two
vessels
seemed
nothing
but
spars
and
sails
while
their
narrow
decks
far
below
slanting
over
by
the
force
of
the
wind
aloft
appeared
hardly
capable
of
supporting
the
great
fabrics
raised
upon
them
the
california
was
to
windward
of
us
and
had
every
advantage
yet
while
the
breeze
was
stiff
we
held
our
own
as
soon
as
it
began
to
slacken
she
ranged
a
little
ahead
and
the
order
was
given
to
loose
the
royals
in
an
instant
the
gaskets
were
off
and
the
bunt
dropped
sheet
home
the
fore
royal
weather
sheet's

hoist

sir

aye

all
clear
taut

belay
well
the
lee

haul
taut
to
windward
and
the
royals
are
set
what
would
the
captain
of
any
sailing
vessel
of
our
time
say
to
that
he
would
say
the
man
that
wrote
that
didn't
learn
his
trade
out
of
a
book
he
has
been
there
but
would
this
same
captain
be
competent
to
sit
in
judgment
upon
shakespeare's
seamanship
considering
the
changes
in
ships
and
ship
talk
that
have
necessarily
taken
place
unrecorded
unremembered
and
lost
to
history
in
the
last
three
hundred
years
it
is
my
conviction
that
shakespeare's
sailor
talk
would
be
choctaw
to
him
for
instance
from
the
tempest
master

that
will
do
for
the
present
let
us
yare
a
little
now
for
a
change
if
a
man
should
write
a
book
and
in
it
make
one
of
his
characters
say
here
devil
empty
the
quoins
into
the
standing
galley
and
the
imposing
stone
into
the
hell
box
assemble
the
comps
around
the
frisket
and
let
them
jeff
for
takes
and
be
quick
about
it
i
should
recognize
a
mistake
or
two
in
the
phrasing
and
would
know
that
the
writer
was
only
a
printer
theoretically
not
practically
i
have
been
a
quartz
miner
in
the
silver
regions
a
pretty
hard
life
i
know
all
the
palaver
of
that
business
i
know
all
about
discovery
claims
and
the
subordinate
claims
i
know
all
about
lodes
ledges
outcroppings
dips
spurs
angles
shafts
drifts
inclines
levels
tunnels
air
shafts
horses
clay
casings
granite
casings
quartz
mills
and
their
batteries
arastras
and
how
to
charge
them
with
quicksilver
and
sulphate
of
copper
and
how
to
clean
them
up
and
how
to
reduce
the
resulting
amalgam
in
the
retorts
and
how
to
cast
the
bullion
into
pigs
and
finally
i
know
how
to
screen
tailings
and
also
how
to
hunt
for
something
less
robust
to
do
and
find
it
i
know
the
argot
of
the
quartz
mining
and
milling
industry
familiarly
and
so
whenever
bret
harte
introduces
that
industry
into
a
story
the
first
time
one
of
his
miners
opens
his
mouth
i
recognize
from
his
phrasing
that
harte
got
the
phrasing
by
listening
like
shakespeare
i
mean
the
stratford
one
not
by
experience
no
one
can
talk
the
quartz
dialect
correctly
without
learning
it
with
pick
and
shovel
and
drill
and
fuse
i
have
been
a
surface
miner
gold
and
i
know
all
its
mysteries
and
the
dialect
that
belongs
with
them
and
whenever
harte
introduces
that
industry
into
a
story
i
know
by
the
phrasing
of
his
characters
that
neither
he
nor
they
have
ever
served
that
trade
i
have
been
a
pocket
miner
a
sort
of
gold
mining
not
findable
in
any
but
one
little
spot
in
the
world
so
far
as
i
know
i
know
how
with
horn
and
water
to
find
the
trail
of
a
pocket
and
trace
it
step
by
step
and
stage
by
stage
up
the
mountain
to
its
source
and
find
the
compact
little
nest
of
yellow
metal
reposing
in
its
secret
home
under
the
ground
i
know
the
language
of
that
trade
that
capricious
trade
that
fascinating
buried
treasure
trade
and
can
catch
any
writer
who
tries
to
use
it
without
having
learned
it
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
and
the
labor
of
his
hands
i
know
several
other
trades
and
the
argot
that
goes
with
them
and
whenever
a
person
tries
to
talk
the
talk
peculiar
to
any
of
them
without
having
learned
it
at
its
source
i
can
trap
him
always
before
he
gets
far
on
his
road
and
so
as
i
have
already
remarked
if
i
were
required
to
superintend
a
bacon
shakespeare
controversy
i
would
narrow
the
matter
down
to
a
single
question
the
only
one
so
far
as
the
previous
controversies
have
informed
me
concerning
which
illustrious
experts
of
unimpeachable
competency
have
testified
was
the
author
of
shakespeare's
works
a
lawyer
a
lawyer
deeply
read
and
of
limitless
experience
i
would
put
aside
the
guesses
and
surmises
and
perhapses
and
might
have
beens
and
could
have
beens
and
must
have
beens
and
we
are
justified
in
presumings
and
the
rest
of
those
vague
specters
and
shadows
and
indefinitenesses
and
stand
or
fall
win
or
lose
by
the
verdict
rendered
by
the
jury
upon
that
single
question
if
the
verdict
was
yes
i
should
feel
quite
convinced
that
the
stratford
shakespeare
the
actor
manager
and
trader
who
died
so
obscure
so
forgotten
so
destitute
of
even
village
consequence
that
sixty
years
afterward
no
fellow
citizen
and
friend
of
his
later
days
remembered
to
tell
anything
about
him
did
not
write
the
works
chapter
xiii
of
the
shakespeare
problem
restated
bears
the
heading
shakespeare
as
a
lawyer
and
comprises
some
fifty
pages
of
expert
testimony
with
comments
thereon
and
i
will
copy
the
first
nine
as
being
sufficient
all
by
themselves
as
it
seems
to
me
to
settle
the
question
which
i
have
conceived
to
be
the
master
key
to
the
shakespeare
bacon
puzzle
viii
shakespeare
as
a
lawyer
the
plays
and
poems
of
shakespeare
supply
ample
evidence
that
their
author
not
only
had
a
very
extensive
and
accurate
knowledge
of
law
but
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
manners
and
customs
of
members
of
the
inns
of
court
and
with
legal
life
generally
while
novelists
and
dramatists
are
constantly
making
mistakes
as
to
the
laws
of
marriage
of
wills
and
inheritance
to
shakespeare's
law
lavishly
as
he
expounds
it
there
can
neither
be
demurrer
nor
bill
of
exceptions
nor
writ
of
error
such
was
the
testimony
borne
by
one
of
the
most
distinguished
lawyers
of
the
nineteenth
century
who
was
raised
to
the
high
office
of
lord
chief
justice
in
and
subsequently
became
lord
chancellor
its
weight
will
doubtless
be
more
appreciated
by
lawyers
than
by
laymen
for
only
lawyers
know
how
impossible
it
is
for
those
who
have
not
served
an
apprenticeship
to
the
law
to
avoid
displaying
their
ignorance
if
they
venture
to
employ
legal
terms
and
to
discuss
legal
doctrines
there
is
nothing
so
dangerous
wrote
lord
campbell
as
for
one
not
of
the
craft
to
tamper
with
our
freemasonry
a
layman
is
certain
to
betray
himself
by
using
some
expression
which
a
lawyer
would
never
employ
mr
sidney
lee
himself
supplies
us
with
an
example
of
this
he
writes
p
on
february
shakespeare
obtained
judgment
from
a
jury
against
addenbroke
for
the
payment
of
no
and
no
costs
now
a
lawyer
would
never
have
spoken
of
obtaining
judgment
from
a
jury
for
it
is
the
function
of
a
jury
not
to
deliver
judgment
which
is
the
prerogative
of
the
court
but
to
find
a
verdict
on
the
facts
the
error
is
indeed
a
venial
one
but
it
is
just
one
of
those
little
things
which
at
once
enable
a
lawyer
to
know
if
the
writer
is
a
layman
or
one
of
the
craft
but
when
a
layman
ventures
to
plunge
deeply
into
legal
subjects
he
is
naturally
apt
to
make
an
exhibition
of
his
incompetence
let
a
non
professional
man
however
acute
writes
lord
campbell
again
presume
to
talk
law
or
to
draw
illustrations
from
legal
science
in
discussing
other
subjects
and
he
will
speedily
fall
into
laughable
absurdity
and
what
does
the
same
high
authority
say
about
shakespeare
he
had
a
deep
technical
knowledge
of
the
law
and
an
easy
familiarity
with
some
of
the
most
abstruse
proceedings
in
english
jurisprudence
and
again
whenever
he
indulges
this
propensity
he
uniformly
lays
down
good
law
of
henry
iv
part
he
says
if
lord
eldon
could
be
supposed
to
have
written
the
play
i
do
not
see
how
he
could
be
chargeable
with
having
forgotten
any
of
his
law
while
writing
it
charles
and
mary
cowden
clarke
speak
of
the
marvelous
intimacy
which
he
displays
with
legal
terms
his
frequent
adoption
of
them
in
illustration
and
his
curiously
technical
knowledge
of
their
form
and
force
malone
himself
a
lawyer
wrote
his
knowledge
of
legal
terms
is
not
merely
such
as
might
be
acquired
by
the
casual
observation
of
even
his
all
comprehending
mind
it
has
the
appearance
of
technical
skill
another
lawyer
and
well
known
shakespearean
richard
grant
white
says
no
dramatist
of
the
time
not
even
beaumont
who
was
the
younger
son
of
a
judge
of
the
common
pleas
and
who
after
studying
in
the
inns
of
court
abandoned
law
for
the
drama
used
legal
phrases
with
shakespeare's
readiness
and
exactness
and
the
significance
of
this
fact
is
heightened
by
another
that
it
is
only
to
the
language
of
the
law
that
he
exhibits
this
inclination
the
phrases
peculiar
to
other
occupations
serve
him
on
rare
occasions
by
way
of
description
comparison
or
illustration
generally
when
something
in
the
scene
suggests
them
but
legal
phrases
flow
from
his
pen
as
part
of
his
vocabulary
and
parcel
of
his
thought
take
the
word
purchase
for
instance
which
in
ordinary
use
means
to
acquire
by
giving
value
but
applies
in
law
to
all
legal
modes
of
obtaining
property
except
by
inheritance
or
descent
and
in
this
peculiar
sense
the
word
occurs
five
times
in
shakespeare's
thirty
four
plays
and
only
in
one
single
instance
in
the
fifty
four
plays
of
beaumont
and
fletcher
it
has
been
suggested
that
it
was
in
attendance
upon
the
courts
in
london
that
he
picked
up
his
legal
vocabulary
but
this
supposition
not
only
fails
to
account
for
shakespeare's
peculiar
freedom
and
exactness
in
the
use
of
that
phraseology
it
does
not
even
place
him
in
the
way
of
learning
those
terms
his
use
of
which
is
most
remarkable
which
are
not
such
as
he
would
have
heard
at
ordinary
proceedings
at
nisi
prius
but
such
as
refer
to
the
tenure
or
transfer
of
real
property
fine
and
recovery
statutes
merchant
purchase
indenture
tenure
double
voucher
fee
simple
fee
farm
remainder
reversion
forfeiture
etc
this
conveyancer's
jargon
could
not
have
been
picked
up
by
hanging
round
the
courts
of
law
in
london
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
when
suits
as
to
the
title
of
real
property
were
comparatively
rare
and
besides
shakespeare
uses
his
law
just
as
freely
in
his
first
plays
written
in
his
first
london
years
as
in
those
produced
at
a
later
period
just
as
exactly
too
for
the
correctness
and
propriety
with
which
these
terms
are
introduced
have
compelled
the
admiration
of
a
chief
justice
and
a
lord
chancellor
senator
davis
wrote
we
seem
to
have
something
more
than
a
sciolist's
temerity
of
indulgence
in
the
terms
of
an
unfamiliar
art
no
legal
solecisms
will
be
found
the
abstrusest
elements
of
the
common
law
are
impressed
into
a
disciplined
service
over
and
over
again
where
such
knowledge
is
unexampled
in
writers
unlearned
in
the
law
shakespeare
appears
in
perfect
possession
of
it
in
the
law
of
real
property
its
rules
of
tenure
and
descents
its
entails
its
fines
and
recoveries
their
vouchers
and
double
vouchers
in
the
procedure
of
the

the
method
of
bringing
writs
and
arrests
the
nature
of

the
rules
of
pleading
the
law
of
escapes
and
of
contempt
of

in
the
principles
of

both
technical
and
philosophical
in
the
distinction
between
the
temporal
and
spiritual
tribunals
in
the

of

in

in

presumption
of
legitimacy
in
the
learning
of
the
law
of
prerogative
in
the
inalienable
character
of
the
crown
this
mastership
appears
with
surprising
authority
to
all
this
testimony
and
there
is
much
more
which
i
have
not
cited
may
now
be
added
that
of
a
great
lawyer
of
our
own
times
viz
sir
james
plaisted
wilde
q
c
created
a
baron
of
the
exchequer
in
promoted
to
the
post
of
judge
ordinary
and
judge
of
the
courts
of
probate
and
divorce
in
and
better
known
to
the
world
as
lord
penzance
to
which
dignity
he
was
raised
in
lord
penzance
as
all
lawyers
know
and
as
the
late
mr
inderwick
k
c
has
testified
was
one
of
the
first
legal
authorities
of
his
day
famous
for
his
remarkable
grasp
of
legal
principles
and
endowed
by
nature
with
a
remarkable
facility
for
marshaling
facts
and
for
a
clear
expression
of
his
views
lord
penzance
speaks
of
shakespeare's
perfect
familiarity
with
not
only
the
principles
axioms
and
maxims
but
the
technicalities
of
english
law
a
knowledge
so
perfect
and
intimate
that
he
was
never
incorrect
and
never
at
fault
the
mode
in
which
this
knowledge
was
pressed
into
service
on
all
occasions
to
express
his
meaning
and
illustrate
his
thoughts
was
quite
unexampled
he
seems
to
have
had
a
special
pleasure
in
his
complete
and
ready
mastership
of
it
in
all
its
branches
as
manifested
in
the
plays
this
legal
knowledge
and
learning
had
therefore
a
special
character
which
places
it
on
a
wholly
different
footing
from
the
rest
of
the
multifarious
knowledge
which
is
exhibited
in
page
after
page
of
the
plays
at
every
turn
and
point
at
which
the
author
required
a
metaphor
simile
or
illustration
his
mind
ever
turned
first
to
the
law
he
seems
almost
to
have
thought
in
legal
phrases
the
commonest
of
legal
expressions
were
ever
at
the
end
of
his
pen
in
description
or
illustration
that
he
should
have
descanted
in
lawyer
language
when
he
had
a
forensic
subject
in
hand
such
as
shylock's
bond
was
to
be
expected
but
the
knowledge
of
law
in
shakespeare
was
exhibited
in
a
far
different
manner
it
protruded
itself
on
all
occasions
appropriate
or
inappropriate
and
mingled
itself
with
strains
of
thought
widely
divergent
from
forensic
subjects
again
to
acquire
a
perfect
familiarity
with
legal
principles
and
an
accurate
and
ready
use
of
the
technical
terms
and
phrases
not
only
of
the
conveyancer's
office
but
of
the
pleader's
chambers
and
the
courts
at
westminster
nothing
short
of
employment
in
some
career
involving
constant
contact
with
legal
questions
and
general
legal
work
would
be
requisite
but
a
continuous
employment
involves
the
element
of
time
and
time
was
just
what
the
manager
of
two
theaters
had
not
at
his
disposal
in
what
portion
of
shakespeare's
i
e
shakspere's
career
would
it
be
possible
to
point
out
that
time
could
be
found
for
the
interposition
of
a
legal
employment
in
the
chambers
or
offices
of
practicing
lawyers
stratfordians
as
is
well
known
casting
about
for
some
possible
explanation
of
shakespeare's
extraordinary
knowledge
of
law
have
made
the
suggestion
that
shakespeare
might
conceivably
have
been
a
clerk
in
an
attorney's
office
before
he
came
to
london
mr
collier
wrote
to
lord
campbell
to
ask
his
opinion
as
to
the
probability
of
this
being
true
his
answer
was
as
follows
you
require
us
to
believe
implicitly
a
fact
of
which
if
true
positive
and
irrefragable
evidence
in
his
own
handwriting
might
have
been
forthcoming
to
establish
it
not
having
been
actually
enrolled
as
an
attorney
neither
the
records
of
the
local
court
at
stratford
nor
of
the
superior
courts
at
westminster
would
present
his
name
as
being
concerned
in
any
suit
as
an
attorney
but
it
might
reasonably
have
been
expected
that
there
would
be
deeds
or
wills
witnessed
by
him
still
extant
and
after
a
very
diligent
search
none
such
can
be
discovered
upon
this
lord
penzance
comments
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
lord
campbell
was
right
in
this
no
young
man
could
have
been
at
work
in
an
attorney's
office
without
being
called
upon
continually
to
act
as
a
witness
and
in
many
other
ways
leaving
traces
of
his
work
and
name
there
is
not
a
single
fact
or
incident
in
all
that
is
known
of
shakespeare
even
by
rumor
or
tradition
which
supports
this
notion
of
a
clerkship
and
after
much
argument
and
surmise
which
has
been
indulged
in
on
this
subject
we
may
i
think
safely
put
the
notion
on
one
side
for
no
less
an
authority
than
mr
grant
white
says
finally
that
the
idea
of
his
having
been
clerk
to
an
attorney
has
been
blown
to
pieces
it
is
altogether
characteristic
of
mr
churton
collins
that
he
nevertheless
adopts
this
exploded
myth
that
shakespeare
was
in
early
life
employed
as
a
clerk
in
an
attorney's
office
may
be
correct
at
stratford
there
was
by
royal
charter
a
court
of
record
sitting
every
fortnight
with
six
attorneys
besides
the
town
clerk
belonging
to
it
and
it
is
certainly
not
straining
probability
to
suppose
that
the
young
shakespeare
may
have
had
employment
in
one
of
them
there
is
it
is
true
no
tradition
to
this
effect
but
such
traditions
as
we
have
about
shakespeare's
occupation
between
the
time
of
leaving
school
and
going
to
london
are
so
loose
and
baseless
that
no
confidence
can
be
placed
in
them
it
is
to
say
the
least
more
probable
that
he
was
in
an
attorney's
office
than
that
he
was
a
butcher
killing
calves
in
a
high
style
and
making
speeches
over
them
this
is
a
charming
specimen
of
stratfordian
argument
there
is
as
we
have
seen
a
very
old
tradition
that
shakespeare
was
a
butcher's
apprentice
john
dowdall
who
made
a
tour
in
warwickshire
in
testifies
to
it
as
coming
from
the
old
clerk
who
showed
him
over
the
church
and
it
is
unhesitatingly
accepted
as
true
by
mr
halliwell
phillipps
vol
i
p
and
vol
ii
pp
mr
sidney
lee
sees
nothing
improbable
in
it
and
it
is
supported
by
aubrey
who
must
have
written
his
account
some
time
before
when
his
manuscript
was
completed
of
the
attorney's
clerk
hypothesis
on
the
other
hand
there
is
not
the
faintest
vestige
of
a
tradition
it
has
been
evolved
out
of
the
fertile
imaginations
of
embarrassed
stratfordians
seeking
for
some
explanation
of
the
stratford
rustic's
marvelous
acquaintance
with
law
and
legal
terms
and
legal
life
but
mr
churton
collins
has
not
the
least
hesitation
in
throwing
over
the
tradition
which
has
the
warrant
of
antiquity
and
setting
up
in
its
stead
this
ridiculous
invention
for
which
not
only
is
there
no
shred
of
positive
evidence
but
which
as
lord
campbell
and
lord
penzance
point
out
is
really
put
out
of
court
by
the
negative
evidence
since
no
young
man
could
have
been
at
work
in
an
attorney's
office
without
being
called
upon
continually
to
act
as
a
witness
and
in
many
other
ways
leaving
traces
of
his
work
and
name
and
as
mr
edwards
further
points
out
since
the
day
when
lord
campbell's
book
was
published
between
forty
and
fifty
years
ago
every
old
deed
or
will
to
say
nothing
of
other
legal
papers
dated
during
the
period
of
william
shakespeare's
youth
has
been
scrutinized
over
half
a
dozen
shires
and
not
one
signature
of
the
young
man
has
been
found
moreover
if
shakespeare
had
served
as
clerk
in
an
attorney's
office
it
is
clear
that
he
must
have
so
served
for
a
considerable
period
in
order
to
have
gained
if
indeed
it
is
credible
that
he
could
have
so
gained
his
remarkable
knowledge
of
the
law
can
we
then
for
a
moment
believe
that
if
this
had
been
so
tradition
would
have
been
absolutely
silent
on
the
matter
that
dowdall's
old
clerk
over
eighty
years
of
age
should
have
never
heard
of
it
though
he
was
sure
enough
about
the
butcher's
apprentice
and
that
all
the
other
ancient
witnesses
should
be
in
similar
ignorance
but
such
are
the
methods
of
stratfordian
controversy
tradition
is
to
be
scouted
when
it
is
found
inconvenient
but
cited
as
irrefragable
truth
when
it
suits
the
case
shakespeare
of
stratford
was
the
author
of
the
plays
and
poems
but
the
author
of
the
plays
and
poems
could
not
have
been
a
butcher's
apprentice
away
therefore
with
tradition
but
the
author
of
the
plays
and
poems
must
have
had
a
very
large
and
a
very
accurate
knowledge
of
the
law
therefore
shakespeare
of
stratford
must
have
been
an
attorney's
clerk
the
method
is
simplicity
itself
by
similar
reasoning
shakespeare
has
been
made
a
country
schoolmaster
a
soldier
a
physician
a
printer
and
a
good
many
other
things
besides
according
to
the
inclination
and
the
exigencies
of
the
commentator
it
would
not
be
in
the
least
surprising
to
find
that
he
was
studying
latin
as
a
schoolmaster
and
law
in
an
attorney's
office
at
the
same
time
however
we
must
do
mr
collins
the
justice
of
saying
that
he
has
fully
recognized
what
is
indeed
tolerably
obvious
that
shakespeare
must
have
had
a
sound
legal
training
it
may
of
course
be
urged
he
writes
that
shakespeare's
knowledge
of
medicine
and
particularly
that
branch
of
it
which
related
to
morbid
psychology
is
equally
remarkable
and
that
no
one
has
ever
contended
that
he
was
a
physician
here
mr
collins
is
wrong
that
contention
also
has
been
put
forward
it
may
be
urged
that
his
acquaintance
with
the
technicalities
of
other
crafts
and
callings
notably
of
marine
and
military
affairs
was
also
extraordinary
and
yet
no
one
has
suspected
him
of
being
a
sailor
or
a
soldier
wrong
again
why
even
messrs
garnett
and
gosse
suspect
that
he
was
a
soldier
this
may
be
conceded
but
the
concession
hardly
furnishes
an
analogy
to
these
and
all
other
subjects
he
recurs
occasionally
and
in
season
but
with
reminiscences
of
the
law
his
memory
as
is
abundantly
clear
was
simply
saturated
in
season
and
out
of
season
now
in
manifest
now
in
recondite
application
he
presses
it
into
the
service
of
expression
and
illustration
at
least
a
third
of
his
myriad
metaphors
are
derived
from
it
it
would
indeed
be
difficult
to
find
a
single
act
in
any
of
his
dramas
nay
in
some
of
them
a
single
scene
the
diction
and
imagery
of
which
are
not
colored
by
it
much
of
his
law
may
have
been
acquired
from
three
books
easily
accessible
to
him
namely
tottell's
precedents
pulton's
statutes
and
fraunce's
lawier's
logike
works
with
which
he
certainly
seems
to
have
been
familiar
but
much
of
it
could
only
have
come
from
one
who
had
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
legal
proceedings
we
quite
agree
with
mr
castle
that
shakespeare's
legal
knowledge
is
not
what
could
have
been
picked
up
in
an
attorney's
office
but
could
only
have
been
learned
by
an
actual
attendance
at
the
courts
at
a
pleader's
chambers
and
on
circuit
or
by
associating
intimately
with
members
of
the
bench
and
bar
this
is
excellent
but
what
is
mr
collins's
explanation
perhaps
the
simplest
solution
of
the
problem
is
to
accept
the
hypothesis
that
in
early
life
he
was
in
an
attorney's
office
that
he
there
contracted
a
love
for
the
law
which
never
left
him
that
as
a
young
man
in
london
he
continued
to
study
or
dabble
in
it
for
his
amusement
to
stroll
in
leisure
hours
into
the
courts
and
to
frequent
the
society
of
lawyers
on
no
other
supposition
is
it
possible
to
explain
the
attraction
which
the
law
evidently
had
for
him
and
his
minute
and
undeviating
accuracy
in
a
subject
where
no
layman
who
has
indulged
in
such
copious
and
ostentatious
display
of
legal
technicalities
has
ever
yet
succeeded
in
keeping
himself
from
tripping
a
lame
conclusion
no
other
supposition
indeed
yes
there
is
another
and
a
very
obvious
supposition
namely
that
shakespeare
was
himself
a
lawyer
well
versed
in
his
trade
versed
in
all
the
ways
of
the
courts
and
living
in
close
intimacy
with
judges
and
members
of
the
inns
of
court
one
is
of
course
thankful
that
mr
collins
has
appreciated
the
fact
that
shakespeare
must
have
had
a
sound
legal
training
but
i
may
be
forgiven
if
i
do
not
attach
quite
so
much
importance
to
his
pronouncements
on
this
branch
of
the
subject
as
to
those
of
malone
lord
campbell
judge
holmes
mr
castle
k
c
lord
penzance
mr
grant
white
and
other
lawyers
who
have
expressed
their
opinion
on
the
matter
of
shakespeare's
legal
acquirements
here
it
may
perhaps
be
worth
while
to
quote
again
from
lord
penzance's
book
as
to
the
suggestion
that
shakespeare
had
somehow
or
other
managed
to
acquire
a
perfect
familiarity
with
legal
principles
and
an
accurate
and
ready
use
of
the
technical
terms
and
phrases
not
only
of
the
conveyancer's
office
but
of
the
pleader's
chambers
and
the
courts
at
westminster
this
as
lord
penzance
points
out
would
require
nothing
short
of
employment
in
some
career
involving
constant
contact
with
legal
questions
and
general
legal
work
but
in
what
portion
of
shakespeare's
career
would
it
be
possible
to
point
out
that
time
could
be
found
for
the
interposition
of
a
legal
employment
in
the
chambers
or
offices
of
practicing
lawyers
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
at
an
early
period
he
was
called
upon
to
abandon
his
attendance
at
school
and
assist
his
father
and
was
soon
after
at
the
age
of
sixteen
bound
apprentice
to
a
trade
while
under
the
obligation
of
this
bond
he
could
not
have
pursued
any
other
employment
then
he
leaves
stratford
and
comes
to
london
he
has
to
provide
himself
with
the
means
of
a
livelihood
and
this
he
did
in
some
capacity
at
the
theater
no
one
doubts
that
the
holding
of
horses
is
scouted
by
many
and
perhaps
with
justice
as
being
unlikely
and
certainly
unproved
but
whatever
the
nature
of
his
employment
was
at
the
theater
there
is
hardly
room
for
the
belief
that
it
could
have
been
other
than
continuous
for
his
progress
there
was
so
rapid
ere
long
he
had
been
taken
into
the
company
as
an
actor
and
was
soon
spoken
of
as
a
johannes
factotum
his
rapid
accumulation
of
wealth
speaks
volumes
for
the
constancy
and
activity
of
his
services
one
fails
to
see
when
there
could
be
a
break
in
the
current
of
his
life
at
this
period
of
it
giving
room
or
opportunity
for
legal
or
indeed
any
other
employment
in
says
knight
we
have
undeniable
evidence
that
he
had
not
only
a
casual
engagement
was
not
only
a
salaried
servant
as
many
players
were
but
was
a
shareholder
in
the
company
of
the
queen's
players
with
other
shareholders
below
him
on
the
list
this
would
be
within
two
years
after
his
arrival
in
london
which
is
placed
by
white
and
halliwell
phillipps
about
the
year
the
difficulty
in
supposing
that
starting
with
a
state
of
ignorance
in
when
he
is
supposed
to
have
come
to
london
he
was
induced
to
enter
upon
a
course
of
most
extended
study
and
mental
culture
is
almost
insuperable
still
it
was
physically
possible
provided
always
that
he
could
have
had
access
to
the
needful
books
but
this
legal
training
seems
to
me
to
stand
on
a
different
footing
it
is
not
only
unaccountable
and
incredible
but
it
is
actually
negatived
by
the
known
facts
of
his
career
lord
penzance
then
refers
to
the
fact
that
by
according
to
the
best
authority
mr
grant
white
several
of
the
plays
had
been
written
the
comedy
of
errors
in
love's
labour's
lost
in
two
gentlemen
of
verona
in
or
and
so
forth
and
then
asks
with
this
catalogue
of
dramatic
work
on
hand
was
it
possible
that
he
could
have
taken
a
leading
part
in
the
management
and
conduct
of
two
theaters
and
if
mr
phillipps
is
to
be
relied
upon
taken
his
share
in
the
performances
of
the
provincial
tours
of
his
company
and
at
the
same
time
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
the
law
in
all
its
branches
so
efficiently
as
to
make
himself
complete
master
of
its
principles
and
practice
and
saturate
his
mind
with
all
its
most
technical
terms
i
have
cited
this
passage
from
lord
penzance's
book
because
it
lay
before
me
and
i
had
already
quoted
from
it
on
the
matter
of
shakespeare's
legal
knowledge
but
other
writers
have
still
better
set
forth
the
insuperable
difficulties
as
they
seem
to
me
which
beset
the
idea
that
shakespeare
might
have
found
time
in
some
unknown
period
of
early
life
amid
multifarious
other
occupations
for
the
study
of
classics
literature
and
law
to
say
nothing
of
languages
and
a
few
other
matters
lord
penzance
further
asks
his
readers
did
you
ever
meet
with
or
hear
of
an
instance
in
which
a
young
man
in
this
country
gave
himself
up
to
legal
studies
and
engaged
in
legal
employments
which
is
the
only
way
of
becoming
familiar
with
the
technicalities
of
practice
unless
with
the
view
of
practicing
in
that
profession
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
be
easy
or
indeed
possible
to
produce
an
instance
in
which
the
law
has
been
seriously
studied
in
all
its
branches
except
as
a
qualification
for
practice
in
the
legal
profession
this
testimony
is
so
strong
so
direct
so
authoritative
and
so
uncheapened
unwatered
by
guesses
and
surmises
and
maybe
so's
and
might
have
beens
and
could
have
beens
and
must
have
beens
and
the
rest
of
that
ton
of
plaster
of
paris
out
of
which
the
biographers
have
built
the
colossal
brontosaur
which
goes
by
the
stratford
actor's
name
that
it
quite
convinces
me
that
the
man
who
wrote
shakespeare's
works
knew
all
about
law
and
lawyers
also
that
that
man
could
not
have
been
the
stratford
shakespeare
and
wasn't
who
did
write
these
works
then
i
wish
i
knew
from
chapter
xiii
of
the
shakespeare
problem
restated
by
george
g
greenwood
m
p
john
lane
company
publishers
ix
did
francis
bacon
write
shakespeare's
works
nobody
knows
we
cannot
say
we
know
a
thing
when
that
thing
has
not
been
proved
know
is
too
strong
a
word
to
use
when
the
evidence
is
not
final
and
absolutely
conclusive
we
can
infer
if
we
want
to
like
those
slaves
no
i
will
not
write
that
word
it
is
not
kind
it
is
not
courteous
the
upholders
of
the
stratford
shakespeare
superstition
call
us
the
hardest
names
they
can
think
of
and
they
keep
doing
it
all
the
time
very
well
if
they
like
to
descend
to
that
level
let
them
do
it
but
i
will
not
so
undignify
myself
as
to
follow
them
i
cannot
call
them
harsh
names
the
most
i
can
do
is
to
indicate
them
by
terms
reflecting
my
disapproval
and
this
without
malice
without
venom
to
resume
what
i
was
about
to
say
was
those
thugs
have
built
their
entire
superstition
upon
inferences
not
upon
known
and
established
facts
it
is
a
weak
method
and
poor
and
i
am
glad
to
be
able
to
say
our
side
never
resorts
to
it
while
there
is
anything
else
to
resort
to
but
when
we
must
we
must
and
we
have
now
arrived
at
a
place
of
that
sort
since
the
stratford
shakespeare
couldn't
have
written
the
works
we
infer
that
somebody
did
who
was
it
then
this
requires
some
more
inferring
ordinarily
when
an
unsigned
poem
sweeps
across
the
continent
like
a
tidal
wave
whose
roar
and
boom
and
thunder
are
made
up
of
admiration
delight
and
applause
a
dozen
obscure
people
rise
up
and
claim
the
authorship
why
a
dozen
instead
of
only
one
or
two
one
reason
is
because
there
are
a
dozen
that
are
recognizably
competent
to
do
that
poem
do
you
remember
beautiful
snow
do
you
remember
rock
me

mother
rock
me
to
sleep
do
you
remember
backward
turn
backward
o
time
in
thy
flight
make
me
a
child
again
just
for
tonight
i
remember
them
very
well
their
authorship
was
claimed
by
most
of
the
grown
up
people
who
were
alive
at
the
time
and
every
claimant
had
one
plausible
argument
in
his
favor
at
least
to
wit
he
could
have
done
the
authoring
he
was
competent
have
the
works
been
claimed
by
a
dozen
they
haven't
there
was
good
reason
the
world
knows
there
was
but
one
man
on
the
planet
at
the
time
who
was
competent
not
a
dozen
and
not
two
a
long
time
ago
the
dwellers
in
a
far
country
used
now
and
then
to
find
a
procession
of
prodigious
footprints
stretching
across
the
plain
footprints
that
were
three
miles
apart
each
footprint
a
third
of
a
mile
long
and
a
furlong
deep
and
with
forests
and
villages
mashed
to
mush
in
it
was
there
any
doubt
as
to
who
made
that
mighty
trail
were
there
a
dozen
claimants
where
there
two
no
the
people
knew
who
it
was
that
had
been
along
there
there
was
only
one
hercules
there
has
been
only
one
shakespeare
there
couldn't
be
two
certainly
there
couldn't
be
two
at
the
same
time
it
takes
ages
to
bring
forth
a
shakespeare
and
some
more
ages
to
match
him
this
one
was
not
matched
before
his
time
nor
during
his
time
and
hasn't
been
matched
since
the
prospect
of
matching
him
in
our
time
is
not
bright
the
baconians
claim
that
the
stratford
shakespeare
was
not
qualified
to
write
the
works
and
that
francis
bacon
was
they
claim
that
bacon
possessed
the
stupendous
equipment
both
natural
and
acquired
for
the
miracle
and
that
no
other
englishman
of
his
day
possessed
the
like
or
indeed
anything
closely
approaching
it
macaulay
in
his
essay
has
much
to
say
about
the
splendor
and
horizonless
magnitude
of
that
equipment
also
he
has
synopsized
bacon's
history
a
thing
which
cannot
be
done
for
the
stratford
shakespeare
for
he
hasn't
any
history
to
synopsize
bacon's
history
is
open
to
the
world
from
his
boyhood
to
his
death
in
old
age
a
history
consisting
of
known
facts
displayed
in
minute
and
multitudinous
detail
facts
not
guesses
and
conjectures
and
might
have
beens
whereby
it
appears
that
he
was
born
of
a
race
of
statesmen
and
had
a
lord
chancellor
for
his
father
and
a
mother
who
was
distinguished
both
as
a
linguist
and
a
theologian
she
corresponded
in
greek
with
bishop
jewell
and
translated
his
apologia
from
the
latin
so
correctly
that
neither
he
nor
archbishop
parker
could
suggest
a
single
alteration
it
is
the
atmosphere
we
are
reared
in
that
determines
how
our
inclinations
and
aspirations
shall
tend
the
atmosphere
furnished
by
the
parents
to
the
son
in
this
present
case
was
an
atmosphere
saturated
with
learning
with
thinkings
and
ponderings
upon
deep
subjects
and
with
polite
culture
it
had
its
natural
effect
shakespeare
of
stratford
was
reared
in
a
house
which
had
no
use
for
books
since
its
owners
his
parents
were
without
education
this
may
have
had
an
effect
upon
the
son
but
we
do
not
know
because
we
have
no
history
of
him
of
an
informing
sort
there
were
but
few
books
anywhere
in
that
day
and
only
the
well
to
do
and
highly
educated
possessed
them
they
being
almost
confined
to
the
dead
languages
all
the
valuable
books
then
extant
in
all
the
vernacular
dialects
of
europe
would
hardly
have
filled
a
single
shelf
imagine
it
the
few
existing
books
were
in
the
latin
tongue
mainly
a
person
who
was
ignorant
of
it
was
shut
out
from
all
acquaintance
not
merely
with
cicero
and
virgil
but
with
the
most
interesting
memoirs
state
papers
and
pamphlets
of
his
own
time
a
literature
necessary
to
the
stratford
lad
for
his
fictitious
reputation's
sake
since
the
writer
of
his
works
would
begin
to
use
it
wholesale
and
in
a
most
masterly
way
before
the
lad
was
hardly
more
than
out
of
his
teens
and
into
his
twenties
at
fifteen
bacon
was
sent
to
the
university
and
he
spent
three
years
there
thence
he
went
to
paris
in
the
train
of
the
english
ambassador
and
there
he
mingled
daily
with
the
wise
the
cultured
the
great
and
the
aristocracy
of
fashion
during
another
three
years
a
total
of
six
years
spent
at
the
sources
of
knowledge
knowledge
both
of
books
and
of
men
the
three
spent
at
the
university
were
coeval
with
the
second
and
last
three
spent
by
the
little
stratford
lad
at
stratford
school
supposedly
and
perhapsedly
and
maybe
and
by
inference
with
nothing
to
infer
from
the
second
three
of
the
baconian
six
were
presumably
spent
by
the
stratford
lad
as
apprentice
to
a
butcher
that
is
the
thugs
presume
it
on
no
evidence
of
any
kind
which
is
their
way
when
they
want
a
historical
fact
fact
and
presumption
are
for
business
purposes
all
the
same
to
them
they
know
the
difference
but
they
also
know
how
to
blink
it
they
know
too
that
while
in
history
building
a
fact
is
better
than
a
presumption
it
doesn't
take
a
presumption
long
to
bloom
into
a
fact
when
they
have
the
handling
of
it
they
know
by
old
experience
that
when
they
get
hold
of
a
presumption
tadpole
he
is
not
going
to
stay
tadpole
in
their
history
tank
no
they
know
how
to
develop
him
into
the
giant
four
legged
bullfrog
of
fact
and
make
him
sit
up
on
his
hams
and
puff
out
his
chin
and
look
important
and
insolent
and
come
to
stay
and
assert
his
genuine
simon
pure
authenticity
with
a
thundering
bellow
that
will
convince
everybody
because
it
is
so
loud
the
thug
is
aware
that
loudness
convinces
sixty
persons
where
reasoning
convinces
but
one
i
wouldn't
be
a
thug
not
even
if
but
never
mind
about
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
argument
and
it
is
not
noble
in
spirit
besides
if
i
am
better
than
a
thug
is
the
merit
mine
no
it
is
his
then
to
him
be
the
praise
that
is
the
right
spirit
they
presume
the
lad
severed
his
presumed
connection
with
the
stratford
school
to
become
apprentice
to
a
butcher
they
also
presume
that
the
butcher
was
his
father
they
don't
know
there
is
no
written
record
of
it
nor
any
other
actual
evidence
if
it
would
have
helped
their
case
any
they
would
have
apprenticed
him
to
thirty
butchers
to
fifty
butchers
to
a
wilderness
of
butchers
all
by
their
patented
method
presumption
if
it
will
help
their
case
they
will
do
it
yet
and
if
it
will
further
help
it
they
will
presume
that
all
those
butchers
were
his
father
and
the
week
after
they
will
say
it
why
it
is
just
like
being
the
past
tense
of
the
compound
reflexive
adverbial
incandescent
hypodermic
irregular
accusative
noun
of
multitude
which
is
father
to
the
expression
which
the
grammarians
call
verb
it
is
like
a
whole
ancestry
with
only
one
posterity
to
resume
next
the
young
bacon
took
up
the
study
of
law
and
mastered
that
abstruse
science
from
that
day
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
was
daily
in
close
contact
with
lawyers
and
judges
not
as
a
casual
onlooker
in
intervals
between
holding
horses
in
front
of
a
theater
but
as
a
practicing
lawyer
a
great
and
successful
one
a
renowned
one
a
launcelot
of
the
bar
the
most
formidable
lance
in
the
high
brotherhood
of
the
legal
table
round
he
lived
in
the
law's
atmosphere
thenceforth
all
his
years
and
by
sheer
ability
forced
his
way
up
its
difficult
steeps
to
its
supremest
summit
the
lord
chancellorship
leaving
behind
him
no
fellow
craftsman
qualified
to
challenge
his
divine
right
to
that
majestic
place
when
we
read
the
praises
bestowed
by
lord
penzance
and
the
other
illustrious
experts
upon
the
legal
condition
and
legal
aptnesses
brilliances
profundities
and
felicities
so
prodigally
displayed
in
the
plays
and
try
to
fit
them
to
the
historyless
stratford
stage
manager
they
sound
wild
strange
incredible
ludicrous
but
when
we
put
them
in
the
mouth
of
bacon
they
do
not
sound
strange
they
seem
in
their
natural
and
rightful
place
they
seem
at
home
there
please
turn
back
and
read
them
again
attributed
to
shakespeare
of
stratford
they
are
meaningless
they
are
inebriate
extravagancies
intemperate
admirations
of
the
dark
side
of
the
moon
so
to
speak
attributed
to
bacon
they
are
admirations
of
the
golden
glories
of
the
moon's
front
side
the
moon
at
the
full
and
not
intemperate
not
overwrought
but
sane
and
right
and
justified
at
every
turn
and
point
at
which
the
author
required
a
metaphor
simile
or
illustration
his
mind
ever
turned
first
to
the
law
he
seems
almost
to
have
thought
in
legal
phrases
the
commonest
legal
phrases
the
commonest
of
legal
expressions
were
ever
at
the
end
of
his
pen
that
could
happen
to
no
one
but
a
person
whose
trade
was
the
law
it
could
not
happen
to
a
dabbler

fill
their

with
sailor
phrases
and
draw
all
their

but
no
mere
passenger
ever
does
it
be
he

or
elsewhere
or
could
do
it
with
anything
resembling
accuracy
if
he
were
hardy
enough
to
try
please
read
again
what
lord
campbell
and
the
other
great
authorities
have
said
about
bacon
when
they
thought
they
were
saying
it
about
shakespeare
of
stratford
x
the
rest
of
the
equipment
the
author
of
the
plays
was
equipped
beyond
every
other
man
of
his
time
with
wisdom
erudition
imagination
capaciousness
of
mind
grace
and
majesty
of
expression
every
one
has
said
it
no
one
doubts
it
also
he
had
humor
humor
in
rich
abundance
and
always
wanting
to
break
out
we
have
no
evidence
of
any
kind
that
shakespeare
of
stratford
possessed
any
of
these
gifts
or
any
of
these
acquirements
the
only
lines
he
ever
wrote
so
far
as
we
know
are
substantially
barren
of
them
barren
of
all
of
them

ben
jonson
says
of
bacon
as
orator
his
language
where
he
could
spare
and
pass
by
a
jest
was
nobly
censorious
no
man
ever
spoke
more
neatly
more
pressly
more
weightily
or
suffered
less
emptiness
less
idleness
in
what
he
uttered
no
member
of
his
speech
but
consisted
of
his
its
own
graces
the
fear
of
every
man
that
heard
him
was
lest
he
should
make
an
end
from
macaulay
he
continued
to
distinguish
himself
in
parliament
particularly
by
his
exertions
in
favor
of
one
excellent
measure
on
which
the
king's
heart
was
set
the
union
of
england
and
scotland
it
was
not
difficult
for
such
an
intellect
to
discover
many
irresistible
arguments
in
favor
of
such
a
scheme
he
conducted
the
great
case
of
the
post
nati
in
the
exchequer
chamber
and
the
decision
of
the
judges
a
decision
the
legality
of
which
may
be
questioned
but
the
beneficial
effect
of
which
must
be
acknowledged
was
in
a
great
measure
attributed
to
his
dexterous
management
again
while
actively
engaged
in
the
house
of
commons
and
in
the
courts
of
law
he
still
found
leisure
for
letters
and
philosophy
the
noble
treatise
on
the
advancement
of
learning
which
at
a
later
period
was
expanded
into
the
de
augmentis
appeared
in
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
a
work
which
if
it
had
proceeded
from
any
other
writer
would
have
been
considered
as
a
masterpiece
of
wit
and
learning
was
printed
in
in
the
mean
time
the
novum
organum
was
slowly
proceeding
several
distinguished
men
of
learning
had
been
permitted
to
see
portions
of
that
extraordinary
book
and
they
spoke
with
the
greatest
admiration
of
his
genius
even
sir
thomas
bodley
after
perusing
the
cogitata
et
visa
one
of
the
most
precious
of
those
scattered
leaves
out
of
which
the
great
oracular
volume
was
afterward
made
up
acknowledged
that
in
all
proposals
and
plots
in
that
book
bacon
showed
himself
a
master
workman
and
that
it
could
not
be
gainsaid
but
all
the
treatise
over
did
abound
with
choice
conceits
of
the
present
state
of
learning
and
with
worthy
contemplations
of
the
means
to
procure
it
in
a
new
edition
of
the
essays
appeared
with
additions
surpassing
the
original
collection
both
in
bulk
and
quality
nor
did
these
pursuits
distract
bacon's
attention
from
a
work
the
most
arduous
the
most
glorious
and
the
most
useful
that
even
his
mighty
powers
could
have
achieved
the
reducing
and
recompiling
to
use
his
own
phrase
of
the
laws
of
england
to
serve
the
exacting
and
laborious
offices
of
attorney
general
and
solicitor
general
would
have
satisfied
the
appetite
of
any
other
man
for
hard
work
but
bacon
had
to
add
the
vast
literary
industries
just
described
to
satisfy
his
he
was
a
born
worker
the
service
which
he
rendered
to
letters
during
the
last
five
years
of
his
life
amid
ten
thousand
distractions
and
vexations
increase
the
regret
with
which
we
think
on
the
many
years
which
he
had
wasted
to
use
the
words
of
sir
thomas
bodley
on
such
study
as
was
not
worthy
such
a
student
he
commenced
a
digest
of
the
laws
of
england
a
history
of
england
under
the
princes
of
the
house
of
tudor
a
body
of
national
history
a
philosophical
romance
he
made
extensive
and
valuable
additions
to
his
essays
he
published
the
inestimable
treatise
de
augmentis
scientiarum
did
these
labors
of
hercules
fill
up
his
time
to
his
contentment
and
quiet
his
appetite
for
work
not
entirely
the
trifles
with
which
he
amused
himself
in
hours
of
pain
and
languor
bore
the
mark
of
his
mind
the
best
jest
book
in
the
world
is
that
which
he
dictated
from
memory
without
referring
to
any
book
on
a
day
on
which
illness
had
rendered
him
incapable
of
serious
study
here
are
some
scattered
remarks
from
macaulay
which
throw
light
upon
bacon
and
seem
to
indicate
and
maybe
demonstrate
that
he
was
competent
to
write
the
plays
and
poems
with
great
minuteness
of
observation
he
had
an
amplitude
of
comprehension
such
as
has
never
yet
been
vouchsafed
to
any
other
human
being
the
essays
contain
abundant
proofs
that
no
nice
feature
of
character
no
peculiarity
in
the
ordering
of
a
house
a
garden
or
a
court
masque
could
escape
the
notice
of
one
whose
mind
was
capable
of
taking
in
the
whole
world
of
knowledge
his
understanding
resembled
the
tent
which
the
fairy
paribanou
gave
to
prince
ahmed
fold
it
and
it
seemed
a
toy
for
the
hand
of
a
lady
spread
it
and
the
armies
of
the
powerful
sultans
might
repose
beneath
its
shade
the
knowledge
in
which
bacon
excelled
all
men
was
a
knowledge
of
the
mutual
relations
of
all
departments
of
knowledge
in
a
letter
written
when
he
was
only
thirty
one
to
his
uncle
lord
burleigh
he
said
i
have
taken
all
knowledge
to
be
my
province
though
bacon
did
not
arm
his
philosophy
with
the
weapons
of
logic
he
adorned
her
profusely
with
all
the
richest
decorations
of
rhetoric
the
practical
faculty
was
powerful
in
bacon
but
not
like
his
wit
so
powerful
as
occasionally
to
usurp
the
place
of
his
reason
and
to
tyrannize
over
the
whole
man
there
are
too
many
places
in
the
plays
where
this
happens
poor
old
dying
john
of
gaunt
volleying
second
rate
puns
at
his
own
name
is
a
pathetic
instance
of
it
we
may
assume
that
it
is
bacon's
fault
but
the
stratford
shakespeare
has
to
bear
the
blame
no
imagination
was
ever
at
once
so
strong
and
so
thoroughly
subjugated
it
stopped
at
the
first
check
from
good
sense
in
truth
much
of
bacon's
life
was
passed
in
a
visionary
world
amid
things
as
strange
as
any
that
are
described
in
the
arabian
tales
amid
buildings
more
sumptuous
than
the
palace
of
aladdin
fountains
more
wonderful
than
the
golden
water
of
parizade
conveyances
more
rapid
than
the
hippogryph
of
ruggiero
arms
more
formidable
than
the
lance
of
astolfo
remedies
more
efficacious
than
the
balsam
of
fierabras
yet
in
his
magnificent
day
dreams
there
was
nothing
wild
nothing
but
what
sober
reason
sanctioned
bacon's
greatest
performance
is
the
first
book
of
the
novum
organum
every
part
of
it
blazes
with
wit
but
with
wit
which
is
employed
only
to
illustrate
and
decorate
truth
no
book
ever
made
so
great
a
revolution
in
the
mode
of
thinking
overthrew
so
may
prejudices
introduced
so
many
new
opinions
but
what
we
most
admire
is
the
vast
capacity
of
that
intellect
which
without
effort
takes
in
at
once
all
the
domains
of
science
all
the
past
the
present
and
the
future
all
the
errors
of
two
thousand
years
all
the
encouraging
signs
of
the
passing
times
all
the
bright
hopes
of
the
coming
age
he
had
a
wonderful
talent
for
packing
thought
close
and
rendering
it
portable
his
eloquence
would
alone
have
entitled
him
to
a
high
rank
in
literature
it
is
evident
that
he
had
each
and
every
one
of
the
mental
gifts
and
each
and
every
one
of
the
acquirements
that
are
so
prodigally
displayed
in
the
plays
and
poems
and
in
much
higher
and
richer
degree
than
any
other
man
of
his
time
or
of
any
previous
time
he
was
a
genius
without
a
mate
a
prodigy
not
matable
there
was
only
one
of
him
the
planet
could
not
produce
two
of
him
at
one
birth
nor
in
one
age
he
could
have
written
anything
that
is
in
the
plays
and
poems
he
could
have
written
this
the
cloud
cap'd
towers
the
gorgeous
palaces
the
solemn
temples
the
great
globe
itself
yea
all
which
it
inherit
shall
dissolve
and
like
an
insubstantial
pageant
faded
leave
not
a
rack
behind
we
are
such
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
on
and
our
little
life
is
rounded
with
a
sleep
also
he
could
have
written
this
but
he
refrained
good
friend
for
iesus
sake
forbeare
to
digg
the
dust
encloased
heare
blest
be
ye
man
yt
spares

and
curst
be
he
yt
moves
my
bones
when
a
person
reads
the
noble
verses
about
the
cloud
cap'd
towers
he
ought
not
to
follow
it
immediately
with
good
friend
for
iesus
sake
forbeare
because
he
will
find
the
transition
from
great
poetry
to
poor
prose
too
violent
for
comfort
it
will
give
him
a
shock
you
never
notice
how
commonplace
and
unpoetic
gravel
is
until
you
bite
into
a
layer
of
it
in
a
pie
xi
am
i
trying
to
convince
anybody
that
shakespeare
did
not
write
shakespeare's
works
ah
now
what
do
you
take
me
for
would
i
be
so
soft
as
that
after
having
known
the
human
race
familiarly
for
nearly
seventy
four
years
it
would
grieve
me
to
know
that
any
one
could
think
so
injuriously
of
me
so
uncomplimentarily
so
unadmiringly
of
me
no
no
i
am
aware
that
when
even
the
brightest
mind
in
our
world
has
been
trained
up
from
childhood
in
a
superstition
of
any
kind
it
will
never
be
possible
for
that
mind
in
its
maturity
to
examine
sincerely
dispassionately
and
conscientiously
any
evidence
or
any
circumstance
which
shall
seem
to
cast
a
doubt
upon
the
validity
of
that
superstition
i
doubt
if
i
could
do
it
myself
we
always
get
at
second
hand
our
notions
about
systems
of
government
and
high
tariff
and
low
tariff
and
prohibition
and
anti
prohibition
and
the
holiness
of
peace
and
the
glories
of
war
and
codes
of
honor
and
codes
of
morals
and
approval
of
the
duel
and
disapproval
of
it
and
our
beliefs
concerning
the
nature
of
cats
and
our
ideas
as
to
whether
the
murder
of
helpless
wild
animals
is
base
or
is
heroic
and
our
preferences
in
the
matter
of
religious
and
political
parties
and
our
acceptance
or
rejection
of
the
shakespeares
and
the
author
ortons
and
the
mrs
eddys
we
get
them
all
at
second
hand
we
reason
none
of
them
out
for
ourselves
it
is
the
way
we
are
made
it
is
the
way
we
are
all
made
and
we
can't
help
it
we
can't
change
it
and
whenever
we
have
been
furnished
a
fetish
and
have
been
taught
to
believe
in
it
and
love
it
and
worship
it
and
refrain
from
examining
it
there
is
no
evidence
howsoever
clear
and
strong
that
can
persuade
us
to
withdraw
from
it
our
loyalty
and
our
devotion
in
morals
conduct
and
beliefs
we
take
the
color
of
our
environment
and
associations
and
it
is
a
color
that
can
safely
be
warranted
to
wash
whenever
we
have
been
furnished
with
a
tar
baby
ostensibly
stuffed
with
jewels
and
warned
that
it
will
be
dishonorable
and
irreverent
to
disembowel
it
and
test
the
jewels
we
keep
our
sacrilegious
hands
off
it
we
submit
not
reluctantly
but
rather
gladly
for
we
are
privately
afraid
we
should
find
upon
examination
that
the
jewels
are
of
the
sort
that
are
manufactured
at
north
adams
mass
i
haven't
any
idea
that
shakespeare
will
have
to
vacate
his
pedestal
this
side
of
the
year
disbelief
in
him
cannot
come
swiftly
disbelief
in
a
healthy
and
deeply
loved
tar
baby
has
never
been
known
to
disintegrate
swiftly
it
is
a
very
slow
process
it
took
several
thousand
years
to
convince
our
fine
race
including
every
splendid
intellect
in
it
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
witch
it
has
taken
several
thousand
years
to
convince
the
same
fine
race
including
every
splendid
intellect
in
it
that
there
is
no
such
person
as
satan
it
has
taken
several
centuries
to
remove
perdition
from
the
protestant
church's
program
of
post
mortem
entertainments
it
has
taken
a
weary
long
time
to
persuade
american
presbyterians
to
give
up
infant
damnation
and
try
to
bear
it
the
best
they
can
and
it
looks
as
if
their
scotch
brethren
will
still
be
burning
babies
in
the
everlasting
fires
when
shakespeare
comes
down
from
his
perch
we
are
the
reasoning
race
we
can't
prove
it
by
the
above
examples
and
we
can't
prove
it
by
the
miraculous
histories
built
by
those
stratfordolaters
out
of
a
hatful
of
rags
and
a
barrel
of
sawdust
but
there
is
a
plenty
of
other
things
we
can
prove
it
by
if
i
could
think
of
them
we
are
the
reasoning
race
and
when
we
find
a
vague
file
of
chipmunk
tracks
stringing
through
the
dust
of
stratford
village
we
know
by
our
reasoning
bowers
that
hercules
has
been
along
there
i
feel
that
our
fetish
is
safe
for
three
centuries
yet
the
bust
too
there
in
the
stratford
church
the
precious
bust
the
priceless
bust
the
calm
bust
the
serene
bust
the
emotionless
bust
with
the
dandy
mustache
and
the
putty
face
unseamed
of
care
that
face
which
has
looked
passionlessly
down
upon
the
awed
pilgrim
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
and
will
still
look
down
upon
the
awed
pilgrim
three
hundred
more
with
the
deep
deep
deep
subtle
subtle
subtle
expression
of
a
bladder
xii
irreverence
one
of
the
most
trying
defects
which
i
find
in
these
these
what
shall
i
call
them
for
i
will
not
apply
injurious
epithets
to
them
the
way
they
do
to
us
such
violations
of
courtesy
being
repugnant
to
my
nature
and
my
dignity
the
farthest
i
can
go
in
that
direction
is
to
call
them
by
names
of
limited
reverence
names
merely
descriptive
never
unkind
never
offensive
never
tainted
by
harsh
feeling
if
they
would
do
like
this
they
would
feel
better
in
their
hearts
very
well
then
to
proceed
one
of
the
most
trying
defects
which
i
find
in
these
stratfordolaters
these
shakesperiods
these
thugs
these
bangalores
these
troglodytes
these
herumfrodites
these
blatherskites
these
buccaneers
these
bandoleers
is
their
spirit
of
irreverence
it
is
detectable
in
every
utterance
of
theirs
when
they
are
talking
about
us
i
am
thankful
that
in
me
there
is
nothing
of
that
spirit
when
a
thing
is
sacred
to
me
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
be
irreverent
toward
it
i
cannot
call
to
mind
a
single
instance
where
i
have
ever
been
irreverent
except
towards
the
things
which
were
sacred
to
other
people
am
i
in
the
right
i
think
so
but
i
ask
no
one
to
take
my
unsupported
word
no
look
at
the
dictionary
let
the
dictionary
decide
here
is
the
definition
irreverence
the
quality
or
condition
of
irreverence
toward
god
and
sacred
things
what
does
the
hindu
say
he
says
it
is
correct
he
says
irreverence
is
lack
of
respect
for
vishnu
and
brahma
and
chrishna
and
his
other
gods
and
for
his
sacred
cattle
and
for
his
temples
and
the
things
within
them
he
endorses
the
definition
you
see
and
there
are
hindus
or
their
equivalents
back
of
him
the
dictionary
had
the
acute
idea
that
by
using
the
capital
g
it
could
restrict
irreverence
to
lack
of
reverence
for
our
deity
and
our
sacred
things
but
that
ingenious
and
rather
sly
idea
miscarried
for
by
the
simple
process
of
spelling
his
deities
with
capitals
the
hindu
confiscates
the
definition
and
restricts
it
to
his
own
sects
thus
making
it
clearly
compulsory
upon
us
to
revere
his
gods
and
his
sacred
things
and
nobody's
else
we
can't
say
a
word
for
he
has
our
own
dictionary
at
his
back
and
its
decision
is
final
this
law
reduced
to
its
simplest
terms
is
this
whatever
is
sacred
to
the
christian
must
be
held
in
reverence
by
everybody
else
whatever
is
sacred
to
the
hindu
must
be
held
in
reverence
by
everybody
else
therefore
by
consequence
logically
and
indisputably
whatever
is
sacred
to
me
must
be
held
in
reverence
by
everybody
else
now
then
what
aggravates
me
is
that
these
troglodytes
and
muscovites
and
bandoleers
and
buccaneers
are
also
trying
to
crowd
in
and
share
the
benefit
of
the
law
and
compel
everybody
to
revere
their
shakespeare
and
hold
him
sacred
we
can't
have
that
there's
enough
of
us
already
if
you
go
on
widening
and
spreading
and
inflating
the
privilege
it
will
presently
come
to
be
conceded
that
each
man's
sacred
things
are
the
only
ones
and
the
rest
of
the
human
race
will
have
to
be
humbly
reverent
toward
them
or
suffer
for
it
that
can
surely
happen
and
when
it
happens
the
word
irreverence
will
be
regarded
as
the
most
meaningless
and
foolish
and
self
conceited
and
insolent
and
impudent
and
dictatorial
word
in
the
language
and
people
will
say
whose
business
is
it
what
gods
i
worship
and
what
things
hold
sacred
who
has
the
right
to
dictate
to
my
conscience
and
where
did
he
get
that
right
we
cannot
afford
to
let
that
calamity
come
upon
us
we
must
save
the
word
from
this
destruction
there
is
but
one
way
to
do
it
and
that
is
to
stop
the
spread
of
the
privilege
and
strictly
confine
it
to
its
present
limits
that
is
to
all
the
christian
sects
to
all
the
hindu
sects
and
me
we
do
not
need
any
more
the
stock
is
watered
enough
just
as
it
is
it
would
be
better
if
the
privilege
were
limited
to
me
alone
i
think
so
because
i
am
the
only
sect
that
knows
how
to
employ
it
gently
kindly
charitably
dispassionately
the
other
sects
lack
the
quality
of
self
restraint
the
catholic
church
says
the
most
irreverent
things
about
matters
which
are
sacred
to
the
protestants
and
the
protestant
church
retorts
in
kind
about
the
confessional
and
other
matters
which
catholics
hold
sacred
then
both
of
these
irreverencers
turn
upon
thomas
paine
and
charge
him
with
irreverence
this
is
all
unfortunate
because
it
makes
it
difficult
for
students
equipped
with
only
a
low
grade
of
mentality
to
find
out
what
irreverence
really
is
it
will
surely
be
much
better
all
around
if
the
privilege
of
regulating
the
irreverent
and
keeping
them
in
order
shall
eventually
be
withdrawn
from
all
the
sects
but
me
then
there
will
be
no
more
quarreling
no
more
bandying
of
disrespectful
epithets
no
more
heartburnings
there
will
then
be
nothing
sacred
involved
in
this
bacon
shakespeare
controversy
except
what
is
sacred
to
me
that
will
simplify
the
whole
matter
and
trouble
will
cease
there
will
be
irreverence
no
longer
because
i
will
not
allow
it
the
first
time
those
criminals
charge
me
with
irreverence
for
calling
their
stratford
myth
an
arthur
orton
mary
baker
thompson
eddy
louis
the
seventeenth
veiled
prophet
of
khorassan
will
be
the
last
taught
by
the
methods
found
effective
in
extinguishing
earlier
offenders
by
the
inquisition
of
holy
memory
i
shall
know
how
to
quiet
them

isn't
it
odd
when
you
think
of
it
that
you
may
list
all
the
celebrated

and
scotchmen
of
modern
times
clear
back
to
the

a

we
say
and
you
can
go

learn

of
the

of
every

every

except
one
the

the

renowned
by
far
the
most
illustrious

you
can

you

just

the
most
extraordinary
and
the
most
celebrated
of

you
may
add
to
the
list
the
thousand
celebrated
persons
furnished
by
the
rest
of

in
the
past
four
centuries
and
you
can
find
out
the
life
histories
of
all
those
people
too
you
will
then
have
listed
fifteen
hundred
celebrities
and
you
can
trace
the
authentic
life
histories
of
the
whole
of
them
save
one
far
and
away
the
most
colossal
prodigy
of
the
entire
accumulation
shakespeare
about
him
you
can
find
out
nothing
nothing
of
even
the
slightest
importance
nothing
worth
the
trouble
of
stowing
away
in
your
memory
nothing
that
even
remotely
indicates
that
he
was
ever
anything
more
than
a
distinctly
commonplace
person
a
manager
an
actor
of
inferior
grade
a
small
trader
in
a
small
village
that
did
not
regard
him
as
a
person
of
any
consequence
and
had
forgotten
all
about
him
before
he
was
fairly
cold
in
his
grave
we
can
go
to
the
records
and
find
out
the
life
history
of
every
renowned
race
horse
of
modern
times
but
not
shakespeare's
there
are
many
reasons
why
and
they
have
been
furnished
in
cart
loads
of
guess
and
conjecture
by
those
troglodytes
but
there
is
one
that
is
worth
all
the
rest
of
the
reasons
put
together
and
is
abundantly
sufficient
all
by
itself
he
hadn't
any
history
to
record
there
is
no
way
of
getting
around
that
deadly
fact
and
no
sane
way
has
yet
been
discovered
of
getting
around
its
formidable
significance
its
quite
plain
significance
to
any
but
those
thugs
i
do
not
use
the
term
unkindly
is
that
shakespeare
had
no
prominence
while
he
lived
and
none
until
he
had
been
dead
two
or
three
generations
the
plays
enjoyed
high
fame
from
the
beginning
and
if
he
wrote
them
it
seems
a
pity
the
world
did
not
find
it
out
he
ought
to
have
explained
that
he
was
the
author
and
not
merely
a
nom
de
plume
for
another
man
to
hide
behind
if
he
had
been
less
intemperately
solicitous
about
his
bones
and
more
solicitous
about
his
works
it
would
have
been
better
for
his
good
name
and
a
kindness
to
us
the
bones
were
not
important
they
will
moulder
away
they
will
turn
to
dust
but
the
works
will
endure
until
the
last
sun
goes
down
mark
twain
p
s
march
about
two
months
ago
i
was
illuminating
this
autobiography
with
some
notions
of
mine
concerning
the
bacon
shakespeare
controversy
and
i
then
took
occasion
to
air
the
opinion
that
the
stratford
shakespeare
was
a
person
of
no
public
consequence
or
celebrity
during
his
lifetime
but
was
utterly
obscure
and
unimportant
and
not
only
in
great
london
but
also
in
the
little
village
where
he
was
born
where
he
lived
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
where
he
died
and
was
buried
i
argued
that
if
he
had
been
a
person
of
any
note
at
all
aged
villagers
would
have
had
much
to
tell
about
him
many
and
many
a
year
after
his
death
instead
of
being
unable
to
furnish
inquirers
a
single
fact
connected
with
him
i
believed
and
i
still
believe
that
if
he
had
been
famous
his
notoriety
would
have
lasted
as
long
as
mine
has
lasted
in
my
native
village
out
in
missouri
it
is
a
good
argument
a
prodigiously
strong
one
and
most
formidable
one
for
even
the
most
gifted
and
ingenious
and
plausible
stratfordolator
to
get
around
or
explain
away
today
a
hannibal
courier
post
of
recent
date
has
reached
me
with
an
article
in
it
which
reinforces
my
contention
that
a
really
celebrated
person
cannot
be
forgotten
in
his
village
in
the
short
space
of
sixty
years
i
will
make
an
extract
from
it
hannibal
as
a
city
may
have
many
sins
to
answer
for
but
ingratitude
is
not
one
of
them
or
reverence
for
the
great
men
she
has
produced
and
as
the
years
go
by
her
greatest
son
mark
twain
or
s
l
clemens
as
a
few
of
the
unlettered
call
him
grows
in
the
estimation
and
regard
of
the
residents
of
the
town
he
made
famous
and
the
town
that
made
him
famous
his
name
is
associated
with
every
old
building
that
is
torn
down
to
make
way
for
the
modern
structures
demanded
by
a
rapidly
growing
city
and
with
every
hill
or
cave
over
or
through
which
he
might
by
any
possibility
have
roamed
while
the
many
points
of
interest
which
he
wove
into
his
stories
such
as
holiday
hill
jackson's
island
or
mark
twain
cave
are
now
monuments
to
his
genius
hannibal
is
glad
of
any
opportunity
to
do
him
honor
as
he
had
honored
her
so
it
has
happened
that
the
old
timers
who
went
to
school
with
mark
or
were
with
him
on
some
of
his
usual
escapades
have
been
honored
with
large
audiences
whenever
they
were
in
a
reminiscent
mood
and
condescended
to
tell
of
their
intimacy
with
the
ordinary
boy
who
came
to
be
a
very
extraordinary
humorist
and
whose
every
boyish
act
is
now
seen
to
have
been
indicative
of
what
was
to
come
like
aunt
becky
and
mrs
clemens
they
can
now
see
that
mark
was
hardly
appreciated
when
he
lived
here
and
that
the
things
he
did
as
a
boy
and
was
whipped
for
doing
were
not
all
bad
after
all
so
they
have
been
in
no
hesitancy
about
drawing
out
the
bad
things
he
did
as
well
as
the
good
in
their
efforts
to
get
a
mark
twain
story
all
incidents
being
viewed
in
the
light
of
his
present
fame
until
the
volume
of
twainiana
is
already
considerable
and
growing
in
proportion
as
the
old
timers
drop
away
and
the
stories
are
retold
second
and
third
hand
by
their
descendants
with
some
seventy
three
years
young
and
living
in
a
villa
instead
of
a
house
he
is
a
fair
target
and
let
him
incorporate
copyright
or
patent
himself
as
he
will
there
are
some
of
his

miss
becca
blankenship
died
at
the
home
of
william
dickason
rock
street
at
o'clock
yesterday
afternoon
aged
years
the
deceased
was
a
sister
of
huckleberry
finn
one
of
the
famous
characters
in
mark
twain's
tom
sawyer
she
had
been
a
member
of
the
dickason
family
the
housekeeper
for
nearly
forty
five
years
and
was
a
highly
respected
lady
for
the
past
eight
years
she
had
been
an
invalid
but
was
as
well
cared
for
by
mr
dickason
and
his
family
as
if
she
had
been
a
near
relative
she
was
a
member
of
the
park
methodist
church
and
a
christian
woman
i
remember
her
well
i
have
a
picture
of
her
in
my
mind
which
was
graven
there
clear
and
sharp
and
vivid
sixty
three
years
ago
she
was
at
that
time
nine
years
old
and
i
was
about
eleven
i
remember
where
she
stood
and
how
she
looked
and
i
can
still
see
her
bare
feet
her
bare
head
her
brown
face
and
her
short
tow
linen
frock
she
was
crying
what
it
was
about
i
have
long
ago
forgotten
but
it
was
the
tears
that
preserved
the
picture
for
me
no
doubt
she
was
a
good
child
i
can
say
that
for
her
she
knew
me
nearly
seventy
years
ago
did
she
forget
me
in
the
course
of
time
i
think
not
if
she
had
lived
in
stratford
in
shakespeare's
time
would
she
have
forgotten
him
yes
for
he
was
never
famous
during
his
lifetime
he
was
utterly
obscure
in
stratford
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
occasion
to
remember
him
after
he
had
been
dead
a
week
injun
joe
jimmy
finn
and
general
gaines
were
prominent
and
very
intemperate
ne'er
do
weels
in
hannibal
two
generations
ago
plenty
of
grayheads
there
remember
them
to
this
day
and
can
tell
you
about
them
isn't
it
curious
that
two
town
drunkards
and
one
half
breed
loafer
should
leave
behind
them
in
a
remote
missourian
village
a
fame
a
hundred
times
greater
and
several
hundred
times
more
particularized
in
the
matter
of
definite
facts
than
shakespeare
left
behind
him
in
the
village
where
he
had
lived
the
half
of
his
lifetime
if
i
were
to
sell
the
reader
a
barrel
of
molasses
and
he
instead
of
sweetening
his
substantial
dinner
with
the
same
at
judicious
intervals
should
eat
the
entire
barrel
at
one
sitting
and
then
abuse
me
for
making
him
sick
i
would
say
that
he
deserved
to
be
made
sick
for
not
knowing
any
better
how
to
utilize
the
blessings
this
world
affords
and
if
i
sell
to
the
reader
this
volume
of
nonsense
and
he
instead
of
seasoning
his
graver
reading
with
a
chapter
of
it
now
and
then
when
his
mind
demands
such
relaxation
unwisely
overdoses
himself
with
several
chapters
of
it
at
a
single
sitting
he
will
deserve
to
be
nauseated
and
he
will
have
nobody
to
blame
but
himself
if
he
is
there
is
no
more
sin
in
publishing
an
entire
volume
of
nonsense
than
there
is
in
keeping
a
candy
store
with
no
hardware
in
it
it
lies
wholly
with
the
customer
whether
he
will
injure
himself
by
means
of
either
or
will
derive
from
them
the
benefits
which
they
will
afford
him
if
he
uses
their
possibilities
judiciously
respectfully
submitted
the
author
mark
twain's
speeches
the
story
of
a
speech
an
address
delivered
in
and
a
review
of
it
twenty
nine
years
later
the
original
speech
was
delivered
at
a
dinner
given
by
the
publishers
of
the
atlantic
monthly
in
honor
of
the
seventieth
anniversary
o
f
the
birth
of
john
greenleaf
whittier
at
the
hotel
brunswick
boston
december
this
is
an
occasion
peculiarly
meet
for
the
digging
up
of
pleasant
reminiscences
concerning
literary
folk
therefore
i
will
drop
lightly
into
history
myself
standing
here
on
the
shore
of
the
atlantic
and
contemplating
certain
of
its
largest
literary
billows
i
am
reminded
of
a
thing
which
happened
to
me
thirteen
years
ago
when
i
had
just
succeeded
in
stirring
up
a
little
nevadian
literary
puddle
myself
whose
spume
flakes
were
beginning
to
blow
thinly
californiaward
i
started
an
inspection
tramp
through
the
southern
mines
of
california
i
was
callow
and
conceited
and
i
resolved
to
try
the
virtue
of
my
nom
de
guerre
i
very
soon
had
an
opportunity
i
knocked
at
a
miner's
lonely
log
cabin
in
the
foot
hills
of
the
sierras
just
at
nightfall
it
was
snowing
at
the
time
a
jaded
melancholy
man
of
fifty
barefooted
opened
the
door
to
me
when
he
heard
my
nom
de
guerre
he
looked
more
dejected
than
before
he
let
me
in
pretty
reluctantly
i
thought
and
after
the
customary
bacon
and
beans
black
coffee
and
hot
whiskey
i
took
a
pipe
this
sorrowful
man
had
not
said
three
words
up
to
this
time
now
he
spoke
up
and
said
in
the
voice
of
one
who
is
secretly
suffering
you're
the
fourth
i'm
going
to
move
the
fourth
what
said
i
the
fourth
littery
man
that
has
been
here
in
twenty
four
hours
i'm
going
to
move
you
don't
tell
me
said
i
who
were
the
others
mr
longfellow
mr
emerson
and
mr
oliver
wendell
holmes
consound
the
lot
you
can
easily
believe
i
was
interested
i
supplicated
three
hot
whiskeys
did
the
rest
and
finally
the
melancholy
miner
began
said
he
they
came
here
just
at
dark
yesterday
evening
and
i
let
them
in
of
course
said
they
were
going
to
the
yosemite
they
were
a
rough
lot
but
that's
nothing
everybody
looks
rough
that
travels
afoot
mr
emerson
was
a
seedy
little
bit
of
a
chap
red
headed
mr
holmes
was
as
fat
as
a
balloon
he
weighed
as
much
as
three
hundred
and
had
double
chins
all
the
way
down
to
his
stomach
mr
longfellow
was
built
like
a
prizefighter
his
head
was
cropped
and
bristly
like
as
if
he
had
a
wig
made
of
hair
brushes
his
nose
lay
straight
down
his
face
like
a
finger
with
the
end
joint
tilted
up
they
had
been
drinking
i
could
see
that
and
what
queer
talk
they
used
mr
holmes
inspected
this
cabin
then
he
took
me
by
the
buttonhole
and
says
he
through
the
deep
caves
of
thought
i
hear
a
voice
that
sings
build
thee
more
stately
mansions
o
my
soul
says
i
i
can't
afford
it
mr
holmes
and
moreover
i
don't
want
to
blamed
if
i
liked
it
pretty
well
either
coming
from
a
stranger
that
way
however
i
started
to
get
out
my
bacon
and
beans
when
mr
emerson
came
and
looked
on
awhile
and
then
he
takes
me
aside
by
the
buttonhole
and
says
give
me
agates
for
my
meat
give
me
cantharids
to
eat
from
air
and
ocean
bring
me
foods
from
all
zones
and
altitudes
says
i
mr
emerson
if
you'll
excuse
me
this
ain't
no
hotel
you
see
it
sort
of
riled
me
i
warn't
used
to
the
ways
of
littery
swells
but
i
went
on
a
sweating
over
my
work
and
next
comes
mr
longfellow
and
buttonholes
me
and
interrupts
me
says
he
honor
be
to
mudjekeewis
you
shall
hear
how
pau
puk
keewis
but
i
broke
in
and
says
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
longfellow
if
you'll
be
so
kind
as
to
hold
your
yawp
for
about
five
minutes
and
let
me
get
this
grub
ready
you'll
do
me
proud
well
sir
after
they'd
filled
up
i
set
out
the
jug
mr
holmes
looks
at
it
and
then
he
fires
up
all
of
a
sudden
and
yells
flash
out
a
stream
of
blood
red
wine
for
i
would
drink
to
other
days
by
george
i
was
getting
kind
of
worked
up
i
don't
deny
it
i
was
getting
kind
of
worked
up
i
turns
to
mr
holmes
and
says
i
looky
here
my
fat
friend
i'm
a
running
this
shanty
and
if
the
court
knows
herself
you'll
take
whiskey
straight
or
you'll
go
dry
them's
the
very
words
i
said
to
him
now
i
don't
want
to
sass
such
famous
littery
people
but
you
see
they
kind
of
forced
me
there
ain't
nothing
onreasonable
bout
me
i
don't
mind
a
passel
of
guests
a
treadin
on
my
tail
three
or
four
times
but
when
it
comes
to
standing
on
it
it's
different
and
if
the
court
knows
herself
i
says
you'll
take
whiskey
straight
or
you'll
go
dry
well
between
drinks
they'd
swell
around
the
cabin
and
strike
attitudes
and
spout
and
pretty
soon
they
got
out
a
greasy
old
deck
and
went
to
playing
euchre
at
ten
cents
a
corner
on
trust
i
began
to
notice
some
pretty
suspicious
things
mr
emerson
dealt
looked
at
his
hand
shook
his
head
says
i
am
the
doubter
and
the
doubt
and
ca'mly
bunched
the
hands
and
went
to
shuffling
for
a
new
layout
says
he
they
reckon
ill
who
leave
me
out
they
know
not
well
the
subtle
ways
i
keep
i
pass
and
deal
again
hang'd
if
he
didn't
go
ahead
and
do
it
too
oh
he
was
a
cool
one
well
in
about
a
minute
things
were
running
pretty
tight
but
all
of
a
sudden
i
see
by
mr
emerson's
eye
he
judged
he
had
em
he
had
already
corralled
two
tricks
and
each
of
the
others
one
so
now
he
kind
of
lifts
a
little
in
his
chair
and
says
i
tire
of
globes
and
aces
too
long
the
game
is
played
and
down
he
fetched
a
right
bower
mr
longfellow
smiles
as
sweet
as
pie
and
says
thanks
thanks
to
thee
my
worthy
friend
for
the
lesson
thou
hast
taught
and
blamed
if
he
didn't
down
with
another
right
bower
emerson
claps
his
hand
on
his
bowie
longfellow
claps
his
on
his
revolver
and
i
went
under
a
bunk
there
was
going
to
be
trouble
but
that
monstrous
holmes
rose
up
wobbling
his
double
chins
and
says
he
order
gentlemen
the
first
man
that
draws
i'll
lay
down
on
him
and
smother
him
all
quiet
on
the
potomac
you
bet
they
were
pretty
how
come
you
so
by
now
and
they
begun
to
blow
emerson
says
the
nobbiest
thing
i
ever
wrote
was
barbara
frietchie
says
longfellow
it
don't
begin
with
my
biglow
papers
says
holmes
my
thanatopsis
lays
over
em
both
they
mighty
near
ended
in
a
fight
then
they
wished
they
had
some
more
company
and
mr
emerson
pointed
to
me
and
says
is
yonder
squalid
peasant
all
that
this
proud
nursery
could
breed
he
was
a
whetting
his
bowie
on
his
boot
so
i
let
it
pass
well
sir
next
they
took
it
into
their
heads
that
they
would
like
some
music
so
they
made
me
stand
up
and
sing
when
johnny
comes
marching
home
till
i
dropped
at
thirteen
minutes
past
four
this
morning
that's
what
i've
been
through
my
friend
when
i
woke
at
seven
they
were
leaving
thank
goodness
and
mr
longfellow
had
my
only
boots
on
and
his'n
under
his
arm
says
i
hold
on
there
evangeline
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
he
says
going
to
make
tracks
with
em
because
lives
of
great
men
all
remind
us
we
can
make
our
lives
sublime
and
departing
leave
behind
us
footprints
on
the
sands
of
time
as
i
said
mr
twain
you
are
the
fourth
in
twenty
four
hours
and
i'm
going
to
move
i
ain't
suited
to
a
littery
atmosphere
i
said
to
the
miner
why
my
dear
sir
these
were
not
the
gracious
singers
to
whom
we
and
the
world
pay
loving
reverence
and
homage
these
were
impostors
the
miner
investigated
me
with
a
calm
eye
for
a
while
then
said
he
ah
impostors
were
they
are
you
i
did
not
pursue
the
subject
and
since
then
i
have
not
travelled
on
my
nom
de
guerre
enough
to
hurt
such
was
the
reminiscence
i
was
moved
to
contribute
mr
chairman
in
my
enthusiasm
i
may
have
exaggerated
the
details
a
little
but
you
will
easily
forgive
me
that
fault
since
i
believe
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
deflected
from
perpendicular
fact
on
an
occasion
like
this
from
mark
twain's
autobiography
january
answer
to
a
letter
received
this
morning
dear
mrs
h
i
am
forever
your
debtor
for
reminding
me
of
that
curious
passage
in
my
life
during
the
first
year
or
two
after
it
happened
i
could
not
bear
to
think
of
it
my
pain
and
shame
were
so
intense
and
my
sense
of
having
been
an
imbecile
so
settled
established
and
confirmed
that
i
drove
the
episode
entirely
from
my
mind
and
so
all
these
twenty
eight
or
twenty
nine
years
i
have
lived
in
the
conviction
that
my
performance
of
that
time
was
coarse
vulgar
and
destitute
of
humor
but
your
suggestion
that
you
and
your
family
found
humor
in
it
twenty
eight
years
ago
moved
me
to
look
into
the
matter
so
i
commissioned
a
boston
typewriter
to
delve
among
the
boston
papers
of
that
bygone
time
and
send
me
a
copy
of
it
it
came
this
morning
and
if
there
is
any
vulgarity
about
it
i
am
not
able
to
discover
it
if
it
isn't
innocently
and
ridiculously
funny
i
am
no
judge
i
will
see
to
it
that
you
get
a
copy
what
i
have
said
to
mrs
h
is
true
i
did
suffer
during
a
year
or
two
from
the
deep
humiliations
of
that
episode
but
at
last
in
in
venice
my
wife
and
i
came
across
mr
and
mrs
a
p
c
of
concord
massachusetts
and
a
friendship
began
then
of
the
sort
which
nothing
but
death
terminates
the
c
s
were
very
bright
people
and
in
every
way
charming
and
companionable
we
were
together
a
month
or
two
in
venice
and
several
months
in
rome
afterward
and
one
day
that
lamented
break
of
mine
was
mentioned
and
when
i
was
on
the
point
of
lathering
those
people
for
bringing
it
to
my
mind
when
i
had
gotten
the
memory
of
it
almost
squelched
i
perceived
with
joy
that
the
c
s
were
indignant
about
the
way
that
my
performance
had
been
received
in
boston
they
poured
out
their
opinions
most
freely
and
frankly
about
the
frosty
attitude
of
the
people
who
were
present
at
that
performance
and
about
the
boston
newspapers
for
the
position
they
had
taken
in
regard
to
the
matter
that
position
was
that
i
had
been
irreverent
beyond
belief
beyond
imagination
very
well
i
had
accepted
that
as
a
fact
for
a
year
or
two
and
had
been
thoroughly
miserable
about
it
whenever
i
thought
of
it
which
was
not
frequently
if
i
could
help
it
whenever
i
thought
of
it
i
wondered
how
i
ever
could
have
been
inspired
to
do
so
unholy
a
thing
well
the
c
s
comforted
me
but
they
did
not
persuade
me
to
continue
to
think
about
the
unhappy
episode
i
resisted
that
i
tried
to
get
it
out
of
my
mind
and
let
it
die
and
i
succeeded
until
mrs
h
s
letter
came
it
had
been
a
good
twenty
five
years
since
i
had
thought
of
that
matter
and
when
she
said
that
the
thing
was
funny
i
wondered
if
possibly
she
might
be
right
at
any
rate
my
curiosity
was
aroused
and
i
wrote
to
boston
and
got
the
whole
thing
copied
as
above
set
forth
i
vaguely
remember
some
of
the
details
of
that
gathering
dimly
i
can
see
a
hundred
people
no
perhaps
fifty
shadowy
figures
sitting
at
tables
feeding
ghosts
now
to
me
and
nameless
forevermore
i
don't
know
who
they
were
but
i
can
very
distinctly
see
seated
at
the
grand
table
and
facing
the
rest
of
us
mr
emerson
supernaturally
grave
unsmiling
mr
whittier
grave
lovely
his
beautiful
spirit
shining
out
of
his
face
mr
longfellow
with
his
silken
white
hair
and
his
benignant
face
dr
oliver
wendell
holmes
flashing
smiles
and
affection
and
all
good
fellowship
everywhere
like
a
rose
diamond
whose
facets
are
being
turned
toward
the
light
first
one
way
and
then
another
a
charming
man
and
always
fascinating
whether
he
was
talking
or
whether
he
was
sitting
still
what
he
would
call
still
but
what
would
be
more
or
less
motion
to
other
people
i
can
see
those
figures
with
entire
distinctness
across
this
abyss
of
time
one
other
feature
is
clear
willie
winter
for
these
past
thousand
years
dramatic
editor
of
the
new
york
tribune
and
still
occupying
that
high
post
in
his
old
age
was
there
he
was
much
younger
then
than
he
is
now
and
he
showed
it
it
was
always
a
pleasure
to
me
to
see
willie
winter
at
a
banquet
during
a
matter
of
twenty
years
i
was
seldom
at
a
banquet
where
willie
winter
was
not
also
present
and
where
he
did
not
read
a
charming
poem
written
for
the
occasion
he
did
it
this
time
and
it
was
up
to
standard
dainty
happy
choicely
phrased
and
as
good
to
listen
to
as
music
and
sounding
exactly
as
if
it
was
pouring
unprepared
out
of
heart
and
brain
now
at
that
point
ends
all
that
was
pleasurable
about
that
notable
celebration
of
mr
whittier's
seventieth
birthday
because
i
got
up
at
that
point
and
followed
winter
with
what
i
have
no
doubt
i
supposed
would
be
the
gem
of
the
evening
the
gay
oration
above
quoted
from
the
boston
paper
i
had
written
it
all
out
the
day
before
and
had
perfectly
memorized
it
and
i
stood
up
there
at
my
genial
and
happy
and
self
satisfied
ease
and
began
to
deliver
it
those
majestic
guests
that
row
of
venerable
and
still
active
volcanoes
listened
as
did
everybody
else
in
the
house
with
attentive
interest
well
i
delivered
myself
of
we'll
say
the
first
two
hundred
words
of
my
speech
i
was
expecting
no
returns
from
that
part
of
the
speech
but
this
was
not
the
case
as
regarded
the
rest
of
it
i
arrived
now
at
the
dialogue
the
old
miner
said
you
are
the
fourth
i'm
going
to
move
the
fourth
what
said
i
he
answered
the
fourth
littery
man
that
has
been
here
in
twenty
four
hours
i
am
going
to
move
why
you
don't
tell
me
said
i
who
were
the
others
mr
longfellow
mr
emerson
mr
oliver
wendell
holmes
consound
the
lot
now
then
the
house's
attention
continued
but
the
expression
of
interest
in
the
faces
turned
to
a
sort
of
black
frost
i
wondered
what
the
trouble
was
i
didn't
know
i
went
on
but
with
difficulty
i
struggled
along
and
entered
upon
that
miner's
fearful
description
of
the
bogus
emerson
the
bogus
holmes
the
bogus
longfellow
always
hoping
but
with
a
gradually
perishing
hope
that
somebody
would
laugh
or
that
somebody
would
at
least
smile
but
nobody
did
i
didn't
know
enough
to
give
it
up
and
sit
down
i
was
too
new
to
public
speaking
and
so
i
went
on
with
this
awful
performance
and
carried
it
clear
through
to
the
end
in
front
of
a
body
of
people
who
seemed
turned
to
stone
with
horror
it
was
the
sort
of
expression
their
faces
would
have
worn
if
i
had
been
making
these
remarks
about
the
deity
and
the
rest
of
the
trinity
there
is
no
milder
way
in
which
to
describe
the
petrified
condition
and
the
ghastly
expression
of
those
people
when
i
sat
down
it
was
with
a
heart
which
had
long
ceased
to
beat
i
shall
never
be
as
dead
again
as
i
was
then
i
shall
never
be
as
miserable
again
as
i
was
then
i
speak
now
as
one
who
doesn't
know
what
the
condition
of
things
may
be
in
the
next
world
but
in
this
one
i
shall
never
be
as
wretched
again
as
i
was
then
howells
who
was
near
me
tried
to
say
a
comforting
word
but
couldn't
get
beyond
a
gasp
there
was
no
use
he
understood
the
whole
size
of
the
disaster
he
had
good
intentions
but
the
words
froze
before
they
could
get
out
it
was
an
atmosphere
that
would
freeze
anything
if
benvenuto
cellini's
salamander
had
been
in
that
place
he
would
not
have
survived
to
be
put
into
cellini's
autobiography
there
was
a
frightful
pause
there
was
an
awful
silence
a
desolating
silence
then
the
next
man
on
the
list
had
to
get
up
there
was
no
help
for
it
that
was
bishop
bishop
had
just
burst
handsomely
upon
the
world
with
a
most
acceptable
novel
which
had
appeared
in
the
atlantic
monthly
a
place
which
would
make
any
novel
respectable
and
any
author
noteworthy
in
this
case
the
novel
itself
was
recognized
as
being
without
extraneous
help
respectable
bishop
was
away
up
in
the
public
favor
and
he
was
an
object
of
high
interest
consequently
there
was
a
sort
of
national
expectancy
in
the
air
we
may
say
our
american
millions
were
standing
from
maine
to
texas
and
from
alaska
to
florida
holding
their
breath
their
lips
parted
their
hands
ready
to
applaud
when
bishop
should
get
up
on
that
occasion
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
speak
in
public
it
was
under
these
damaging
conditions
that
he
got
up
to
make
good
as
the
vulgar
say
i
had
spoken
several
times
before
and
that
is
the
reason
why
i
was
able
to
go
on
without
dying
in
my
tracks
as
i
ought
to
have
done
but
bishop
had
had
no
experience
he
was
up
facing
those
awful
deities
facing
those
other
people
those
strangers
facing
human
beings
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
with
a
speech
to
utter
no
doubt
it
was
well
packed
away
in
his
memory
no
doubt
it
was
fresh
and
usable
until
i
had
been
heard
from
i
suppose
that
after
that
and
under
the
smothering
pall
of
that
dreary
silence
it
began
to
waste
away
and
disappear
out
of
his
head
like
the
rags
breaking
from
the
edge
of
a
fog
and
presently
there
wasn't
any
fog
left
he
didn't
go
on
he
didn't
last
long
it
was
not
many
sentence's
after
his
first
before
he
began
to
hesitate
and
break
and
lose
his
grip
and
totter
and
wobble
and
at
last
he
slumped
down
in
a
limp
and
mushy
pile
well
the
programme
for
the
occasion
was
probably
not
more
than
one
third
finished
but
it
ended
there
nobody
rose
the
next
man
hadn't
strength
enough
to
get
up
and
everybody
looked
so
dazed
so
stupefied
paralyzed
it
was
impossible
for
anybody
to
do
anything
or
even
try
nothing
could
go
on
in
that
strange
atmosphere
howells
mournfully
and
without
words
hitched
himself
to
bishop
and
me
and
supported
us
out
of
the
room
it
was
very
kind
he
was
most
generous
he
towed
us
tottering
away
into
some
room
in
that
building
and
we
sat
down
there
i
don't
know
what
my
remark
was
now
but
i
know
the
nature
of
it
it
was
the
kind
of
remark
you
make
when
you
know
that
nothing
in
the
world
can
help
your
case
but
howells
was
honest
he
had
to
say
the
heart
breaking
things
he
did
say
that
there
was
no
help
for
this
calamity
this
shipwreck
this
cataclysm
that
this
was
the
most
disastrous
thing
that
had
ever
happened
in
anybody's
history
and
then
he
added
that
is
for
you
and
consider
what
you
have
done
for
bishop
it
is
bad
enough
in
your
case
you
deserve
to
suffer
you
have
committed
this
crime
and
you
deserve
to
have
all
you
are
going
to
get
but
here
is
an
innocent
man
bishop
had
never
done
you
any
harm
and
see
what
you
have
done
to
him
he
can
never
hold
his
head
up
again
the
world
can
never
look
upon
bishop
as
being
a
live
person
he
is
a
corpse
that
is
the
history
of
that
episode
of
twenty
eight
years
ago
which
pretty
nearly
killed
me
with
shame
during
that
first
year
or
two
whenever
it
forced
its
way
into
my
mind
now
then
i
take
that
speech
up
and
examine
it
as
i
said
it
arrived
this
morning
from
boston
i
have
read
it
twice
and
unless
i
am
an
idiot
it
hasn't
a
single
defect
in
it
from
the
first
word
to
the
last
it
is
just
as
good
as
good
can
be
it
is
smart
it
is
saturated
with
humor
there
isn't
a
suggestion
of
coarseness
or
vulgarity
in
it
anywhere
what
could
have
been
the
matter
with
that
house
it
is
amazing
it
is
incredible
that
they
didn't
shout
with
laughter
and
those
deities
the
loudest
of
them
all
could
the
fault
have
been
with
me
did
i
lose
courage
when
i
saw
those
great
men
up
there
whom
i
was
going
to
describe
in
such
a
strange
fashion
if
that
happened
if
i
showed
doubt
that
can
account
for
it
for
you
can't
be
successfully
funny
if
you
show
that
you
are
afraid
of
it
well
i
can't
account
for
it
but
if
i
had
those
beloved
and
revered
old
literary
immortals
back
here
now
on
the
platform
at
carnegie
hall
i
would
take
that
same
old
speech
deliver
it
word
for
word
and
melt
them
till
they'd
run
all
over
that
stage
oh
the
fault
must
have
been
with
me
it
is
not
in
the
speech
at
all
plymouth
rock
and
the
pilgrims
address
at
the
first
annual
dinner
n
e
society
philadelphia
december
on
calling
upon
mr
clemens
to
make
response
president
rollins
said
this
sentiment
has
been
assigned
to
one
who
was
never
exactly
born
in
new
england
nor
perhaps
were
any
of
his
ancestors
he
is
not
technically
therefore
of
new
england
descent
under
the
painful
circumstances
in
which
he
has
found
himself
however
he
has
done
the
best
he
could
he
has
had
all
his
children
born
there
and
has
made
of
himself
a
new
england
ancestor
he
is
a
self
made
man
more
than
this
and
better
even
in
cheerful
hopeful
helpful
literature
he
is
of
new
england
ascent
to
ascend
there
in
any
thing
that's
reasonable
is
difficult
for
confidentially
with
the
door
shut
we
all
know
that
they
are
the
brightest
ablest
sons
of
that
goodly
land
who
never
leave
it
and
it
is
among
and
above
them
that
mr
twain
has
made
his
brilliant
and
permanent
ascent
become
a
man
of
mark
i
rise
to
protest
i
have
kept
still
for
years
but
really
i
think
there
is
no
sufficient
justification
for
this
sort
of
thing
what
do
you
want
to
celebrate
those
people
for
those
ancestors
of
yours
of
the
mayflower
tribe
i
mean
what
do
you
want
to
celebrate
them
for
your
pardon
the
gentleman
at
my
left
assures
me
that
you
are
not
celebrating
the
pilgrims
themselves
but
the
landing
of
the
pilgrims
at
plymouth
rock
on
the
of
december
so
you
are
celebrating
their
landing
why
the
other
pretext
was
thin
enough
but
this
is
thinner
than
ever
the
other
was
tissue
tinfoil
fish
bladder
but
this
is
gold
leaf
celebrating
their
lauding
what
was
there
remarkable
about
it
i
would
like
to
know
what
can
you
be
thinking
of
why
those
pilgrims
had
been
at
sea
three
or
four
months
it
was
the
very
middle
of
winter
it
was
as
cold
as
death
off
cape
cod
there
why
shouldn't
they
come
ashore
if
they
hadn't
landed
there
would
be
some
reason
for
celebrating
the
fact
it
would
have
been
a
case
of
monumental
leatherheadedness
which
the
world
would
not
willingly
let
die
if
it
had
been
you
gentlemen
you
probably
wouldn't
have
landed
but
you
have
no
shadow
of
right
to
be
celebrating
in
your
ancestors
gifts
which
they
did
not
exercise
but
only
transmitted
why
to
be
celebrating
the
mere
landing
of
the
pilgrims
to
be
trying
to
make
out
that
this
most
natural
and
simple
and
customary
procedure
was
an
extraordinary
circumstance
a
circumstance
to
be
amazed
at
and
admired
aggrandized
and
glorified
at
orgies
like
this
for
two
hundred
and
sixty
years
hang
it
a
horse
would
have
known
enough
to
land
a
horse
pardon
again
the
gentleman
on
my
right
assures
me
that
it
was
not
merely
the
landing
of
the
pilgrims
that
we
are
celebrating
but
the
pilgrims
themselves
so
we
have
struck
an
inconsistency
here
one
says
it
was
the
landing
the
other
says
it
was
the
pilgrims
it
is
an
inconsistency
characteristic
of
your
intractable
and
disputatious
tribe
for
you
never
agree
about
anything
but
boston
well
then
what
do
you
want
to
celebrate
those
pilgrims
for
they
were
a
mighty
hard
lot
you
know
it
i
grant
you
without
the
slightest
unwillingness
that
they
were
a
deal
more
gentle
and
merciful
and
just
than
were
the
people
of
europe
of
that
day
i
grant
you
that
they
are
better
than
their
predecessors
but
what
of
that
that
is
nothing
people
always
progress
you
are
better
than
your
fathers
and
grandfathers
were
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
aimed
a
measureless
slander
at
the
departed
for
i
consider
such
things
improper
yes
those
among
you
who
have
not
been
in
the
penitentiary
if
such
there
be
are
better
than
your
fathers
and
grandfathers
were
but
is
that
any
sufficient
reason
for
getting
up
annual
dinners
and
celebrating
you
no
by
no
means
by
no
means
well
i
repeat
those
pilgrims
were
a
hard
lot
they
took
good
care
of
themselves
but
they
abolished
everybody
else's
ancestors
i
am
a
border
ruffian
from
the
state
of
missouri
i
am
a
connecticut
yankee
by
adoption
in
me
you
have
missouri
morals
connecticut
culture
this
gentlemen
is
the
combination
which
makes
the
perfect
man
but
where
are
my
ancestors
whom
shall
i
celebrate
where
shall
i
find
the
raw
material
my
first
american
ancestor
gentlemen
was
an
indian
an
early
indian
your
ancestors
skinned
him
alive
and
i
am
an
orphan
not
one
drop
of
my
blood
flows
in
that
indian's
veins
today
i
stand
here
lone
and
forlorn
without
an
ancestor
they
skinned
him
i
do
not
object
to
that
if
they
needed
his
fur
but
alive
gentlemen
alive
they
skinned
him
alive
and
before
company
that
is
what
rankles
think
how
he
must
have
felt
for
he
was
a
sensitive
person
and
easily
embarrassed
if
he
had
been
a
bird
it
would
have
been
all
right
and
no
violence
done
to
his
feelings
because
he
would
have
been
considered
dressed
but
he
was
not
a
bird
gentlemen
he
was
a
man
and
probably
one
of
the
most
undressed
men
that
ever
was
i
ask
you
to
put
yourselves
in
his
place
i
ask
it
as
a
favor
i
ask
it
as
a
tardy
act
of
justice
i
ask
it
in
the
interest
of
fidelity
to
the
traditions
of
your
ancestors
i
ask
it
that
the
world
may
contemplate
with
vision
unobstructed
by
disguising
swallow
tails
and
white
cravats
the
spectacle
which
the
true
new
england
society
ought
to
present
cease
to
come
to
these
annual
orgies
in
this
hollow
modern
mockery
the
surplusage
of
raiment
come
in
character
come
in
the
summer
grace
come
in
the
unadorned
simplicity
come
in
the
free
and
joyous
costume
which
your
sainted
ancestors
provided
for
mine
later
ancestors
of
mine
were
the
quakers
william
robinson
marmaduke
stevenson
et
al
your
tribe
chased
them
out
of
the
country
for
their
religion's
sake
promised
them
death
if
they
came
back
for
your
ancestors
had
forsaken
the
homes
they
loved
and
braved
the
perils
of
the
sea
the
implacable
climate
and
the
savage
wilderness
to
acquire
that
highest
and
most
precious
of
boons
freedom
for
every
man
on
this
broad
continent
to
worship
according
to
the
dictates
of
his
own
conscience
and
they
were
not
going
to
allow
a
lot
of
pestiferous
quakers
to
interfere
with
it
your
ancestors
broke
forever
the
chains
of
political
slavery
and
gave
the
vote
to
every
man
in
this
wide
land
excluding
none
none
except
those
who
did
not
belong
to
the
orthodox
church
your
ancestors
yes
they
were
a
hard
lot
but
nevertheless
they
gave
us
religious
liberty
to
worship
as
they
required
us
to
worship
and
political
liberty
to
vote
as
the
church
required
and
so
i
the
bereft
one
i
the
forlorn
one
am
here
to
do
my
best
to
help
you
celebrate
them
right
the
quaker
woman
elizabeth
hooton
was
an
ancestress
of
mine
your
people
were
pretty
severe
with
her
you
will
confess
that
but
poor
thing
i
believe
they
changed
her
opinions
before
she
died
and
took
her
into
their
fold
and
so
we
have
every
reason
to
presume
that
when
she
died
she
went
to
the
same
place
which
your
ancestors
went
to
it
is
a
great
pity
for
she
was
a
good
woman
roger
williams
was
an
ancestor
of
mine
i
don't
really
remember
what
your
people
did
with
him
but
they
banished
him
to
rhode
island
anyway
and
then
i
believe
recognizing
that
this
was
really
carrying
harshness
to
an
unjustifiable
extreme
they
took
pity
on
him
and
burned
him
they
were
a
hard
lot
all
those
salem
witches
were
ancestors
of
mine
your
people
made
it
tropical
for
them
yes
they
did
by
pressure
and
the
gallows
they
made
such
a
clean
deal
with
them
that
there
hasn't
been
a
witch
and
hardly
a
halter
in
our
family
from
that
day
to
this
and
that
is
one
hundred
and
eighty
nine
years
the
first
slave
brought
into
new
england
out
of
africa
by
your
progenitors
was
an
ancestor
of
mine
for
i
am
of
a
mixed
breed
an
infinitely
shaded
and
exquisite
mongrel
i'm
not
one
of
your
sham
meerschaums
that
you
can
color
in
a
week
no
my
complexion
is
the
patient
art
of
eight
generations
well
in
my
own
time
i
had
acquired
a
lot
of
my
kin
by
purchase
and
swapping
around
and
one
way
and
another
and
was
getting
along
very
well
then
with
the
inborn
perversity
of
your
lineage
you
got
up
a
war
and
took
them
all
away
from
me
and
so
again
am
i
bereft
again
am
i
forlorn
no
drop
of
my
blood
flows
in
the
veins
of
any
living
being
who
is
marketable
o
my
friends
hear
me
and
reform
i
seek
your
good
not
mine
you
have
heard
the
speeches
disband
these
new
england
societies
nurseries
of
a
system
of
steadily
augmenting
laudation
and
hosannaing
which
if
persisted
in
uncurbed
may
some
day
in
the
remote
future
beguile
you
into
prevaricating
and
bragging
oh
stop
stop
while
you
are
still
temperate
in
your
appreciation
of
your
ancestors
hear
me
i
beseech
you
get
up
an
auction
and
sell
plymouth
rock
the
pilgrims
were
a
simple
and
ignorant
race
they
never
had
seen
any
good
rocks
before
or
at
least
any
that
were
not
watched
and
so
they
were
excusable
for
hopping
ashore
in
frantic
delight
and
clapping
an
iron
fence
around
this
one
but
you
gentlemen
are
educated
you
are
enlightened
you
know
that
in
the
rich
land
of
your
nativity
opulent
new
england
overflowing
with
rocks
this
one
isn't
worth
at
the
outside
more
than
thirty
five
cents
therefore
sell
it
before
it
is
injured
by
exposure
or
at
least
throw
it
open
to
the
patent
medicine
advertisements
and
let
it
earn
its
taxes
yes
hear
your
true
friend
your
only
true
friend
list
to
his
voice
disband
these
societies
hotbeds
of
vice
of
moral
decay
perpetuators
of
ancestral
superstition
here
on
this
board
i
see

i
see

i
see
the
wild
and
deadly
lemonade
these
are
but
steps
upon
the
downward

next
we
shall
see

my

late
you
are
on
the
broad
road
which
leads
to
dissipation
physical
ruin

gory
crime
and
the
gallows
i
beseech
you
i
implore
you
in
the
name
of
your
anxious
friends
in
the
name
of
your
suffering
families
in
the
name
of
your
impending

disband
these
new

societies
renounce
these
soul
blistering
saturnalia
cease
from
varnishing
the
rusty
reputations
of
your
long
vanished
ancestors
the
super
high
moral
old
iron
clads
of
cape
cod
the
pious
buccaneers
of
plymouth
rock
go
home
and
try
to
learn
to
behave
however
chaff
and
nonsense
aside
i
think
i
honor
and
appreciate
your
pilgrim
stock
as
much
as
you
do
yourselves
perhaps
and
i
endorse
and
adopt
a
sentiment
uttered
by
a
grandfather
of
mine
once
a
man
of
sturdy
opinions
of
sincere
make
of
mind
and
not
given
to
flattery
he
said
people
may
talk
as
they
like
about
that
pilgrim
stock
but
after
all's
said
and
done
it
would
be
pretty
hard
to
improve
on
those
people
and
as
for
me
i
don't
mind
coming
out
flatfooted
and
saying
there
ain't
any
way
to
improve
on
them
except
having
them
born
in
missouri
compliments
and
degrees
delivered
at
the
lotos
club
january
in
introducing
mr
clemens
frank
r
lawrence
the
president
of
the
lotos
club
recalled
the
fact
that
the
first
club
dinner
in
the
present
club
house
some
fourteen
years
ago
was
in
honor
of
mark
twain
i
wish
to
begin
this
time
at
the
beginning
lest
i
forget
it
altogether
that
is
to
say
i
wish
to
thank
you
for
this
welcome
that
you
are
giving
and
the
welcome
which
you
gave
me
seven
years
ago
and
which
i
forgot
to
thank
you
for
at
that
time
i
also
wish
to
thank
you
for
the
welcome
you
gave
me
fourteen
years
ago
which
i
also
forgot
to
thank
you
for
at
the
time
i
hope
you
will
continue
this
custom
to
give
me
a
dinner
every
seven
years
before
i
join
the
hosts
in
the
other
world
i
do
not
know
which
world
mr
lawrence
and
mr
porter
have
paid
me
many
compliments
it
is
very
difficult
to
take
compliments
i
do
not
care
whether
you
deserve
the
compliments
or
not
it
is
just
as
difficult
to
take
them
the
other
night
i
was
at
the
engineers
club
and
enjoyed
the
sufferings
of
mr
carnegie
they
were
complimenting
him
there
there
it
was
all
compliments
and
none
of
them
deserved
they
say
that
you
cannot
live
by
bread
alone
but
i
can
live
on
compliments
i
do
not
make
any
pretence
that
i
dislike
compliments
the
stronger
the
better
and
i
can
manage
to
digest
them
i
think
i
have
lost
so
much
by
not
making
a
collection
of
compliments
to
put
them
away
and
take
them
out
again
once
in
a
while
when
in
england
i
said
that
i
would
start
to
collect
compliments
and
i
began
there
and
i
have
brought
some
of
them
along
the
first
one
of
these
lies
i
wrote
them
down
and
preserved
them
i
think
they
are
mighty
good
and
extremely
just
it
is
one
of
hamilton
mabie's
compliments
he
said
that
la
salle
was
the
first
one
to
make
a
voyage
of
the
mississippi
but
mark
twain
was
the
first
to
chart
light
and
navigate
it
for
the
whole
world
if
that
had
been
published
at
the
time
that
i
issued
that
book
on
the
it
would
have
been
money
in
my
pocket
i
tell
you
it
is
a
talent
by
itself
to
pay
compliments
gracefully
and
have
them
ring
true
it's
an
art
by
itself
here
is
another
compliment
by
albert
bigelow
paine
my
biographer
he
is
writing
four
octavo
volumes
about
me
and
he
has
been
at
my
elbow
two
and
one
half
years
i
just
suppose
that
he
does
not
know
me
but
says
he
knows
me
he
says
mark
twain
is
not
merely
a
great
writer
a
great
philosopher
a
great
man
he
is
the
supreme
expression
of
the
human
being
with
his
strength
and
his
weakness
what
a
talent
for
compression
it
takes
a
genius
in
compression
to
compact
as
many
facts
as
that
w
d
howells
spoke
of
me
as
first
of
hartford
and
ultimately
of
the
solar
system
not
to
say
of
the
universe
you
know
how
modest
howells
is
if
it
can
be
proved
that
my
fame
reaches
to
neptune
and
saturn
that
will
satisfy
even
me
you
know
how
modest
and
retiring
howells
seems
to
be
but
deep
down
he
is
as
vain
as
i
am
mr
howells
had
been
granted
a
degree
at
oxford
whose
gown
was
red
he
had
been
invited
to
an
exercise
at
columbia
and
upon
inquiry
had
been
told
that
it
was
usual
to
wear
the
black
gown
later
he
had
found
that
three
other
men
wore
bright
gowns
and
he
had
lamented
that
he
had
been
one
of
the
black
mass
and
not
a
red
torch
edison
wrote
the
average
american
loves
his
family
if
he
has
any
love
left
over
for
some
other
person
he
generally
selects
mark
twain
now
here's
the
compliment
of
a
little
montana
girl
which
came
to
me
indirectly
she
was
in
a
room
in
which
there
was
a
large
photograph
of
me
after
gazing
at
it
steadily
for
a
time
she
said
we've
got
a
john
the
baptist
like
that
she
also
said
only
ours
has
more
trimmings
i
suppose
she
meant
the
halo
now
here
is
a
gold
miner's
compliment
it
is
forty
two
years
old
it
was
my
introduction
to
an
audience
to
which
i
lectured
in
a
log
school
house
there
were
no
ladies
there
i
wasn't
famous
then
they
didn't
know
me
only
the
miners
were
there
with
their
breeches
tucked
into
their
boottops
and
with
clay
all
over
them
they
wanted
some
one
to
introduce
me
and
they
selected
a
miner
who
protested
saying
i
don't
know
anything
about
this
man
anyhow
i
only
know
two
things
about
him
one
is
he
has
never
been
in
jail
and
the
other
is
i
don't
know
why
there's
one
thing
i
want
to
say
about
that
english
trip
i
knew
his
majesty
the
king
of
england
long
years
ago
and
i
didn't
meet
him
for
the
first
time
then
one
thing
that
i
regret
was
that
some
newspapers
said
i
talked
with
the
queen
of
england
with
my
hat
on
i
don't
do
that
with
any
woman
i
did
not
put
it
on
until
she
asked
me
to
then
she
told
me
to
put
it
on
and
it's
a
command
there
i
thought
i
had
carried
my
american
democracy
far
enough
so
i
put
it
on
i
have
no
use
for
a
hat
and
never
did
have
who
was
it
who
said
that
the
police
of
london
knew
me
why
the
police
know
me
everywhere
there
never
was
a
day
over
there
when
a
policeman
did
not
salute
me
and
then
put
up
his
hand
and
stop
the
traffic
of
the
world
they
treated
me
as
though
i
were
a
duchess
the
happiest
experience
i
had
in
england
was
at
a
dinner
given
in
the
building
of
the
punch
publication
a
humorous
paper
which
is
appreciated
by
all
englishmen
it
was
the
greatest
privilege
ever
allowed
a
foreigner
i
entered
the
dining
room
of
the
building
where
those
men
get
together
who
have
been
running
the
paper
for
over
fifty
years
we
were
about
to
begin
dinner
when
the
toastmaster
said
just
a
minute
there
ought
to
be
a
little
ceremony
then
there
was
that
meditating
silence
for
a
while
and
out
of
a
closet
there
came
a
beautiful
little
girl
dressed
in
pink
holding
in
her
hand
a
copy
of
the
previous
week's
paper
which
had
in
it
my
cartoon
it
broke
me
all
up
i
could
not
even
say
thank
you
that
was
the
prettiest
incident
of
the
dinner
the
delight
of
all
that
wonderful
table
when
she
was
about
to
go
i
said
my
child
you
are
not
going
to
leave
me
i
have
hardly
got
acquainted
with
you
she
replied
you
know
i've
got
to
go
they
never
let
me
come
in
here
before
and
they
never
will
again
that
is
one
of
the
beautiful
incidents
that
i
cherish
the
conclusion
of
his
speech
and
while
the
diners
were
still
cheering
him
colonel
porter
brought
forward
the
red
and
gray
gown
of
the
oxford
doctor
and
mr
clemens
was
made
to
don
it
the
diners
rose
to
their
feet
in
their
enthusiasm
with
the
mortar
board
on
his
head
and
looking
down
admiringly
at
himself
mr
twain
said
i
like
that
gown
i
always
did
like
red
the
redder
it
is
the
better
i
like
it
i
was
born
for
a
savage
now
whoever
saw
any
red
like
this
there
is
no
red
outside
the
arteries
of
an
archangel
that
could
compare
with
this
i
know
you
all
envy
me
i
am
going
to
have
luncheon
shortly
with
ladies
just
ladies
i
will
be
the
only
lady
of
my
sex
present
and
i
shall
put
on
this
gown
and
make
those
ladies
look
dim
books
authors
and
hats
address
at
the
pilgrims
club
luncheon
given
in
honor
of
mr
clemens
at
the
savoy
hotel
london
june
mr
birrell
m
p
chief
secretary
for
ireland
in
introducing
mr
clemens
said
we
all
love
mark
twain
and
we
are
here
to
tell
him
so
one
more
point
all
the
world
knows
it
and
that
is
why
it
is
dangerous
to
omit
it
our
guest
is
a
distinguished
citizen
of
the
great
republic
beyond
the
seas
in
america
his
huckleberry
finn
and
his
tom
sawyer
are
what
robinson
crusoe
and
tom
brown's
school
days
have
been
to
us
they
are
racy
of
the
soil
they
are
books
to
which
it
is
impossible
to
place
any
period
of
termination
i
will
not
speak
of
the
classics
reminiscences
of
much
evil
in
our
early
lives
we
do
not
meet
here
to
day
as
critics
with
our
appreciations
and
depreciations
our
twopenny
little
prefaces
or
our
forewords
i
am
not
going
to
say
what
the
world
a
thousand
years
hence
will
think
of
mark
twain
posterity
will
take
care
of
itself
will
read
what
it
wants
to
read
will
forget
what
it
chooses
to
forget
and
will
pay
no
attention
whatsoever
to
our
critical
mumblings
and
jumblings
let
us
therefore
be
content
to
say
to
our
friend
and
guest
that
we
are
here
speaking
for
ourselves
and
for
our
children
to
say
what
he
has
been
to
us
i
remember
in
liverpool
in
first
buying
the
copy
which
i
still
preserve
of
the
celebrated
jumping
frog
it
had
a
few
words
of
preface
which
reminded
me
then
that
our
guest
in
those
days
was
called
the
wild
humorist
of
the
pacific
slope
and
a
few
lines
later
down
the
moralist
of
the
main
that
was
some
forty
years
ago
here
he
is
still
the
humorist
still
the
moralist
his
humor
enlivens
and
enlightens
his
morality
and
his
morality
is
all
the
better
for
his
humor
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
love
him
i
am
not
here
to
mention
any
book
of
his
that
is
a
subject
of
dispute
in
my
family
circle
which
is
the
best
and
which
is
the
next
best
but
i
must
put
in
a
word
lest
i
should
not
be
true
to
myself
a
terrible
thing
for
his
joan
of
arc
a
book
of
chivalry
of
nobility
and
of
manly
sincerity
for
which
i
take
this
opportunity
of
thanking
him
but
you
can
all
drink
this
toast
each
one
of
you
with
his
own
intention
you
can
get
into
it
what
meaning
you
like
mark
twain
is
a
man
whom
english
and
americans
do
well
to
honor
he
is
the
true
consolidator
of
nations
his
delightful
humor
is
of
the
kind
which
dissipates
and
destroys
national
prejudices
his
truth
and
his
honor
his
love
of
truth
and
his
love
of
honor
overflow
all
boundaries
he
has
made
the
world
better
by
his
presence
we
rejoice
to
see
him
here
long
may
he
live
to
reap
the
plentiful
harvest
of
hearty
honest
human
affection
pilgrims
i
desire
first
to
thank
those
undergraduates
of
oxford
when
a
man
has
grown
so
old
as
i
am
when
he
has
reached
the
verge
of
seventy
two
years
there
is
nothing
that
carries
him
back
to
the
dreamland
of
his
life
to
his
boyhood
like
recognition
of
those
young
hearts
up
yonder
and
so
i
thank
them
out
of
my
heart
i
desire
to
thank
the
pilgrims
of
new
york
also
for
their
kind
notice
and
message
which
they
have
cabled
over
here
mr
birrell
says
he
does
not
know
how
he
got
here
but
he
will
be
able
to
get
away
all
right
he
has
not
drunk
anything
since
he
came
here
i
am
glad
to
know
about
those
friends
of
his
otway
and
chatterton
fresh
new
names
to
me
i
am
glad
of
the
disposition
he
has
shown
to
rescue
them
from
the
evils
of
poverty
and
if
they
are
still
in
london
i
hope
to
have
a
talk
with
them
for
a
while
i
thought
he
was
going
to
tell
us
the
effect
which
my
book
had
upon
his
growing
manhood
i
thought
he
was
going
to
tell
us
how
much
that
effect
amounted
to
and
whether
it
really
made
him
what
he
now
is
but
with
the
discretion
born
of
parliamentary
experience
he
dodged
that
and
we
do
not
know
now
whether
he
read
the
book
or
not
he
did
that
very
neatly
i
could
not
do
it
any
better
myself
my
books
have
had
effects
and
very
good
ones
too
here
and
there
and
some
others
not
so
good
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
but
i
remember
one
monumental
instance
of
it
years
and
years
ago
professor
norton
of
harvard
was
over
here
and
when
he
came
back
to
boston
i
went
out
with
howells
to
call
on
him
norton
was
allied
in
some
way
by
marriage
with
darwin
mr
norton
was
very
gentle
in
what
he
had
to
say
and
almost
delicate
and
he
said
mr
clemens
i
have
been
spending
some
time
with
mr
darwin
in
england
and
i
should
like
to
tell
you
something
connected
with
that
visit
you
were
the
object
of
it
and
i
myself
would
have
been
very
proud
of
it
but
you
may
not
be
proud
of
it
at
any
rate
i
am
going
to
tell
you
what
it
was
and
to
leave
to
you
to
regard
it
as
you
please
mr
darwin
took
me
up
to
his
bedroom
and
pointed
out
certain
things
there
pitcher
plants
and
so
on
that
he
was
measuring
and
watching
from
day
to
day
and
he
said
the
chambermaid
is
permitted
to
do
what
she
pleases
in
this
room
but
she
must
never
touch
those
plants
and
never
touch
those
books
on
that
table
by
that
candle
with
those
books
i
read
myself
to
sleep
every
night
those
were
your
own
books
i
said
there
is
no
question
to
my
mind
as
to
whether
i
should
regard
that
as
a
compliment
or
not
i
do
regard
it
as
a
very
great
compliment
and
a
very
high
honor
that
that
great
mind
laboring
for
the
whole
human
race
should
rest
itself
on
my
books
i
am
proud
that
he
should
read
himself
to
sleep
with
them
now
i
could
not
keep
that
to
myself
i
was
so
proud
of
it
as
soon
as
i
got
home
to
hartford
i
called
up
my
oldest
friend
and
dearest
enemy
on
occasion
the
rev
joseph
twichell
my
pastor
and
i
told
him
about
that
and
of
course
he
was
full
of
interest
and
venom
those
people
who
get
no
compliments
like
that
feel
like
that
he
went
off
he
did
not
issue
any
applause
of
any
kind
and
i
did
not
hear
of
that
subject
for
some
time
but
when
mr
darwin
passed
away
from
this
life
and
some
time
after
darwin's
life
and
letters
came
out
the
rev
mr
twichell
procured
an
early
copy
of
that
work
and
found
something
in
it
which
he
considered
applied
to
me
he
came
over
to
my
house
it
was
snowing
raining
sleeting
but
that
did
not
make
any
difference
to
twichell
he
produced
the
book
and
turned
over
and
over
until
he
came
to
a
certain
place
when
he
said
here
look
at
this
letter
from
mr
darwin
to
sir
joseph
hooker
what
mr
darwin
said
i
give
you
the
idea
and
not
the
very
words
was
this
i
do
not
know
whether
i
ought
to
have
devoted
my
whole
life
to
these
drudgeries
in
natural
history
and
the
other
sciences
or
not
for
while
i
may
have
gained
in
one
way
i
have
lost
in
another
once
i
had
a
fine
perception
and
appreciation
of
high
literature
but
in
me
that
quality
is
atrophied
that
was
the
reason
said
mr
twichell
he
was
reading
your
books
mr
birrell
has
touched
lightly
very
lightly
but
in
not
an
uncomplimentary
way
on
my
position
in
this
world
as
a
moralist
i
am
glad
to
have
that
recognition
too
because
i
have
suffered
since
i
have
been
in
this
town
in
the
first
place
right
away
when
i
came
here
from
a
newsman
going
around
with
a
great
red
highly
displayed
placard
in
the
place
of
an
apron
he
was
selling
newspapers
and
there
were
two
sentences
on
that
placard
which
would
have
been
all
right
if
they
had
been
punctuated
but
they
ran
those
two
sentences
together
without
a
comma
or
anything
and
that
would
naturally
create
a
wrong
impression
because
it
said
mark
twain
arrives
ascot
cup
stolen
no
doubt
many
a
person
was
misled
by
those
sentences
joined
together
in
that
unkind
way
i
have
no
doubt
my
character
has
suffered
from
it
i
suppose
i
ought
to
defend
my
character
but
how
can
i
defend
it
i
can
say
here
and
now
and
anybody
can
see
by
my
face
that
i
am
sincere
that
i
speak
the
truth
that
i
have
never
seen
that
cup
i
have
not
got
the
cup
i
did
not
have
a
chance
to
get
it
i
have
always
had
a
good
character
in
that
way
i
have
hardly
ever
stolen
anything
and
if
i
did
steal
anything
i
had
discretion
enough
to
know
about
the
value
of
it
first
i
do
not
steal
things
that
are
likely
to
get
myself
into
trouble
i
do
not
think
any
of
us
do
that
i
know
we
all
take
things
that
is
to
be
expected
but
really
i
have
never
taken
anything
certainly
in
england
that
amounts
to
any
great
thing
i
do
confess
that
when
i
was
here
seven
years
ago
i
stole
a
hat
but
that
did
not
amount
to
anything
it
was
not
a
good
hat
and
was
only
a
clergyman's
hat
anyway
i
was
at
a
luncheon
party
and
archdeacon
wilberforce
was
there
also
i
dare
say
he
is
archdeacon
now
he
was
a
canon
then
and
he
was
serving
in
the
westminster
battery
if
that
is
the
proper
term
i
do
not
know
as
you
mix
military
and
ecclesiastical
things
together
so
much
he
left
the
luncheon
table
before
i
did
he
began
this
i
did
steal
his
hat
but
he
began
by
taking
mine
i
make
that
interjection
because
i
would
not
accuse
archdeacon
wilberforce
of
stealing
my
hat
i
should
not
think
of
it
i
confine
that
phrase
to
myself
he
merely
took
my
hat
and
with
good
judgment
too
it
was
a
better
hat
than
his
he
came
out
before
the
luncheon
was
over
and
sorted
the
hats
in
the
hall
and
selected
one
which
suited
it
happened
to
be
mine
he
went
off
with
it
when
i
came
out
by
and
by
there
was
no
hat
there
which
would
go
on
my
head
except
his
which
was
left
behind
my
head
was
not
the
customary
size
just
at
that
time
i
had
been
receiving
a
good
many
very
nice
and
complimentary
attentions
and
my
head
was
a
couple
of
sizes
larger
than
usual
and
his
hat
just
suited
me
the
bumps
and
corners
were
all
right
intellectually
there
were
results
pleasing
to
me
possibly
so
to
him
he
found
out
whose
hat
it
was
and
wrote
me
saying
it
was
pleasant
that
all
the
way
home
whenever
he
met
anybody
his
gravities
his
solemnities
his
deep
thoughts
his
eloquent
remarks
were
all
snatched
up
by
the
people
he
met
and
mistaken
for
brilliant
humorisms
i
had
another
experience
it
was
not
unpleasing
i
was
received
with
a
deference
which
was
entirely
foreign
to
my
experience
by
everybody
whom
i
met
so
that
before
i
got
home
i
had
a
much
higher
opinion
of
myself
than
i
have
ever
had
before
or
since
and
there
is
in
that
very
connection
an
incident
which
i
remember
at
that
old
date
which
is
rather
melancholy
to
me
because
it
shows
how
a
person
can
deteriorate
in
a
mere
seven
years
it
is
seven
years
ago
i
have
not
that
hat
now
i
was
going
down
pall
mall
or
some
other
of
your
big
streets
and
i
recognized
that
that
hat
needed
ironing
i
went
into
a
big
shop
and
passed
in
my
hat
and
asked
that
it
might
be
ironed
they
were
courteous
very
courteous
even
courtly
they
brought
that
hat
back
to
me
presently
very
sleek
and
nice
and
i
asked
how
much
there
was
to
pay
they
replied
that
they
did
not
charge
the
clergy
anything
i
have
cherished
the
delight
of
that
moment
from
that
day
to
this
it
was
the
first
thing
i
did
the
other
day
to
go
and
hunt
up
that
shop
and
hand
in
my
hat
to
have
it
ironed
i
said
when
it
came
back
how
much
to
pay
they
said
ninepence
in
seven
years
i
have
acquired
all
that
worldliness
and
i
am
sorry
to
be
back
where
i
was
seven
years
ago
but
now
i
am
chaffing
and
chaffing
and
chaffing
here
and
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
for
that
but
when
a
man
stands
on
the
verge
of
seventy
two
you
know
perfectly
well
that
he
never
reached
that
place
without
knowing
what
this
life
is
heart
breaking
bereavement
and
so
our
reverence
is
for
our
dead
we
do
not
forget
them
but
our
duty
is
toward
the
living
and
if
we
can
be
cheerful
cheerful
in
spirit
cheerful
in
speech
and
in
hope
that
is
a
benefit
to
those
who
are
around
us
my
own
history
includes
an
incident
which
will
always
connect
me
with
england
in
a
pathetic
way
for
when
i
arrived
here
seven
years
ago
with
my
wife
and
my
daughter
we
had
gone
around
the
globe
lecturing
to
raise
money
to
clear
off
a
debt
my
wife
and
one
of
my
daughters
started
across
the
ocean
to
bring
to
england
our
eldest
daughter
she
was
twenty
four
years
of
age
and
in
the
bloom
of
young
womanhood
and
we
were
unsuspecting
when
my
wife
and
daughter
and
my
wife
has
passed
from
this
life
since
when
they
had
reached
mid
atlantic
a
cablegram
one
of
those
heartbreaking
cablegrams
which
we
all
in
our
days
have
to
experience
was
put
into
my
hand
it
stated
that
that
daughter
of
ours
had
gone
to
her
long
sleep
and
so
as
i
say
i
cannot
always
be
cheerful
and
i
cannot
always
be
chaffing
i
must
sometimes
lay
the
cap
and
bells
aside
and
recognize
that
i
am
of
the
human
race
like
the
rest
and
must
have
my
cares
and
griefs
and
therefore
i
noticed
what
mr
birrell
said
i
was
so
glad
to
hear
him
say
it
something
that
was
in
the
nature
of
these
verses
here
at
the
top
of
this
he
lit
our
life
with
shafts
of
sun
and
vanquished
pain
thus
two
great
nations
stand
as
one
in
honoring
twain
i
am
very
glad
to
have
those
verses
i
am
very
glad
and
very
grateful
for
what
mr
birrell
said
in
that
connection
i
have
received
since
i
have
been
here
in
this
one
week
hundreds
of
letters
from
all
conditions
of
people
in
england
men
women
and
children
and
there
is
in
them
compliment
praise
and
above
all
and
better
than
all
there
is
in
them
a
note
of
affection
praise
is
well
compliment
is
well
but
affection
that
is
the
last
and
final
and
most
precious
reward
that
any
man
can
win
whether
by
character
or
achievement
and
i
am
very
grateful
to
have
that
reward
all
these
letters
make
me
feel
that
here
in
england
as
in
america
when
i
stand
under
the
english
flag
i
am
not
a
stranger
i
am
not
an
alien
but
at
home
dedication
speech
at
the
dedication
of
the
college
of
the
city
of
new
york
may
mr
clemens
wore
his
gown
as
doctor
of
laws
oxford
university
ambassador
bryce
and
mr
choate
had
made
the
formal
addresses
how
difficult
indeed
is
the
higher
education
mr
choate
needs
a
little
of
it
he
is
not
only
short
as
a
statistician
of
new
york
but
he
is
off
far
off
in
his
mathematics
the
four
thousand
citizens
of
greater
new
york
indeed
but
i
don't
think
it
was
wise
or
judicious
on
the
part
of
mr
choate
to
show
this
higher
education
he
has
obtained
he
sat
in
the
lap
of
that
great
education
i
was
there
at
the
time
and
see
the
result
the
lamentable
result
maybe
if
he
had
had
a
sandwich
here
to
sustain
him
the
result
would
not
have
been
so
serious
for
seventy
two
years
i
have
been
striving
to
acquire
that
higher
education
which
stands
for
modesty
and
diffidence
and
it
doesn't
work
and
then
look
at
ambassador
bryce
who
referred
to
his
alma
mater
oxford
he
might
just
as
well
have
included
me
well
i
am
a
later
production
if
i
am
the
latest
graduate
i
really
and
sincerely
hope
i
am
not
the
final
flower
of
its
seven
centuries
i
hope
it
may
go
on
for
seven
ages
longer
die
schrecken
der
deutschen
sprache
horrors
of
the
german
address
to
the
vienna
press
club
november
delivered
in
german
in
literal
it
has
me
deeply
touched
my
gentlemen
here
so
hospitably
received
to
be
from
colleagues
out
of
my
own
profession
in
this
from
my
own
home
so
far
distant
land
my
heart
is
full
of
gratitude
but
my
poverty
of
german
words
forces
me
to
greater
economy
of
expression
excuse
you
my
gentlemen
that
i
read
off
what
i
you
say
will
he
didn't
the
german
language
speak
i
not
good
but
have
numerous
connoisseurs
me
assured
that
i
her
write
like
an
angel
maybe
maybe
i
know
not
have
till
now
no
acquaintance
with
the
angels
had
that
comes
later
when
it
the
dear
god
please
it
has
no
hurry
since
long
my
gentlemen
have
i
the
passionate
longing
nursed
a
speech
on
german
to
hold
but
one
has
me
not
permitted
men
who
no
feeling
for
the
art
had
laid
me
ever
hindrance
in
the
way
and
made
naught
my
desire
sometimes
by
excuses
often
by
force
always
said
these
men
to
me
keep
you
still
your
highness
silence
for
god's
sake
seek
another
way
and
means
yourself
obnoxious
to
make
in
the
present
case
as
usual
it
is
me
difficult
become
for
me
the
permission
to
obtain
the
committee
sorrowed
deeply
but
could
me
the
permission
not
grant
on
account
of
a
law
which
from
the
concordia
demands
she
shall
the
german
language
protect
du
liebe
zeit
how
so
had
one
to
me
this
say
could
might
dared
should
i
am
indeed
the
truest
friend
of
the
german
language
and
not
only
now
but
from
long
since
yes
before
twenty
years
already
and
never
have
i
the
desire
had
the
noble
language
to
hurt
to
the
contrary
only
wished
she
to
improve
i
would
her
only
reform
it
is
the
dream
of
my
life
been
i
have
already
visits
by
the
various
german
governments
paid
and
for
contracts
prayed
i
am
now
to
austria
in
the
same
task
come
i
would
only
some
changes
effect
i
would
only
the
language
method
the
luxurious
elaborate
construction
compress
the
eternal
parenthesis
suppress
do
away
with
annihilate
the
introduction
of
more
than
thirteen
subjects
in
one
sentence
forbid
the
verb
so
far
to
the
front
pull
that
one
it
without
a
telescope
discover
can
with
one
word
my
gentlemen
i
would
your
beloved
language
simplify
so
that
my
gentlemen
when
you
her
for
prayer
need
one
her
yonder
up
understands
i
beseech
you
from
me
yourself
counsel
to
let
execute
these
mentioned
reforms
then
will
you
an
elegant
language
possess
and
afterward
when
you
some
thing
say
will
will
you
at
least
yourself
understand
what
you
said
had
but
often
nowadays
when
you
a
mile
long
sentence
from
you
given
and
you
yourself
somewhat
have
rested
then
must
you
have
a
touching
inquisitiveness
have
yourself
to
determine
what
you
actually
spoken
have
before
several
days
has
the
correspondent
of
a
local
paper
a
sentence
constructed
which
hundred
and
twelve
words
contain
and
therein
were
seven
parentheses
smuggled
in
and
the
subject
seven
times
changed
think
you
only
my
gentlemen
in
the
course
of
the
voyage
of
a
single
sentence
must
the
poor
persecuted
fatigued
subject
seven
times
change
position
now
when
we
the
mentioned
reforms
execute
will
it
no
longer
so
bad
be
doch
noch
eins
i
might
gladly
the
separable
verb
also
a
little
bit
reform
i
might
none
do
let
what
schiller
did
he
has
the
whole
history
of
the
thirty
years
war
between
the
two
members
of
a
separable
verb
in
pushed
that
has
even
germany
itself
aroused
and
one
has
schiller
the
permission
refused
the
history
of
the
hundred
years
war
to
compose
god
be
it
thanked
after
all
these
reforms
established
be
will
will
the
german
language
the
noblest
and
the
prettiest
on
the
world
be
since
to
you
now
my
gentlemen
the
character
of
my
mission
known
is
beseech
i
you
so
friendly
to
be
and
to
me
your
valuable
help
grant
mr
potzl
has
the
public
believed
make
would
that
i
to
vienna
come
am
in
order
the
bridges
to
clog
up
and
the
traffic
to
hinder
while
i
observations
gather
and
note
allow
you
yourselves
but
not
from
him
deceived
my
frequent
presence
on
the
bridges
has
an
entirely
innocent
ground
yonder
gives
it
the
necessary
space
yonder
can
one
a
noble
long
german
sentence
elaborate
the
bridge
railing
along
and
his
whole
contents
with
one
glance
overlook
on
the
one
end
of
the
railing
pasted
i
the
first
member
of
a
separable
verb
and
the
final
member
cleave
i
to
the
other
end
then
spread
the
body
of
the
sentence
between
it
out
usually
are
for
my
purposes
the
bridges
of
the
city
long
enough
when
i
but
potzl's
writings
study
will
i
ride
out
and
use
the
glorious
endless
imperial
bridge
but
this
is
a
calumny
potzl
writes
the
prettiest
german
perhaps
not
so
pliable
as
the
mine
but
in
many
details
much
better
excuse
you
these
flatteries
these
are
well
deserved
now
i
my
speech
execute
no
i
would
say
i
bring
her
to
the
close
i
am
a
foreigner
but
here
under
you
have
i
it
entirely
forgotten
and
so
again
and
yet
again
proffer
i
you
my
heartiest
thanks
german
for
the
hungarians
address
at
the
jubilee
celebration
of
the
emancipation
of
the
hungarian
press
march
the
ministry
and
members
of
parliament
were
present
the
subject
was
the
ausgleich
i
e
the
arrangement
for
the
apportionment
of
the
taxes
between
hungary
and
austria
paragraph
of
the
ausgleich
fixes
the
proportion
each
country
must
pay
to
the
support
of
the
army
it
is
the
paragraph
which
caused
the
trouble
and
prevented
its
renewal
now
that
we
are
all
here
together
i
think
it
will
be
a
good
idea
to
arrange
the
ausgleich
if
you
will
act
for
hungary
i
shall
be
quite
willing
to
act
for
austria
and
this
is
the
very
time
for
it
there
couldn't
be
a
better
for
we
are
all
feeling
friendly
fair
minded
and
hospitable
now
and
full
of
admiration
for
each
other
full
of
confidence
in
each
other
full
of
the
spirit
of
welcome
full
of
the
grace
of
forgiveness
and
the
disposition
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
let
us
not
waste
this
golden
this
beneficent
this
providential
opportunity
i
am
willing
to
make
any
concession
you
want
just
so
we
get
it
settled
i
am
not
only
willing
to
let
grain
come
in
free
i
am
willing
to
pay
the
freight
on
it
and
you
may
send
delegates
to
the
reichsrath
if
you
like
all
i
require
is
that
they
shall
be
quiet
peaceable
people
like
your
own
deputies
and
not
disturb
our
proceedings
if
you
want
the
gegenseitigengeldbeitragendenverhaltnismassigkeiten
rearranged
and
readjusted
i
am
ready
for
that
i
will
let
you
off
at
twenty
eight
per
cent
twenty
seven
even
twenty
five
if
you
insist
for
there
is
nothing
illiberal
about
me
when
i
am
out
on
a
diplomatic
debauch
now
in
return
for
these
concessions
i
am
willing
to
take
anything
in
reason
and
i
think
we
may
consider
the
business
settled
and
the
ausgleich
ausgegloschen
at
last
for
ten
solid
years
and
we
will
sign
the
papers
in
blank
and
do
it
here
and
now
well
i
am
unspeakably
glad
to
have
that
ausgleich
off
my
hands
it
has
kept
me
awake
nights
for
anderthalbjahr
but
i
never
could
settle
it
before
because
always
when
i
called
at
the
foreign
office
in
vienna
to
talk
about
it
there
wasn't
anybody
at
home
and
that
is
not
a
place
where
you
can
go
in
and
see
for
yourself
whether
it
is
a
mistake
or
not
because
the
person
who
takes
care
of
the
front
door
there
is
of
a
size
that
discourages
liberty
of
action
and
the
free
spirit
of
investigation
to
think
the
ausgleich
is
abgemacht
at
last
it
is
a
grand
and
beautiful
consummation
and
i
am
glad
i
came
the
way
i
feel
now
i
do
honestly
believe
i
would
rather
be
just
my
own
humble
self
at
this
moment

dinner
given
by
the
publishers
of
the
atlantic
monthly
to
oliver
wendell
holmes
in
honor
of
his
seventieth
birthday
august
i
would
have
travelled
a
much
greater
distance
than
i
have
come
to
witness
the
paying
of
honors
to
doctor
holmes
for
my
feeling
toward
him
has
always
been
one
of
peculiar
warmth
when
one
receives
a
letter
from
a
great
man
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
it
is
a
large
event
to
him
as
all
of
you
know
by
your
own
experience
you
never
can
receive
letters
enough
from
famous
men
afterward
to
obliterate
that
one
or
dim
the
memory
of
the
pleasant
surprise
it
was
and
the
gratification
it
gave
you
lapse
of
time
cannot
make
it
commonplace
or
cheap
well
the
first
great
man
who
ever
wrote
me
a
letter
was
our
guest
oliver
wendell
holmes
he
was
also
the
first
great
literary
man
i
ever
stole
anything
from
and
that
is
how
i
came
to
write
to
him
and
he
to
me
when
my
first
book
was
new
a
friend
of
mine
said
to
me
the
dedication
is
very
neat
yes
i
said
i
thought
it
was
my
friend
said
i
always
admired
it
even
before
i
saw
it
in
the
innocents
abroad
i
naturally
said
what
do
you
mean
where
did
you
ever
see
it
before
well
i
saw
it
first
some
years
ago
as
doctor
holmes's
dedication
to
his
songs
in
many
keys
of
course
my
first
impulse
was
to
prepare
this
man's
remains
for
burial
but
upon
reflection
i
said
i
would
reprieve
him
for
a
moment
or
two
and
give
him
a
chance
to
prove
his
assertion
if
he
could
we
stepped
into
a
book
store
and
he
did
prove
it
i
had
really
stolen
that
dedication
almost
word
for
word
i
could
not
imagine
how
this
curious
thing
had
happened
for
i
knew
one
thing
that
a
certain
amount
of
pride
always
goes
along
with
a
teaspoonful
of
brains
and
that
this
pride
protects
a
man
from
deliberately
stealing
other
people's
ideas
that
is
what
a
teaspoonful
of
brains
will
do
for
a
man
and
admirers
had
often
told
me
i
had
nearly
a
basketful
though
they
were
rather
reserved
as
to
the
size
of
the
basket
however
i
thought
the
thing
out
and
solved
the
mystery
two
years
before
i
had
been
laid
up
a
couple
of
weeks
in
the
sandwich
islands
and
had
read
and
re
read
doctor
holmes's
poems
till
my
mental
reservoir
was
filled
up
with
them
to
the
brim
the
dedication
lay
on
the
top
and
handy
so
by
and
by
i
unconsciously
stole
it
perhaps
i
unconsciously
stole
the
rest
of
the
volume
too
for
many
people
have
told
me
that
my
book
was
pretty
poetical
in
one
way
or
another
well
of
course
i
wrote
doctor
holmes
and
told
him
i
hadn't
meant
to
steal
and
he
wrote
back
and
said
in
the
kindest
way
that
it
was
all
right
and
no
harm
done
and
added
that
he
believed
we
all
unconsciously
worked
over
ideas
gathered
in
reading
and
hearing
imagining
they
were
original
with
ourselves
he
stated
a
truth
and
did
it
in
such
a
pleasant
way
and
salved
over
my
sore
spot
so
gently
and
so
healingly
that
i
was
rather
glad
i
had
committed
the
crime
for
the
sake
of
the
letter
i
afterward
called
on
him
and
told
him
to
make
perfectly
free
with
any
ideas
of
mine
that
struck
him
as
being
good
protoplasm
for
poetry
he
could
see
by
that
that
there
wasn't
anything
mean
about
me
so
we
got
along
right
from
the
start
i
have
not
met
doctor
holmes
many
times
since
and
lately
he
said
however
i
am
wandering
wildly
away
from
the
one
thing
which
i
got
on
my
feet
to
do
that
is
to
make
my
compliments
to
you
my
fellow
teachers
of
the
great
public
and
likewise
to
say
that
i
am
right
glad
to
see
that
doctor
holmes
is
still
in
his
prime
and
full
of
generous
life
and
as
age
is
not
determined
by
years
but
by
trouble
and
infirmities
of
mind
and
body
i
hope
it
may
be
a
very
long
time
yet
before
any
one
can
truthfully
say
he
is
growing
old
the
weather
address
at
the
new
england
society's
seventy
first
annual
dinner
new
york
city
the
next
toast
was
the
oldest
inhabitant
the
weather
of
new
england
who
can
lose
it
and
forget
it
who
can
have
it
and
regret
it
be
interposer
twixt
us
twain
merchant
of
venice
i
reverently
believe
that
the
maker
who
made
us
all
makes
everything
in
new
england
but
the
weather
i
don't
know
who
makes
that
but
i
think
it
must
be
raw
apprentices
in
the
weather
clerk's
factory
who
experiment
and
learn
how
in
new
england
for
board
and
clothes
and
then
are
promoted
to
make
weather
for
countries
that
require
a
good
article
and
will
take
their
custom
elsewhere
if
they
don't
get
it
there
is
a
sumptuous
variety
about
the
new
england
weather
that
compels
the
stranger's
admiration
and
regret
the
weather
is
always
doing
something
there
always
attending
strictly
to
business
always
getting
up
new
designs
and
trying
them
on
the
people
to
see
how
they
will
go
but
it
gets
through
more
business
in
spring
than
in
any
other
season
in
the
spring
i
have
counted
one
hundred
and
thirty
six
different
kinds
of
weather
inside
of
four
and
twenty
hours
it
was
i
that
made
the
fame
and
fortune
of
that
man
that
had
that
marvellous
collection
of
weather
on
exhibition
at
the
centennial
that
so
astounded
the
foreigners
he
was
going
to
travel
all
over
the
world
and
get
specimens
from
all
the
climes
i
said
don't
you
do
it
you
come
to
new
england
on
a
favorable
spring
day
i
told
him
what
we
could
do
in
the
way
of
style
variety
and
quantity
well
he
came
and
he
made
his
collection
in
four
days
as
to
variety
why
he
confessed
that
he
got
hundreds
of
kinds
of
weather
that
he
had
never
heard
of
before
and
as
to
quantity
well
after
he
had
picked
out
and
discarded
all
that
was
blemished
in
any
way
he
not
only
had
weather
enough
but
weather
to
spare
weather
to
hire
out
weather
to
sell
to
deposit
weather
to
invest
weather
to
give
to
the
poor
the
people
of
new
england
are
by
nature
patient
and
forbearing
but
there
are
some
things
which
they
will
not
stand
every
year
they
kill
a
lot
of
poets
for
writing
about
beautiful
spring
these
are
generally
casual
visitors
who
bring
their
notions
of
spring
from
somewhere
else
and
cannot
of
course
know
how
the
natives
feel
about
spring
and
so
the
first
thing
they
know
the
opportunity
to
inquire
how
they
feel
has
permanently
gone
by
old
probabilities
has
a
mighty
reputation
for
accurate
prophecy
and
thoroughly
well
deserves
it
you
take
up
the
paper
and
observe
how
crisply
and
confidently
he
checks
off
what
to
day's
weather
is
going
to
be
on
the
pacific
down
south
in
the
middle
states
in
the
wisconsin
region
see
him
sail
along
in
the
joy
and
pride
of
his
power
till
he
gets
to
new
england
and
then
see
his
tail
drop
he
doesn't
know
what
the
weather
is
going
to
be
in
new
england
well
he
mulls
over
it
and
by
and
by
he
gets
out
something
about
like
this
probably
northeast
to
southwest
winds
varying
to
the
southward
and
westward
and
eastward
and
points
between
high
and
low
barometer
swapping
around
from
place
to
place
probable
areas
of
rain
snow
hail
and
drought
succeeded
or
preceded
by
earthquakes
with
thunder
and
lightning
then
he
jots
down
his
postscript
from
his
wandering
mind
to
cover
accidents
but
it
is
possible
that
the
programme
may
be
wholly
changed
in
the
mean
time
yes
one
of
the
brightest
gems
in
the
new
england
weather
is
the
dazzling
uncertainty
of
it
there
is
only
one
thing
certain
about
it
you
are
certain
there
is
going
to
be
plenty
of
it
a
perfect
grand
review
but
you
never
can
tell
which
end
of
the
procession
is
going
to
move
first
you
fix
up
for
the
drought
you
leave
your
umbrella
in
the
house
and
sally
out
and
two
to
one
you
get
drowned
you
make
up
your
mind
that
the
earthquake
is
due
you
stand
from
under
and
take
hold
of
something
to
steady
yourself
and
the
first
thing
you
know
you
get
struck
by
lightning
these
are
great
disappointments
but
they
can't
be
helped
the
lightning
there
is
peculiar
it
is
so
convincing
that
when
it
strikes
a
thing
it
doesn't
leave
enough
of
that
thing
behind
for
you
to
tell
whether
well
you'd
think
it
was
something
valuable
and
a
congressman
had
been
there
and
the
thunder
when
the
thunder
begins
to
merely
tune
up
and
scrape
and
saw
and
key
up
the
instruments
for
the
performance
strangers
say
why
what
awful
thunder
you
have
here
but
when
the
baton
is
raised
and
the
real
concert
begins
you'll
find
that
stranger
down
in
the
cellar
with
his
head
in
the
ash
barrel
now
as
to
the
size
of
the
weather
in
new
england
lengthways
i
mean
it
is
utterly
disproportioned
to
the
size
of
that
little
country
half
the
time
when
it
is
packed
as
full
as
it
can
stick
you
will
see
that
new
england
weather
sticking
out
beyond
the
edges
and
projecting
around
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
miles
over
the
neighboring
states
she
can't
hold
a
tenth
part
of
her
weather
you
can
see
cracks
all
about
where
she
has
strained
herself
trying
to
do
it
i
could
speak
volumes
about
the
inhuman
perversity
of
the
new
england
weather
but
i
will
give
but
a
single
specimen
i
like
to
hear
rain
on
a
tin
roof
so
i
covered
part
of
my
roof
with
tin
with
an
eye
to
that
luxury
well
sir
do
you
think
it
ever
rains
on
that
tin
no
sir
skips
it
every
time
mind
in
this
speech
i
have
been
trying
merely
to
do
honor
to
the
new
england
weather
no
language
could
do
it
justice
but
after
all
there
is
at
least
one
or
two
things
about
that
weather
or
if
you
please
effects
produced
by
it
which
we
residents
would
not
like
to
part
with
if
we
hadn't
our
bewitching
autumn
foliage
we
should
still
have
to
credit
the
weather
with
one
feature
which
compensates
for
all
its
bullying
vagaries
the
ice
storm
when
a
leafless
tree
is
clothed
with
ice
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
ice
that
is
as
bright
and
clear
as
crystal
when
every
bough
and
twig
is
strung
with
ice
beads
frozen
dew
drops
and
the
whole
tree
sparkles
cold
and
white
like
the
shah
of
persia's
diamond
plume
then
the
wind
waves
the
branches
and
the
sun
comes
out
and
turns
all
those
myriads
of
beads
and
drops
to
prisms
that
glow
and
burn
and
flash
with
all
manner
of
colored
fires
which
change
and
change
again
with
inconceivable
rapidity
from
blue
to
red
from
red
to
green
and
green
to
gold
the
tree
becomes
a
spraying
fountain
a
very
explosion
of
dazzling
jewels
and
it
stands
there
the
acme
the
climax
the
supremest
possibility
in
art
or
nature
of
bewildering
intoxicating
intolerable
magnificence
one
cannot
make
the
words
too
strong
the
babies
the
babies
delivered
at
the
banquet
in
chicago
given
by
the
army
of
the
tennessee
to
their
first
commander
general
u
s
grant
november
the
fifteenth
regular
toast
was
the
babies
as
they
comfort
us
in
our
sorrows
let
us
not
forget
them
in
our
festivities
i
like
that
we
have
not
all
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
ladies
we
have
not
all
been
generals
or
poets
or
statesmen
but
when
the
toast
works
down
to
the
babies
we
stand
on
common
ground
it
is
a
shame
that
for
a
thousand
years
the
world's
banquets
have
utterly
ignored
the
baby
as
if
he
didn't
amount
to
anything
if
you
will
stop
and
think
a
minute
if
you
will
go
back
fifty
or
one
hundred
years
to
your
early
married
life
and
recontemplate
your
first
baby
you
will
remember
that
he
amounted
to
a
good
deal
and
even
something
over
you
soldiers
all
know
that
when
that
little
fellow
arrived
at
family
headquarters
you
had
to
hand
in
your
resignation
he
took
entire
command
you
became
his
lackey
his
mere
body
servant
and
you
had
to
stand
around
too
he
was
not
a
commander
who
made
allowances
for
time
distance
weather
or
anything
else
you
had
to
execute
his
order
whether
it
was
possible
or
not
and
there
was
only
one
form
of
marching
in
his
manual
of
tactics
and
that
was
the
double
quick
he
treated
you
with
every
sort
of
insolence
and
disrespect
and
the
bravest
of
you
didn't
dare
to
say
a
word
you
could
face
the
death
storm
at
donelson
and
vicksburg
and
give
back
blow
for
blow
but
when
he
clawed
your
whiskers
and
pulled
your
hair
and
twisted
your
nose
you
had
to
take
it
when
the
thunders
of
war
were
sounding
in
your
ears
you
set
your
faces
toward
the
batteries
and
advanced
with
steady
tread
but
when
he
turned
on
the
terrors
of
his
war
whoop
you
advanced
in
the
other
direction
and
mighty
glad
of
the
chance
too
when
he
called
for
soothing
syrup
did
you
venture
to
throw
out
any
side
remarks
about
certain
services
being
unbecoming
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
no
you
got
up
and
got
it
when
he
ordered
his
pap
bottle
and
it
was
not
warm
did
you
talk
back
not
you
you
went
to
work
and
warmed
it
you
even
descended
so
far
in
your
menial
office
as
to
take
a
suck
at
that
warm
insipid
stuff
yourself
to
see
if
it
was
right
three
parts
water
to
one
of
milk
a
touch
of
sugar
to
modify
the
colic
and
a
drop
of
peppermint
to
kill
those
immortal
hiccoughs
i
can
taste
that
stuff
yet
and
how
many
things
you
learned
as
you
went
along
sentimental
young
folks
still
take
stock
in
that
beautiful
old
saying
that
when
the
baby
smiles
in
his
sleep
it
is
because
the
angels
are
whispering
to
him
very
pretty
but
too
thin
simply
wind
on
the
stomach
my
friends
if
the
baby
proposed
to
take
a
walk
at
his
usual
hour
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
didn't
you
rise
up
promptly
and
remark
with
a
mental
addition
which
would
not
improve
a
sunday
school
book
much
that
that
was
the
very
thing
you
were
about
to
propose
yourself
oh
you
were
under
good
discipline
and
as
you
went
fluttering
up
and
down
the
room
in
your
undress
uniform
you
not
only
prattled
undignified
baby
talk
but
even
tuned
up
your
martial
voices
and
tried
to
sing
rock
a
by
baby
in
the
tree
top
for
instance
what
a
spectacle
for
an
army
of
the
tennessee
and
what
an
affliction
for
the
neighbors
too
for
it
is
not
everybody
within
a
mile
around
that
likes
military
music
at
three
in
the
morning
and
when
you
had
been
keeping
this
sort
of
thing
up
two
or
three
hours
and
your
little
velvet
head
intimated
that
nothing
suited
him
like
exercise
and
noise
what
did
you
do
you
simply
went
on
until
you
dropped
in
the
last
ditch
the
idea
that
a
baby
doesn't
amount
to
anything
why
one
baby
is
just
a
house
and
a
front
yard
full
by
itself
one
baby
can
furnish
more
business
than
you
and
your
whole
interior
department
can
attend
to
he
is
enterprising
irrepressible
brimful
of
lawless
activities
do
what
you
please
you
can't
make
him
stay
on
the
reservation
sufficient
unto
the
day
is
one
baby
as
long
as
you
are
in
your
right
mind
don't
you
ever
pray
for
twins
twins
amount
to
a
permanent
riot
and
there
ain't
any
real
difference
between
triplets
and
an
insurrection
yes
it
was
high
time
for
a
toast
master
to
recognize
the
importance
of
the
babies
think
what
is
in
store
for
the
present
crop
fifty
years
from
now
we
shall
all
be
dead
i
trust
and
then
this
flag
if
it
still
survive
and
let
us
hope
it
may
will
be
floating
over
a
republic
numbering
souls
according
to
the
settled
laws
of
our
increase
our
present
schooner
of
state
will
have
grown
into
a
political
leviathan
a
great
eastern
the
cradled
babies
of
to
day
will
be
on
deck
let
them
be
well
trained
for
we
are
going
to
leave
a
big
contract
on
their
hands
among
the
three
or
four
million
cradles
now
rocking
in
the
land
are
some
which
this
nation
would
preserve
for
ages
as
sacred
things
if
we
could
know
which
ones
they
are
in
one
of
these
cradles
the
unconscious
farragut
of
the
future
is
at
this
moment
teething
think
of
it
and
putting
in
a
world
of
dead
earnest
unarticulated
but
perfectly
justifiable
profanity
over
it
too
in
another
the
future
renowned
astronomer
is
blinking
at
the
shining
milky
way
with
but
a
languid
interest
poor
little
chap
and
wondering
what
has
become
of
that
other
one
they
call
the
wet
nurse
in
another
the
future
great
historian
is
lying
and
doubtless
will
continue
to
lie
until
his
earthly
mission
is
ended
in
another
the
future
president
is
busying
himself
with
no
profounder
problem
of
state
than
what
the
mischief
has
become
of
his
hair
so
early
and
in
a
mighty
array
of
other
cradles
there
are
now
some
future
office
seekers
getting
ready
to
furnish
him
occasion
to
grapple
with
that
same
old
problem
a
second
time
and
in
still
one
more
cradle
some
where
under
the
flag
the
future
illustrious
commander
in
chief
of
the
american
armies
is
so
little
burdened
with
his
approaching
grandeurs
and
responsibilities
as
to
be
giving
his
whole
strategic
mind
at
this
moment
to
trying
to
find
out
some
way
to
get
his
big
toe
into
his
mouth
an
achievement
which
meaning
no
disrespect
the
illustrious
guest
of
this
evening
turned
his
entire
attention
to
some
fifty
six
years
ago
and
if
the
child
is
but
a
prophecy
of
the
man
there
are
mighty
few
who
will
doubt
that
he
succeeded
our
children
and
great
discoveries
delivered
at
the
authors
club
new
york
our
children
yours
and
mine
they
seem
like
little
things
to
talk
about
our
children
but
little
things
often
make
up
the
sum
of
human
life
that's
a
good
sentence
i
repeat
it
little
things
often
produce
great
things
now
to
illustrate
take
sir
isaac
newton
i
presume
some
of
you
have
heard
of
mr
newton
well
once
when
sir
isaac
newton
a
mere
lad
got
over
into
the
man's
apple
orchard
i
don't
know
what
he
was
doing
there
i
didn't
come
all
the
way
from
hartford
to
q
u
e
s
t
i
o
n
mr
newton's
honesty
but
when
he
was
there
in
the
main
orchard
he
saw
an
apple
fall
and
he
was
a
t
t
racted
toward
it
and
that
led
to
the
discovery
not
of
mr
newton
but
of
the
great
law
of
attraction
and
gravitation
and
there
was
once
another
great
discoverer
i've
forgotten
his
name
and
i
don't
remember
what
he
discovered
but
i
know
it
was
something
very
important
and
i
hope
you
will
all
tell
your
children
about
it
when
you
get
home
well
when
the
great
discoverer
was
once
loafn
around
down
in
virginia
and
a
puttin
in
his
time
flirting
with
pocahontas
oh
captain
john
smith
that
was
the
man's
name
and
while
he
and
poca
were
sitting
in
mr
powhatan's
garden
he
accidentally
put
his
arm
around
her
and
picked
something
a
simple
weed
which
proved
to
be
tobacco
and
now
we
find
it
in
every
christian
family
shedding
its
civilizing
influence
broadcast
throughout
the
whole
religious
community
now
there
was
another
great
man
i
can't
think
of
his
name
either
who
used
to
loaf
around
and
watch
the
great
chandelier
in
the
cathedral
at
pisa
which
set
him
to
thinking
about
the
great
law
of
gunpowder
and
eventually
led
to
the
discovery
of
the
cotton
gin
now
i
don't
say
this
as
an
inducement
for
our
young
men
to
loaf
around
like
mr
newton
and
mr
galileo
and
captain
smith
but
they
were
once
little
babies
two
days
old
and
they
show
what
little
things
have
sometimes
accomplished
educating
theatre
goers
the
children
of
the
educational
alliance
gave
a
performance
of
the
prince
and
the
pauper
on
the
afternoon
of
april
in
the
theatre
of
the
alliance
building
in
east
broadway
the
audience
was
composed
of
nearly
one
thousand
children
of
the
neighborhood
mr
clemens
mr
howells
and
mr
daniel
frohman
were
among
the
invited
guests
i
have
not
enjoyed
a
play
so
much
so
heartily
and
so
thoroughly
since
i
played
miles
hendon
twenty
two
years
ago
i
used
to
play
in
this
piece
the
prince
and
the
pauper
with
my
children
who
twenty
two
years
ago
were
little
youngsters
one
of
my
daughters
was
the
prince
and
a
neighbor's
daughter
was
the
pauper
and
the
children
of
other
neighbors
played
other
parts
but
we
never
gave
such
a
performance
as
we
have
seen
here
to
day
it
would
have
been
beyond
us
my
late
wife
was
the
dramatist
and
stage
manager
our
coachman
was
the
stage
manager
second
in
command
we
used
to
play
it
in
this
simple
way
and
the
one
who
used
to
bring
in
the
crown
on
a
cushion
he
was
a
little
fellow
then
is
now
a
clergyman
way
up
high
six
or
seven
feet
high
and
growing
higher
all
the
time
we
played
it
well
but
not
as
well
as
you
see
it
here
for
you
see
it
done
by
practically
trained
professionals
i
was
especially
interested
in
the
scene
which
we
have
just
had
for
miles
hendon
was
my
part
i
did
it
as
well
as
a
person
could
who
never
remembered
his
part
the
children
all
knew
their
parts
they
did
not
mind
if
i
did
not
know
mine
i
could
thread
a
needle
nearly
as
well
as
the
player
did
whom
you
saw
to
day
the
words
of
my
part
i
could
supply
on
the
spot
the
words
of
the
song
that
miles
hendon
sang
here
i
did
not
catch
but
i
was
great
in
that
song
mr
clemens
hummed
a
bit
of
doggerel
that
the
reporter
made
out
as
this
there
was
a
woman
in
her
town
she
loved
her
husband
well
but
another
man
just
twice
as
well
how
is
that
demanded
mr
clemens
then
it
was
so
fresh
and
enjoyable
to
make
up
a
new
set
of
words
each
time
that
i
played
the
part
if
i
had
a
thousand
citizens
in
front
of
me
i
would
like
to
give
them
information
but
you
children
already
know
all
that
i
have
found
out
about
the
educational
alliance
it's
like
a
man
living
within
thirty
miles
of
vesuvius
and
never
knowing
about
a
volcano
it's
like
living
for
a
lifetime
in
buffalo
eighteen
miles
from
niagara
and
never
going
to
see
the
falls
so
i
had
lived
in
new
york
and
knew
nothing
about
the
educational
alliance
this
theatre
is
a
part
of
the
work
and
furnishes
pure
and
clean
plays
this
theatre
is
an
influence
everything
in
the
world
is
accomplished
by
influences
which
train
and
educate
when
you
get
to
be
seventy
one
and
a
half
as
i
am
you
may
think
that
your
education
is
over
but
it
isn't
if
we
had
forty
theatres
of
this
kind
in
this
city
of
four
millions
how
they
would
educate
and
elevate
we
should
have
a
body
of
educated
theatre
goers
it
would
make
better
citizens
honest
citizens
one
of
the
best
gifts
a
millionaire
could
make
would
be
a
theatre
here
and
a
theatre
there
it
would
make
of
you
a
real
republic
and
bring
about
an
educational
level
the
educational
theatre
on
november
mr
clemens
entertained
a
party
of
six
or
seven
hundred
of
his
friends
inviting
them
to
witness
the
representation
of
the
prince
and
the
pauper
played
by
boys
and
girls
of
the
east
side
at
the
children's
educational
theatre
new
york
just
a
word
or
two
to
let
you
know
how
deeply
i
appreciate
the
honor
which
the
children
who
are
the
actors
and
frequenters
of
this
cozy
playhouse
have
conferred
upon
me
they
have
asked
me
to
be
their
ambassador
to
invite
the
hearts
and
brains
of
new
york
to
come
down
here
and
see
the
work
they
are
doing
i
consider
it
a
grand
distinction
to
be
chosen
as
their
intermediary
between
the
children
and
myself
there
is
an
indissoluble
bond
of
friendship
i
am
proud
of
this
theatre
and
this
performance
proud
because
i
am
naturally
vain
vain
of
myself
and
proud
of
the
children
i
wish
we
could
reach
more
children
at
one
time
i
am
glad
to
see
that
the
children
of
the
east
side
have
turned
their
backs
on
the
bowery
theatres
to
come
to
see
the
pure
entertainments
presented
here
this
children's
theatre
is
a
great
educational
institution
i
hope
the
time
will
come
when
it
will
be
part
of
every
public
school
in
the
land
i
may
be
pardoned
in
being
vain
i
was
born
vain
i
guess
this
point
the
stage
manager's
whistle
interrupted
mr
clemens
that
settles
it
there's
my
cue
to
stop
i
was
to
talk
until
the
whistle
blew
but
it
blew
before
i
got
started
it
takes
me
longer
to
get
started
than
most
people
i
guess
i
was
born
at
slow
speed
my
time
is
up
and
if
you'll
keep
quiet
for
two
minutes
i'll
tell
you
something
about
miss
herts
the
woman
who
conceived
this
splendid
idea
she
is
the
originator
and
the
creator
of
this
theatre
educationally
this
institution
coins
the
gold
of
young
hearts
into
external
good
april
he
spoke
again
at
the
same
i
will
be
strictly
honest
with
you
i
am
only
fit
to
be
honorary
president
it
is
not
to
be
expected
that
i
should
be
useful
as
a
real
president
but
when
it
comes
to
things
ornamental
i
of
course
have
no
objection
there
is
of
course
no
competition
i
take
it
as
a
very
real
compliment
because
there
are
thousands
of
children
who
have
had
a
part
in
this
request
it
is
promotion
in
truth
it
is
a
thing
worth
doing
that
is
done
here
you
have
seen
the
children
play
you
saw
how
little
sally
reformed
her
burglar
she
could
reform
any
burglar
she
could
reform
me
this
is
the
only
school
in
which
can
be
taught
the
highest
and
most
difficult
lessons
morals
in
other
schools
the
way
of
teaching
morals
is
revolting
here
the
children
who
come
in
thousands
live
through
each
part
they
are
terribly
anxious
for
the
villain
to
get
his
bullet
and
that
i
take
to
be
a
humane
and
proper
sentiment
they
spend
freely
the
ten
cents
that
is
not
saved
without
a
struggle
it
comes
out
of
the
candy
money
and
the
money
that
goes
for
chewing
gum
and
other
necessaries
of
life
they
make
the
sacrifice
freely
this
is
the
only
school
which
they
are
sorry
to
leave
poets
as
policemen
mr
clemens
was
one
of
the
speakers
at
the
lotos
club
dinner
to
governor
odell
march
the
police
problem
was
referred
to
at
length
let
us
abolish
policemen
who
carry
clubs
and
revolvers
and
put
in
a
squad
of
poets
armed
to
the
teeth
with
poems
on
spring
and
love
i
would
be
very
glad
to
serve
as
commissioner
not
because
i
think
i
am
especially
qualified
but
because
i
am
too
tired
to
work
and
would
like
to
take
a
rest
howells
would
go
well
as
my
deputy
he
is
tired
too
and
needs
a
rest
badly
i
would
start
in
at
once
to
elevate
purify
and
depopulate
the
red
light
district
i
would
assign
the
most
soulful
poets
to
that
district
all
heavily
armed
with
their
poems
take
chauncey
depew
as
a
sample
i
would
station
them
on
the
corners
after
they
had
rounded
up
all
the
depraved
people
of
the
district
so
they
could
not
escape
and
then
have
them
read
from
their
poems
to
the
poor
unfortunates
the
plan
would
be
very
effective
in
causing
an
emigration
of
the
depraved
element
pudd'nhead
wilson
dramatized
when
mr
clemens
arrived
from
europe
in
one
of
the
first
things
he
did
was
to
see
the
dramatization
of
pudd'nhead
wilson
the
audience
becoming
aware
of
the
fact
that
mr
clemens
was
in
the
house
called
upon
him
for
a
speech
never
in
my
life
have
i
been
able
to
make
a
speech
without
preparation
and
i
assure
you
that
this
position
in
which
i
find
myself
is
one
totally
unexpected
i
have
been
hemmed
in
all
day
by
william
dean
howells
and
other
frivolous
persons
and
i
have
been
talking
about
everything
in
the
world
except
that
of
which
speeches
are
constructed
then
too
seven
days
on
the
water
is
not
conducive
to
speech
making
i
will
only
say
that
i
congratulate
mr
mayhew
he
has
certainly
made
a
delightful
play
out
of
my
rubbish
his
is
a
charming
gift
confidentially
i
have
always
had
an
idea
that
i
was
well
equipped
to
write
plays
but
i
have
never
encountered
a
manager
who
has
agreed
with
me
daly
theatre
address
at
a
dinner
after
the
one
hundredth
performance
of
the
taming
of
the
shrew
mr
clemens
made
the
following
speech
which
he
incorporated
afterward
in
following
the
equator
i
am
glad
to
be
here
this
is
the
hardest
theatre
in
new
york
to
get
into
even
at
the
front
door
i
never
got
in
without
hard
work
i
am
glad
we
have
got
so
far
in
at
last
two
or
three
years
ago
i
had
an
appointment
to
meet
mr
daly
on
the
stage
of
this
theatre
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
well
i
got
on
a
train
at
hartford
to
come
to
new
york
and
keep
the
appointment
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
come
to
the
back
door
of
the
theatre
on
sixth
avenue
i
did
not
believe
that
i
did
not
believe
it
could
be
on
sixth
avenue
but
that
is
what
daly's
note
said
come
to
that
door
walk
right
in
and
keep
the
appointment
it
looked
very
easy
it
looked
easy
enough
but
i
had
not
much
confidence
in
the
sixth
avenue
door
well
i
was
kind
of
bored
on
the
train
and
i
bought
some
newspapers
new
haven
newspapers
and
there
was
not
much
news
in
them
so
i
read
the
advertisements
there
was
one
advertisement
of
a
bench
show
i
had
heard
of
bench
shows
and
i
often
wondered
what
there
was
about
them
to
interest
people
i
had
seen
bench
shows
lectured
to
bench
shows
in
fact
but
i
didn't
want
to
advertise
them
or
to
brag
about
them
well
i
read
on
a
little
and
learned
that
a
bench
show
was
not
a
bench
show
but
dogs
not
benches
at
all
only
dogs
i
began
to
be
interested
and
as
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
i
read
every
bit
of
the
advertisement
and
learned
that
the
biggest
thing
in
this
show
was
a
st
bernard
dog
that
weighed
one
hundred
and
forty
five
pounds
before
i
got
to
new
york
i
was
so
interested
in
the
bench
shows
that
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
to
one
the
first
chance
i
got
down
on
sixth
avenue
near
where
that
back
door
might
be
i
began
to
take
things
leisurely
i
did
not
like
to
be
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
there
was
not
anything
in
sight
that
looked
like
a
back
door
the
nearest
approach
to
it
was
a
cigar
store
so
i
went
in
and
bought
a
cigar
not
too
expensive
but
it
cost
enough
to
pay
for
any
information
i
might
get
and
leave
the
dealer
a
fair
profit
well
i
did
not
like
to
be
too
abrupt
to
make
the
man
think
me
crazy
by
asking
him
if
that
was
the
way
to
daly's
theatre
so
i
started
gradually
to
lead
up
to
the
subject
asking
him
first
if
that
was
the
way
to
castle
garden
when
i
got
to
the
real
question
and
he
said
he
would
show
me
the
way
i
was
astonished
he
sent
me
through
a
long
hallway
and
i
found
myself
in
a
back
yard
then
i
went
through
a
long
passageway
and
into
a
little
room
and
there
before
my
eyes
was
a
big
st
bernard
dog
lying
on
a
bench
there
was
another
door
beyond
and
i
went
there
and
was
met
by
a
big
fierce
man
with
a
fur
cap
on
and
coat
off
who
remarked
phwat
do
yez
want
i
told
him
i
wanted
to
see
mr
daly
yez
can't
see
mr
daly
this
time
of
night
he
responded
i
urged
that
i
had
an
appointment
with
mr
daly
and
gave
him
my
card
which
did
not
seem
to
impress
him
much
yez
can't
get
in
and
yez
can't
shmoke
here
throw
away
that
cigar
if
yez
want
to
see
mr
daly
yez
ll
have
to
be
after
going
to
the
front
door
and
buy
a
ticket
and
then
if
yez
have
luck
and
he's
around
that
way
yez
may
see
him
i
was
getting
discouraged
but
i
had
one
resource
left
that
had
been
of
good
service
in
similar
emergencies
firmly
but
kindly
i
told
him
my
name
was
mark
twain
and
i
awaited
results
there
was
none
he
was
not
fazed
a
bit
phwere's
your
order
to
see
mr
daly
he
asked
i
handed
him
the
note
and
he
examined
it
intently
my
friend
i
remarked
you
can
read
that
better
if
you
hold
it
the
other
side
up
but
he
took
no
notice
of
the
suggestion
and
finally
asked
where's
mr
daly's
name
there
it
is
i
told
him
on
the
top
of
the
page
that's
all
right
he
said
that's
where
he
always
puts
it
but
i
don't
see
the
w
in
his
name
and
he
eyed
me
distrustfully
finally
he
asked
phwat
do
yez
want
to
see
mr
daly
for
business
business
yes
it
was
my
only
hope
phwat
kind
theatres
that
was
too
much
no
what
kind
of
shows
then
bench
shows
it
was
risky
but
i
was
desperate
bench
shows
is
it
where
the
big
man's
face
changed
and
he
began
to
look
interested
new
haven
new
haven
it
is
ah
that's
going
to
be
a
fine
show
i'm
glad
to
see
you
did
you
see
a
big
dog
in
the
other
room
yes
how
much
do
you
think
that
dog
weighs
one
hundred
and
forty
five
pounds
look
at
that
now
he's
a
good
judge
of
dogs
and
no
mistake
he
weighs
all
of
one
hundred
and
thirty
eight
sit
down
and
shmoke
go
on
and
shmoke
your
cigar
i'll
tell
mr
daly
you
are
here
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
on
the
stage
shaking
hands
with
mr
daly
and
the
big
man
standing
around
glowing
with
satisfaction
come
around
in
front
said
mr
daly
and
see
the
performance
i
will
put
you
into
my
own
box
and
as
i
moved
away
i
heard
my
honest
friend
mutter
well
he
desarves
it
the
dress
of
civilized
woman
a
large
part
of
the
daughter
of
civilization
is
her
dress
as
it
should
be
some
civilized
women
would
lose
half
their
charm
without
dress
and
some
would
lose
all
of
it
the
daughter
of
modern
civilization
dressed
at
her
utmost
best
is
a
marvel
of
exquisite
and
beautiful
art
and
expense
all
the
lands
all
the
climes
and
all
the
arts
are
laid
under
tribute
to
furnish
her
forth
her
linen
is
from
belfast
her
robe
is
from
paris
her
lace
is
from
venice
or
spain
or
france
her
feathers
are
from
the
remote
regions
of
southern
africa
her
furs
from
the
remoter
region
of
the
iceberg
and
the
aurora
her
fan
from
japan
her
diamonds
from
brazil
her
bracelets
from
california
her
pearls
from
ceylon
her
cameos
from
rome
she
has
gems
and
trinkets
from
buried
pompeii
and
others
that
graced
comely
egyptian
forms
that
have
been
dust
and
ashes
now
for
forty
centuries
her
watch
is
from
geneva
her
card
case
is
from
china
her
hair
is
from
from
i
don't
know
where
her
hair
is
from
i
never
could
find
out
that
is
her
other
hair
her
public
hair
her
sunday
hair
i
don't
mean
the
hair
she
goes
to
bed
with
and
that
reminds
me
of
a
trifle
any
time
you
want
to
you
can
glance
around
the
carpet
of
a
pullman
car
and
go
and
pick
up
a
hair
pin
but
not
to
save
your
life
can
you
get
any
woman
in
that
car
to
acknowledge
that
hair
pin
now
isn't
that
strange
but
it's
true
the
woman
who
has
never
swerved
from
cast
iron
veracity
and
fidelity
in
her
whole
life
will
when
confronted
with
this
crucial
test
deny
her
hair
pin
she
will
deny
that
hair
pin
before
a
hundred
witnesses
i
have
stupidly
got
into
more
trouble
and
more
hot
water
trying
to
hunt
up
the
owner
of
a
hair
pin
in
a
pullman
than
by
any
other
indiscretion
of
my
life
dress
reform
and
copyright
when
the
present
copyright
law
was
under
discussion
mr
clemens
appeared
before
the
committee
he
had
sent
speaker
cannon
the
following
letter
dear
uncle
joseph
please
get
me
the
thanks
of
congress
not
next
week
but
right
away
it
is
very
necessary
do
accomplish
this
for
your
affectionate
old
friend
right
away
by
persuasion
if
you
can
by
violence
if
you
must
for
it
is
imperatively
necessary
that
i
get
on
the
floor
of
the
house
for
two
or
three
hours
and
talk
to
the
members
man
by
man
in
behalf
of
support
encouragement
and
protection
of
one
of
the
nation's
most
valuable
assets
and
industries
its
literature
i
have
arguments
with
me
also
a
barrel
with
liquid
in
it
give
me
a
chance
get
me
the
thanks
of
congress
don't
wait
for
others
there
isn't
time
furnish
them
to
me
yourself
and
let
congress
ratify
later
i
have
stayed
away
and
let
congress
alone
for
seventy
one
years
and
am
entitled
to
the
thanks
congress
knows
this
perfectly
well
and
i
have
long
felt
hurt
that
this
quite
proper
and
earned
expression
of
gratitude
has
been
merely
felt
by
the
house
and
never
publicly
uttered
send
me
an
order
on
the
sergeant
at
arms
quick
when
shall
i
come
with
love
and
a
benediction
mark
twain
while
waiting
to
appear
before
the
committee
mr
clemens
talked
to
the
reporters
why
don't
you
ask
why
i
am
wearing
such
apparently
unseasonable
clothes
i'll
tell
you
i
have
found
that
when
a
man
reaches
the
advanced
age
of
seventy
one
years
as
i
have
the
continual
sight
of
dark
clothing
is
likely
to
have
a
depressing
effect
upon
him
light
colored
clothing
is
more
pleasing
to
the
eye
and
enlivens
the
spirit
now
of
course
i
cannot
compel
every
one
to
wear
such
clothing
just
for
my
especial
benefit
so
i
do
the
next
best
thing
and
wear
it
myself
of
course
before
a
man
reaches
my
years
the
fear
of
criticism
might
prevent
him
from
indulging
his
fancy
i
am
not
afraid
of
that
i
am
decidedly
for
pleasing
color
combinations
in
dress
i
like
to
see
the
women's
clothes
say
at
the
opera
what
can
be
more
depressing
than
the
sombre
black
which
custom
requires
men
to
wear
upon
state
occasions
a
group
of
men
in
evening
clothes
looks
like
a
flock
of
crows
and
is
just
about
as
inspiring
after
all
what
is
the
purpose
of
clothing
are
not
clothes
intended
primarily
to
preserve
dignity
and
also
to
afford
comfort
to
their
wearer
now
i
know
of
nothing
more
uncomfortable
than
the
present
day
clothes
of
men
the
finest
clothing
made
is
a
person's
own
skin
but
of
course
society
demands
something
more
than
this
the
best
dressed
man
i
have
ever
seen
however
was
a
native
of
the
sandwich
islands
who
attracted
my
attention
thirty
years
ago
now
when
that
man
wanted
to
don
especial
dress
to
honor
a
public
occasion
or
a
holiday
why
he
occasionally
put
on
a
pair
of
spectacles
otherwise
the
clothing
with
which
god
had
provided
him
sufficed
of
course
i
have
ideas
of
dress
reform
for
one
thing
why
not
adopt
some
of
the
women's
styles
goodness
knows
they
adopt
enough
of
ours
take
the
peek
a
boo
waist
for
instance
it
has
the
obvious
advantages
of
being
cool
and
comfortable
and
in
addition
it
is
almost
always
made
up
in
pleasing
colors
which
cheer
and
do
not
depress
it
is
true
that
i
dressed
the
connecticut
yankee
at
king
arthur's
court
in
a
plug
hat
but
let's
see
that
was
twenty
five
years
ago
then
no
man
was
considered
fully
dressed
until
he
donned
a
plug
hat
nowadays
i
think
that
no
man
is
dressed
until
he
leaves
it
home
why
when
i
left
home
yesterday
they
trotted
out
a
plug
hat
for
me
to
wear
you
must
wear
it
they
told
me
why
just
think
of
going
to
washington
without
a
plug
hat
but
i
said
no
i
would
wear
a
derby
or
nothing
why
i
believe
i
could
walk
along
the
streets
of
new
york
i
never
do
but
still
i
think
i
could
and
i
should
never
see
a
well
dressed
man
wearing
a
plug
hat
if
i
did
i
should
suspect
him
of
something
i
don't
know
just
what
but
i
would
suspect
him
why
when
i
got
up
on
the
second
story
of
that
pennsylvania
ferry
boat
coming
down
here
yesterday
i
saw
howells
coming
along
he
was
the
only
man
on
the
boat
with
a
plug
hat
and
i
tell
you
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
he
said
he
had
been
persuaded
to
wear
it
against
his
better
sense
but
just
think
of
a
man
nearly
seventy
years
old
who
has
not
a
mind
of
his
own
on
such
matters
are
you
doing
any
work
now
the
youngest
and
most
serious
reporter
asked
work
i
retired
from
work
on
my
seventieth
birthday
since
then
i
have
been
putting
in
merely
twenty
six
hours
a
day
dictating
my
autobiography
which
as
john
phoenix
said
in
regard
to
his
autograph
may
be
relied
upon
as
authentic
as
it
is
written
exclusively
by
me
but
it
is
not
to
be
published
in
full
until
i
am
thoroughly
dead
i
have
made
it
as
caustic
fiendish
and
devilish
as
possible
it
will
fill
many
volumes
and
i
shall
continue
writing
it
until
the
time
comes
for
me
to
join
the
angels
it
is
going
to
be
a
terrible
autobiography
it
will
make
the
hair
of
some
folks
curl
but
it
cannot
be
published
until
i
am
dead
and
the
persons
mentioned
in
it
and
their
children
and
grandchildren
are
dead
it
is
something
awful
can
you
tell
us
the
names
of
some
of
the
notables
that
are
here
to
see
you
off
i
don't
know
i
am
so
shy
my
shyness
takes
a
peculiar
phase
i
never
look
a
person
in
the
face
the
reason
is
that
i
am
afraid
they
may
know
me
and
that
i
may
not
know
them
which
makes
it
very
embarrassing
for
both
of
us
i
always
wait
for
the
other
person
to
speak
i
know
lots
of
people
but
i
don't
know
who
they
are
it
is
all
a
matter
of
ability
to
observe
things
i
never
observe
anything
now
i
gave
up
the
habit
years
ago
you
should
keep
a
habit
up
if
you
want
to
become
proficient
in
it
for
instance
i
was
a
pilot
once
but
i
gave
it
up
and
i
do
not
believe
the
captain
of
the
minneapolis
would
let
me
navigate
his
ship
to
london
still
if
i
think
that
he
is
not
on
the
job
i
may
go
up
on
the
bridge
and
offer
him
a
few
suggestions
college
girls
five
hundred
undergraduates
under
the
auspices
of
the
woman's
university
club
new
york
welcomed
mr
clemens
as
their
guest
april
and
gave
him
the
freedom
of
the
club
which
the
chairman
explained
was
freedom
to
talk
individually
to
any
girl
present
i've
worked
for
the
public
good
thirty
years
so
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
shall
work
for
my
personal
contentment
i
am
glad
miss
neron
has
fed
me
for
there
is
no
telling
what
iniquity
i
might
wander
into
on
an
empty
stomach
i
mean
an
empty
mind
i
am
going
to
tell
you
a
practical
story
about
how
once
upon
a
time
i
was
blind
a
story
i
should
have
been
using
all
these
months
but
i
never
thought
about
telling
it
until
the
other
night
and
now
it
is
too
late
for
on
the
nineteenth
of
this
month
i
hope
to
take
formal
leave
of
the
platform
forever
at
carnegie
hall
that
is
take
leave
so
far
as
talking
for
money
and
for
people
who
have
paid
money
to
hear
me
talk
i
shall
continue
to
infest
the
platform
on
these
conditions
that
there
is
nobody
in
the
house
who
has
paid
to
hear
me
that
i
am
not
paid
to
be
heard
and
that
there
will
be
none
but
young
women
students
in
the
audience
mr
clemens
told
the
story
of
how
he
took
a
girl
to
the
theatre
while
he
was
wearing
tight
boots
which
appears
elsewhere
in
this
volume
and
ended
by
saying
and
now
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
i
don't
know
what
kind
of
a
lesson
i'll
let
you
think
it
out
girls
in
my
capacity
of
publisher
i
recently
received
a
manuscript
from
a
teacher
which
embodied
a
number
of
answers
given
by
her
pupils
to
questions
propounded
these
answers
show
that
the
children
had
nothing
but
the
sound
to
go
by
the
sense
was
perfectly
empty
here
are
some
of
their
answers
to
words
they
were
asked
to
define
auriferous
pertaining
to
an
orifice
ammonia
the
food
of
the
gods
equestrian
one
who
asks
questions
parasite
a
kind
of
umbrella
ipecaca
man
who
likes
a
good
dinner
and
here
is
the
definition
of
an
ancient
word
honored
by
a
great
party
republican
a
sinner
mentioned
in
the
bible
and
here
is
an
innocent
deliverance
of
a
zoological
kind
there
are
a
good
many
donkeys
in
the
theological
gardens
here
also
is
a
definition
which
really
isn't
very
bad
in
its
way
demagogue
a
vessel
containing
beer
and
other
liquids
here
too
is
a
sample
of
a
boy's
composition
on
girls
which
i
must
say
i
rather
like
girls
are
very
stuckup
and
dignified
in
their
manner
and
behaveyour
they
think
more
of
dress
than
anything
and
like
to
play
with
dowls
and
rags
they
cry
if
they
see
a
cow
in
a
far
distance
and
are
afraid
of
guns
they
stay
at
home
all
the
time
and
go
to
church
every
sunday
they
are
al
ways
sick
they
are
al
ways
furry
and
making
fun
of
boys
hands
and
they
say
how
dirty
they
cant
play
marbles
i
pity
them
poor
things
they
make
fun
of
boys
and
then
turn
round
and
love
them
i
don't
belave
they
ever
kiled
a
cat
or
anything
they
look
out
every
nite
and
say
oh
a'nt
the
moon
lovely
thir
is
one
thing
i
have
not
told
and
that
is
they
al
ways
now
their
lessons
bettern
boys
the
ladies
delivered
at
the
anniversary
festival
of
the
scottish
corporation
of
london
mr
clemens
replied
to
the
toast
the
ladies
i
am
proud
indeed
of
the
distinction
of
being
chosen
to
respond
to
this
especial
toast
to
the
ladies
or
to
women
if
you
please
for
that
is
the
preferable
term
perhaps
it
is
certainly
the
older
and
therefore
the
more
entitled
to
reverence
i
have
noticed
that
the
bible
with
that
plain
blunt
honesty
which
is
such
a
conspicuous
characteristic
of
the
scriptures
is
always
particular
to
never
refer
to
even
the
illustrious
mother
of
all
mankind
as
a
lady
but
speaks
of
her
as
a
woman
it
is
odd
but
you
will
find
it
is
so
i
am
peculiarly
proud
of
this
honor
because
i
think
that
the
toast
to
women
is
one
which
by
right
and
by
every
rule
of
gallantry
should
take
precedence
of
all
others
of
the
army
of
the
navy
of
even
royalty
itself
perhaps
though
the
latter
is
not
necessary
in
this
day
and
in
this
land
for
the
reason
that
tacitly
you
do
drink
a
broad
general
health
to
all
good
women
when
you
drink
the
health
of
the
queen
of
england
and
the
princess
of
wales
i
have
in
mind
a
poem
just
now
which
is
familiar
to
you
all
familiar
to
everybody
and
what
an
inspiration
that
was
and
how
instantly
the
present
toast
recalls
the
verses
to
all
our
minds
when
the
most
noble
the
most
gracious
the
purest
and
sweetest
of
all
poets
says
woman
o
woman
er
wom
however
you
remember
the
lines
and
you
remember
how
feelingly
how
daintily
how
almost
imperceptibly
the
verses
raise
up
before
you
feature
by
feature
the
ideal
of
a
true
and
perfect
woman
and
how
as
you
contemplate
the
finished
marvel
your
homage
grows
into
worship
of
the
intellect
that
could
create
so
fair
a
thing
out
of
mere
breath
mere
words
and
you
call
to
mind
now
as
i
speak
how
the
poet
with
stern
fidelity
to
the
history
of
all
humanity
delivers
this
beautiful
child
of
his
heart
and
his
brain
over
to
the
trials
and
sorrows
that
must
come
to
all
sooner
or
later
that
abide
in
the
earth
and
how
the
pathetic
story
culminates
in
that
apostrophe
so
wild
so
regretful
so
full
of
mournful
retrospection
the
lines
run
thus
alas
alas
a
alas
alas
alas
and
so
on
i
do
not
remember
the
rest
but
taken
together
it
seems
to
me
that
poem
is
the
noblest
tribute
to
woman
that
human
genius
has
ever
brought
forth
and
i
feel
that
if
i
were
to
talk
hours
i
could
not
do
my
great
theme
completer
or
more
graceful
justice
than
i
have
now
done
in
simply
quoting
that
poet's
matchless
words
the
phases
of
the
womanly
nature
are
infinite
in
their
variety
take
any
type
of
woman
and
you
shall
find
in
it
something
to
respect
something
to
admire
something
to
love
and
you
shall
find
the
whole
joining
you
heart
and
hand
who
was
more
patriotic
than
joan
of
arc
who
was
braver
who
has
given
us
a
grander
instance
of
self
sacrificing
devotion
ah
you
remember
you
remember
well
what
a
throb
of
pain
what
a
great
tidal
wave
of
grief
swept
over
us
all
when
joan
of
arc
fell
at
waterloo
who
does
not
sorrow
for
the
loss
of
sappho
the
sweet
singer
of
israel
who
among
us
does
not
miss
the
gentle
ministrations
the
softening
influences
the
humble
piety
of
lucretia
borgia
who
can
join
in
the
heartless
libel
that
says
woman
is
extravagant
in
dress
when
he
can
look
back
and
call
to
mind
our
simple
and
lowly
mother
eve
arrayed
in
her
modification
of
the
highland
costume
sir
women
have
been
soldiers
women
have
been
painters
women
have
been
poets
as
long
as
language
lives
the
name
of
cleopatra
will
live
and
not
because
she
conquered
george
iii
but
because
she
wrote
those
divine
lines
let
dogs
delight
to
bark
and
bite
for
god
hath
made
them
so
the
story
of
the
world
is
adorned
with
the
names
of
illustrious
ones
of
our
own
sex
some
of
them
sons
of
st
andrew
too
scott
bruce
burns
the
warrior
wallace
ben
nevis
the
gifted
ben
lomond
and
the
great
new
scotchman
ben
disraeli
benjamin
disraeli
at
that
time
prime
minister
of
england
had
just
been
elected
lord
rector
of
glasgow
university
and
had
made
a
speech
which
gave
rise
to
a
world
of
out
of
the
great
plains
of
history
tower
whole
mountain
ranges
of
sublime
women
the
queen
of
sheba
josephine
semiramis
sairey
gamp
the
list
is
endless
but
i
will
not
call
the
mighty
roll
the
names
rise
up
in
your
own
memories
at
the
mere
suggestion
luminous
with
the
glory
of
deeds
that
cannot
die
hallowed
by
the
loving
worship
of
the
good
and
the
true
of
all
epochs
and
all
climes
suffice
it
for
our
pride
and
our
honor
that
we
in
our
day
have
added
to
it
such
names
as
those
of
grace
darling
and
florence
nightingale
woman
is
all
that
she
should
be
gentle
patient
longsuffering
trustful
unselfish
full
of
generous
impulses
it
is
her
blessed
mission
to
comfort
the
sorrowing
plead
for
the
erring
encourage
the
faint
of
purpose
succor
the
distressed
uplift
the
fallen
befriend
the
friendless
in
a
word
afford
the
healing
of
her
sympathies
and
a
home
in
her
heart
for
all
the
bruised
and
persecuted
children
that
knock
at
its
hospitable
door
and
when
i
say
god
bless
her
there
is
none
among
us
who
has
known
the
ennobling
affection
of
a
wife
or
the
steadfast
devotion
of
a
mother
but
in
his
heart
will
say
amen
woman's
press
club
on
october
the
new
york
woman's
press
club
gave
a
tea
in
carnegie
hall
mr
clemens
was
the
guest
of
honor
if
i
were
asked
an
opinion
i
would
call
this
an
ungrammatical
nation
there
is
no
such
thing
as
perfect
grammar
and
i
don't
always
speak
good
grammar
myself
but
i
have
been
foregathering
for
the
past
few
days
with
professors
of
american
universities
and
i've
heard
them
all
say
things
like
this
he
don't
like
to
do
it
was
a
stir
oh
you'll
hear
that
to
night
if
you
listen
or
he
would
have
liked
to
have
done
it
you'll
catch
some
educated
americans
saying
that
when
these
men
take
pen
in
hand
they
write
with
as
good
grammar
as
any
but
the
moment
they
throw
the
pen
aside
they
throw
grammatical
morals
aside
with
it
to
illustrate
the
desirability
and
possibility
of
concentration
i
must
tell
you
a
story
of
my
little
six
year
old
daughter
the
governess
had
been
teaching
her
about
the
reindeer
and
as
the
custom
was
she
related
it
to
the
family
she
reduced
the
history
of
that
reindeer
to
two
or
three
sentences
when
the
governess
could
not
have
put
it
into
a
page
she
said
the
reindeer
is
a
very
swift
animal
a
reindeer
once
drew
a
sled
four
hundred
miles
in
two
hours
she
appended
the
comment
this
was
regarded
as
extraordinary
and
concluded
when
that
reindeer
was
done
drawing
that
sled
four
hundred
miles
in
two
hours
it
died
as
a
final
instance
of
the
force
of
limitations
in
the
development
of
concentration
i
must
mention
that
beautiful
creature
helen
keller
whom
i
have
known
for
these
many
years
i
am
filled
with
the
wonder
of
her
knowledge
acquired
because
shut
out
from
all
distraction
if
i
could
have
been
deaf
dumb
and
blind
i
also
might
have
arrived
at
something
votes
for
women
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
hebrew
technical
school
for
girls
held
in
the
temple
emmanuel
january
mr
clemens
was
introduced
by
president
meyer
who
said
in
one
of
mr
clemens's
works
he
expressed
his
opinion
of
men
saying
he
had
no
choice
between
hebrew
and
gentile
black
men
or
white
to
him
all
men
were
alike
but
i
never
could
find
that
he
expressed
his
opinion
of
women
perhaps
that
opinion
was
so
exalted
that
he
could
not
express
it
we
shall
now
be
called
to
hear
what
he
thinks
of
women
ladies
and
gentlemen
it
is
a
small
help
that
i
can
afford
but
it
is
just
such
help
that
one
can
give
as
coming
from
the
heart
through
the
mouth
the
report
of
mr
meyer
was
admirable
and
i
was
as
interested
in
it
as
you
have
been
why
i'm
twice
as
old
as
he
and
i've
had
so
much
experience
that
i
would
say
to
him
when
he
makes
his
appeal
for
help
don't
make
it
for
to
day
or
to
morrow
but
collect
the
money
on
the
spot
we
are
all
creatures
of
sudden
impulse
we
must
be
worked
up
by
steam
as
it
were
get
them
to
write
their
wills
now
or
it
may
be
too
late
by
and
by
fifteen
or
twenty
years
ago
i
had
an
experience
i
shall
never
forget
i
got
into
a
church
which
was
crowded
by
a
sweltering
and
panting
multitude
the
city
missionary
of
our
town
hartford
made
a
telling
appeal
for
help
he
told
of
personal
experiences
among
the
poor
in
cellars
and
top
lofts
requiring
instances
of
devotion
and
help
the
poor
are
always
good
to
the
poor
when
a
person
with
his
millions
gives
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
it
makes
a
great
noise
in
the
world
but
he
does
not
miss
it
it's
the
widow's
mite
that
makes
no
noise
but
does
the
best
work
i
remember
on
that
occasion
in
the
hartford
church
the
collection
was
being
taken
up
the
appeal
had
so
stirred
me
that
i
could
hardly
wait
for
the
hat
or
plate
to
come
my
way
i
had
four
hundred
dollars
in
my
pocket
and
i
was
anxious
to
drop
it
in
the
plate
and
wanted
to
borrow
more
but
the
plate
was
so
long
in
coming
my
way
that
the
fever
heat
of
beneficence
was
going
down
lower
and
lower
going
down
at
the
rate
of
a
hundred
dollars
a
minute
the
plate
was
passed
too
late
when
it
finally
came
to
me
my
enthusiasm
had
gone
down
so
much
that
i
kept
my
four
hundred
dollars
and
stole
a
dime
from
the
plate
so
you
see
time
sometimes
leads
to
crime
oh
many
a
time
have
i
thought
of
that
and
regretted
it
and
i
adjure
you
all
to
give
while
the
fever
is
on
you
referring
to
woman's
sphere
in
life
i'll
say
that
woman
is
always
right
for
twenty
five
years
i've
been
a
woman's
rights
man
i
have
always
believed
long
before
my
mother
died
that
with
her
gray
hairs
and
admirable
intellect
perhaps
she
knew
as
much
as
i
did
perhaps
she
knew
as
much
about
voting
as
i
i
should
like
to
see
the
time
come
when
women
shall
help
to
make
the
laws
i
should
like
to
see
that
whip
lash
the
ballot
in
the
hands
of
women
as
for
this
city's
government
i
don't
want
to
say
much
except
that
it
is
a
shame
a
shame
but
if
i
should
live
twenty
five
years
longer
and
there
is
no
reason
why
i
shouldn't
i
think
i'll
see
women
handle
the
ballot
if
women
had
the
ballot
to
day
the
state
of
things
in
this
town
would
not
exist
if
all
the
women
in
this
town
had
a
vote
to
day
they
would
elect
a
mayor
at
the
next
election
and
they
would
rise
in
their
might
and
change
the
awful
state
of
things
now
existing
here
woman
an
opinion
address
at
an
early
banquet
of
the
washington
correspondents
club
the
twelfth
toast
was
as
follows
woman
the
pride
of
any
profession
and
the
jewel
of
ours
mr
president
i
do
not
know
why
i
should
be
singled
out
to
receive
the
greatest
distinction
of
the
evening
for
so
the
office
of
replying
to
the
toast
of
woman
has
been
regarded
in
every
age
i
do
not
know
why
i
have
received
this
distinction
unless
it
be
that
i
am
a
trifle
less
homely
than
the
other
members
of
the
club
but
be
this
as
it
may
mr
president
i
am
proud
of
the
position
and
you
could
not
have
chosen
any
one
who
would
have
accepted
it
more
gladly
or
labored
with
a
heartier
good
will
to
do
the
subject
justice
than
i
because
sir
i
love
the
sex
i
love
all
the
women
irrespective
of
age
or
color
human
intellect
cannot
estimate
what
we
owe
to
woman
sir
she
sews
on
our
buttons
she
mends
our
clothes
she
ropes
us
in
at
the
church
fairs
she
confides
in
us
she
tells
us
whatever
she
can
find
out
about
the
little
private
affairs
of
the
neighbors
she
gives
us
good
advice
and
plenty
of
it
she
soothes
our
aching
brows
she
bears
our
children
ours
as
a
general
thing
in
all
relations
of
life
sir
it
is
but
a
just
and
graceful
tribute
to
woman
to
say
of
her
that
she
is
a
brick
wheresoever
you
place
woman
sir
in
whatever
position
or
estate
she
is
an
ornament
to
the
place
she
occupies
and
a
treasure
to
the
world
mr
clemens
paused
looked
inquiringly
at
his
hearers
and
remarked
that
the
applause
should
come
in
at
this
point
it
came
in
he
resumed
his
eulogy
look
at
cleopatra
look
at
desdemona
look
at
florence
nightingale
look
at
joan
of
arc
look
at
lucretia
borgia
expressed
well
mr
clemens
scratching
his
head
suppose
we
let
lucretia
slide
look
at
joyce
heth
look
at
mother
eve
you
need
not
look
at
her
unless
you
want
to
but
mr
clemens
reflectively
after
a
eve
was
ornamental
sir
particularly
before
the
fashions
changed
i
repeat
sir
look
at
the
illustrious
names
of
history
look
at
the
widow
machree
look
at
lucy
stone
look
at
elizabeth
cady
stanton
look
at
george
francis
train
and
sir
i
say
it
with
bowed
head
and
deepest
veneration
look
at
the
mother
of
washington
she
raised
a
boy
that
could
not
tell
a
lie
could
not
tell
a
lie
but
he
never
had
any
chance
it
might
have
been
different
if
he
had
belonged
to
the
washington
newspaper
correspondents
club
i
repeat
sir
that
in
whatever
position
you
place
a
woman
she
is
an
ornament
to
society
and
a
treasure
to
the
world
as
a
sweetheart
she
has
few
equals
and
no
superiors
as
a
cousin
she
is
convenient
as
a
wealthy
grandmother
with
an
incurable
distemper
she
is
precious
as
a
wetnurse
she
has
no
equal
among
men
what
sir
would
the
people
of
the
earth
be
without
woman
they
would
be
scarce
sir
almighty
scarce
then
let
us
cherish
her
let
us
protect
her
let
us
give
her
our
support
our
encouragement
our
sympathy
ourselves
if
we
get
a
chance
but
jesting
aside
mr
president
woman
is
lovable
gracious
kind
of
heart
beautiful
worthy
of
all
respect
of
all
esteem
of
all
deference
not
any
here
will
refuse
to
drink
her
health
right
cordially
in
this
bumper
of
wine
for
each
and
every
one
has
personally
known
and
loved
and
honored
the
very
best
one
of
them
all
his
own
mother
advice
to
girls
in
a
young
girl
whom
mr
clemens
met
on
the
steamer
minnehaha
called
him
grandpa
and
he
called
her
his
granddaughter
she
was
attending
st
timothy's
school
at
catonsville
maryland
and
mr
clemens
promised
her
to
see
her
graduate
he
accordingly
made
the
journey
from
new
york
on
june
and
delivered
a
short
address
i
don't
know
what
to
tell
you
girls
to
do
mr
martin
has
told
you
everything
you
ought
to
do
and
now
i
must
give
you
some
don'ts
there
are
three
things
which
come
to
my
mind
which
i
consider
excellent
advice
first
girls
don't
smoke
that
is
don't
smoke
to
excess
i
am
seventy
three
and
a
half
years
old
and
have
been
smoking
seventy
three
of
them
but
i
never
smoke
to
excess
that
is
i
smoke
in
moderation
only
one
cigar
at
a
time
second
don't
drink
that
is
don't
drink
to
excess
third
don't
marry
i
mean
to
excess
honesty
is
the
best
policy
that
is
an
old
proverb
but
you
don't
want
ever
to
forget
it
in
your
journey
through
life
taxes
and
morals
address
delivered
in
new
york
january
at
the
twenty
fifth
anniversary
of
the
founding
of
tuskeegee
institute
by
booker
washington
mr
choate
presided
and
in
introducing
mr
clemens
made
fun
of
him
because
he
made
play
his
work
and
that
when
he
worked
hardest
he
did
so
lying
in
bed
i
came
here
in
the
responsible
capacity
of
policeman
to
watch
mr
choate
this
is
an
occasion
of
grave
and
serious
importance
and
it
seems
necessary
for
me
to
be
present
so
that
if
he
tried
to
work
off
any
statement
that
required
correction
reduction
refutation
or
exposure
there
would
be
a
tried
friend
of
the
public
to
protect
the
house
he
has
not
made
one
statement
whose
veracity
fails
to
tally
exactly
with
my
own
standard
i
have
never
seen
a
person
improve
so
this
makes
me
thankful
and
proud
of
a
country
that
can
produce
such
men
two
such
men
and
all
in
the
same
country
we
can't
be
with
you
always
we
are
passing
away
and
then
well
everything
will
have
to
stop
i
reckon
it
is
a
sad
thought
but
in
spirit
i
shall
still
be
with
you
choate
too
if
he
can
every
born
american
among
the
eighty
millions
let
his
creed
or
destitution
of
creed
be
what
it
may
is
indisputably
a
christian
to
this
degree
that
his
moral
constitution
is
christian
there
are
two
kinds
of
christian
morals
one
private
and
the
other
public
these
two
are
so
distinct
so
unrelated
that
they
are
no
more
akin
to
each
other
than
are
archangels
and
politicians
during
three
hundred
and
sixty
three
days
in
the
year
the
american
citizen
is
true
to
his
christian
private
morals
and
keeps
undefiled
the
nation's
character
at
its
best
and
highest
then
in
the
other
two
days
of
the
year
he
leaves
his
christian
private
morals
at
home
and
carries
his
christian
public
morals
to
the
tax
office
and
the
polls
and
does
the
best
he
can
to
damage
and
undo
his
whole
year's
faithful
and
righteous
work
without
a
blush
he
will
vote
for
an
unclean
boss
if
that
boss
is
his
party's
moses
without
compunction
he
will
vote
against
the
best
man
in
the
whole
land
if
he
is
on
the
other
ticket
every
year
in
a
number
of
cities
and
states
he
helps
put
corrupt
men
in
office
whereas
if
he
would
but
throw
away
his
christian
public
morals
and
carry
his
christian
private
morals
to
the
polls
he
could
promptly
purify
the
public
service
and
make
the
possession
of
office
a
high
and
honorable
distinction
once
a
year
he
lays
aside
his
christian
private
morals
and
hires
a
ferry
boat
and
piles
up
his
bonds
in
a
warehouse
in
new
jersey
for
three
days
and
gets
out
his
christian
public
morals
and
goes
to
the
tax
office
and
holds
up
his
hands
and
swears
he
wishes
he
may
never
never
if
he's
got
a
cent
in
the
world
so
help
him
the
next
day
the
list
appears
in
the
papers
a
column
and
a
quarter
of
names
in
fine
print
and
every
man
in
the
list
a
billionaire
and
member
of
a
couple
of
churches
i
know
all
those
people
i
have
friendly
social
and
criminal
relations
with
the
whole
lot
of
them
they
never
miss
a
sermon
when
they
are
so's
to
be
around
and
they
never
miss
swearing
off
day
whether
they
are
so's
to
be
around
or
not
i
used
to
be
an
honest
man
i
am
crumbling
no
i
have
crumbled
when
they
assessed
me
at
a
fortnight
ago
i
went
out
and
tried
to
borrow
the
money
and
couldn't
then
when
i
found
they
were
letting
a
whole
crop
of
millionaires
live
in
new
york
at
a
third
of
the
price
they
were
charging
me
i
was
hurt
i
was
indignant
and
said
this
is
the
last
feather
i
am
not
going
to
run
this
town
all
by
myself
in
that
moment
in
that
memorable
moment
i
began
to
crumble
in
fifteen
minutes
the
disintegration
was
complete
in
fifteen
minutes
i
had
become
just
a
mere
moral
sand
pile
and
i
lifted
up
my
hand
along
with
those
seasoned
and
experienced
deacons
and
swore
off
every
rag
of
personal
property
i've
got
in
the
world
clear
down
to
cork
leg
glass
eye
and
what
is
left
of
my
wig
those
tax
officers
were
moved
they
were
profoundly
moved
they
had
long
been
accustomed
to
seeing
hardened
old
grafters
act
like
that
and
they
could
endure
the
spectacle
but
they
were
expecting
better
things
of
me
a
chartered
professional
moralist
and
they
were
saddened
i
fell
visibly
in
their
respect
and
esteem
and
i
should
have
fallen
in
my
own
except
that
i
had
already
struck
bottom
and
there
wasn't
any
place
to
fall
to
at
tuskeegee
they
will
jump
to
misleading
conclusions
from
insufficient
evidence
along
with
doctor
parkhurst
and
they
will
deceive
the
student
with
the
superstition
that
no
gentleman
ever
swears
look
at
those
good
millionaires
aren't
they
gentlemen
well
they
swear
only
once
in
a
year
maybe
but
there's
enough
bulk
to
it
to
make
up
for
the
lost
time
and
do
they
lose
anything
by
it
no
they
don't
they
save
enough
in
three
minutes
to
support
the
family
seven
years
when
they
swear
do
we
shudder
no
unless
they
say
damn
then
we
do
it
shrivels
us
all
up
yet
we
ought
not
to
feel
so
about
it
because
we
all
swear
everybody
including
the
ladies
including
doctor
parkhurst
that
strong
and
brave
and
excellent
citizen
but
superficially
educated
for
it
is
not
the
word
that
is
the
sin
it
is
the
spirit
back
of
the
word
when
an
irritated
lady
says
oh
the
spirit
back
of
it
is
damn
and
that
is
the
way
it
is
going
to
be
recorded
against
her
it
always
makes
me
so
sorry
when
i
hear
a
lady
swear
like
that
but
if
she
says
damn
and
says
it
in
an
amiable
nice
way
it
isn't
going
to
be
recorded
at
all
the
idea
that
no
gentleman
ever
swears
is
all
wrong
he
can
swear
and
still
be
a
gentleman
if
he
does
it
in
a
nice
and
benevolent
and
affectionate
way
the
historian
john
fiske
whom
i
knew
well
and
loved
was
a
spotless
and
most
noble
and
upright
christian
gentleman
and
yet
he
swore
once
not
exactly
that
maybe
still
he
but
i
will
tell
you
about
it
one
day
when
he
was
deeply
immersed
in
his
work
his
wife
came
in
much
moved
and
profoundly
distressed
and
said
i
am
sorry
to
disturb
you
john
but
i
must
for
this
is
a
serious
matter
and
needs
to
be
attended
to
at
once
then
lamenting
she
brought
a
grave
accusation
against
their
little
son
she
said
he
has
been
saying
his
aunt
mary
is
a
fool
and
his
aunt
martha
is
a
damned
fool
mr
fiske
reflected
upon
the
matter
a
minute
then
said
oh
well
it's
about
the
distinction
i
should
make
between
them
myself
mr
washington
i
beg
you
to
convey
these
teachings
to
your
great
and
prosperous
and
most
beneficent
educational
institution
and
add
them
to
the
prodigal
mental
and
moral
riches
wherewith
you
equip
your
fortunate
proteges
for
the
struggle
of
life
tammany
and
croker
mr
clemens
made
his
debut
as
a
campaign
orator
on
october
advocating
the
election
of
seth
low
for
mayor
not
as
a
republican
but
as
a
member
of
the
acorns
which
he
described
as
a
third
party
having
no
political
affiliation
but
was
concerned
only
in
the
selection
of
the
best
candidates
and
the
best
member
great
britain
had
a
tammany
and
a
croker
a
good
while
ago
this
tammany
was
in
india
and
it
began
its
career
with
the
spread
of
the
english
dominion
after
the
battle
of
plassey
its
first
boss
was
clive
a
sufficiently
crooked
person
sometimes
but
straight
as
a
yard
stick
when
compared
with
the
corkscrew
crookedness
of
the
second
boss
warren
hastings
that
old
time
tammany
was
the
east
india
company's
government
and
had
its
headquarters
at
calcutta
ostensibly
it
consisted
of
a
great
council
of
four
persons
of
whom
one
was
the
governor
general
warren
hastings
really
it
consisted
of
one
person
warren
hastings
for
by
usurpation
he
concentrated
all
authority
in
himself
and
governed
the
country
like
an
autocrat
ostensibly
the
court
of
directors
sitting
in
london
and
representing
the
vast
interests
of
the
stockholders
was
supreme
in
authority
over
the
calcutta
great
council
whose
membership
it
appointed
and
removed
at
pleasure
whose
policies
it
dictated
and
to
whom
it
conveyed
its
will
in
the
form
of
sovereign
commands
but
whenever
it
suited
hastings
he
ignored
even
that
august
body's
authority
and
conducted
the
mighty
affairs
of
the
british
empire
in
india
to
suit
his
own
notions
at
his
mercy
was
the
daily
bread
of
every
official
every
trader
every
clerk
every
civil
servant
big
and
little
in
the
whole
huge
india
company's
machine
and
the
man
who
hazarded
his
bread
by
any
failure
of
subserviency
to
the
boss
lost
it
now
then
let
the
supreme
masters
of
british
india
the
giant
corporation
of
the
india
company
of
london
stand
for
the
voters
of
the
city
of
new
york
let
the
great
council
of
calcutta
stand
for
tammany
let
the
corrupt
and
money
grubbing
great
hive
of
serfs
which
served
under
the
indian
tammany's
rod
stand
for
new
york
tammany's
serfs
let
warren
hastings
stand
for
richard
croker
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
parallel
is
exact
and
complete
and
so
let
us
be
properly
grateful
and
thank
god
and
our
good
luck
that
we
didn't
invent
tammany
edmund
burke
regarded
by
many
as
the
greatest
orator
of
all
times
conducted
the
case
against
warren
hastings
in
that
renowned
trial
which
lasted
years
and
which
promises
to
keep
its
renown
for
centuries
to
come
i
wish
to
quote
some
of
the
things
he
said
i
wish
to
imagine
him
arraigning
mr
croker
and
tammany
before
the
voters
of
new
york
city
and
pleading
with
them
for
the
overthrow
of
that
combined
iniquity
of
the
of
november
and
will
substitute
for
my
lords
read
fellow
citizens
for
kingdom
read
city
for
parliamentary
process
read
political
campaign
for
two
houses
read
two
parties
and
so
it
reads
fellow
citizens
i
must
look
upon
it
as
an
auspicious
circumstance
to
this
cause
in
which
the
honor
of
the
city
is
involved
that
from
the
first
commencement
of
our
political
campaign
to
this
the
hour
of
solemn
trial
not
the
smallest
difference
of
opinion
has
arisen
between
the
two
parties
you
will
see
in
the
progress
of
this
cause
that
there
is
not
only
a
long
connected
systematic
series
of
misdemeanors
but
an
equally
connected
system
of
maxims
and
principles
invented
to
justify
them
upon
both
of
these
you
must
judge
it
is
not
only
the
interest
of
the
city
of
new
york
now
the
most
considerable
part
of
the
city
of
the
americans
which
is
concerned
but
the
credit
and
honor
of
the
nation
itself
will
be
decided
by
this
decision
at
a
later
meeting
of
the
acorn
club
mr
clemens
said
tammany
is
dead
and
there's
no
use
in
blackguarding
a
corpse
the
election
makes
me
think
of
a
story
of
a
man
who
was
dying
he
had
only
two
minutes
to
live
so
he
sent
for
a
clergyman
and
asked
him
where
is
the
best
place
to
go
to
he
was
undecided
about
it
so
the
minister
told
him
that
each
place
had
its
advantages
heaven
for
climate
and
hell
for
society
municipal
corruption
address
at
the
city
club
dinner
january
bishop
potter
told
how
an
alleged
representative
of
tammany
hall
asked
him
in
effect
if
he
would
cease
his
warfare
upon
the
police
department
if
a
certain
captain
and
inspector
were
dismissed
he
replied
that
he
would
never
be
satisfied
until
the
man
at
the
top
and
the
system
which
permitted
evils
in
the
police
department
were
crushed
the
bishop
has
just
spoken
of
a
condition
of
things
which
none
of
us
can
deny
and
which
ought
not
to
exist
that
is
the
lust
of
gain
a
lust
which
does
not
stop
short
of
the
penitentiary
or
the
jail
to
accomplish
its
ends
but
we
may
be
sure
of
one
thing
and
that
is
that
this
sort
of
thing
is
not
universal
if
it
were
this
country
would
not
be
you
may
put
this
down
as
a
fact
that
out
of
every
fifty
men
forty
nine
are
clean
then
why
is
it
you
may
ask
that
the
forty
nine
don't
have
things
the
way
they
want
them
i'll
tell
you
why
it
is
a
good
deal
has
been
said
here
to
night
about
what
is
to
be
accomplished
by
organization
that's
just
the
thing
it's
because
the
fiftieth
fellow
and
his
pals
are
organized
and
the
other
forty
nine
are
not
that
the
dirty
one
rubs
it
into
the
clean
fellows
every
time
you
may
say
organize
organize
organize
but
there
may
be
so
much
organization
that
it
will
interfere
with
the
work
to
be
done
the
bishop
here
had
an
experience
of
that
sort
and
told
all
about
it
down
town
the
other
night
he
was
painting
a
barn
it
was
his
own
barn
and
yet
he
was
informed
that
his
work
must
stop
he
was
a
non
union
painter
and
couldn't
continue
at
that
sort
of
job
now
all
these
conditions
of
which
you
complain
should
be
remedied
and
i
am
here
to
tell
you
just
how
to
do
it
i've
been
a
statesman
without
salary
for
many
years
and
i
have
accomplished
great
and
widespread
good
i
don't
know
that
it
has
benefited
anybody
very
much
even
if
it
was
good
but
i
do
know
that
it
hasn't
harmed
me
very
much
and
is
hasn't
made
me
any
richer
we
hold
the
balance
of
power
put
up
your
best
men
for
office
and
we
shall
support
the
better
one
with
the
election
of
the
best
man
for
mayor
would
follow
the
selection
of
the
best
man
for
police
commissioner
and
chief
of
police
my
first
lesson
in
the
craft
of
statesmanship
was
taken
at
an
early
age
fifty
one
years
ago
i
was
fourteen
years
old
and
we
had
a
society
in
the
town
i
lived
in
patterned
after
the
freemasons
or
the
ancient
order
of
united
farmers
or
some
such
thing
just
what
it
was
patterned
after
doesn't
matter
it
had
an
inside
guard
and
an
outside
guard
and
a
past
grand
warden
and
a
lot
of
such
things
so
as
to
give
dignity
to
the
organization
and
offices
to
the
members
generally
speaking
it
was
a
pretty
good
sort
of
organization
and
some
of
the
very
best
boys
in
the
village
including
but
i
mustn't
get
personal
on
an
occasion
like
this
and
the
society
would
have
got
along
pretty
well
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
there
were
a
certain
number
of
the
members
who
could
be
bought
they
got
to
be
an
infernal
nuisance
every
time
we
had
an
election
the
candidates
had
to
go
around
and
see
the
purchasable
members
the
price
per
vote
was
paid
in
doughnuts
and
it
depended
somewhat
on
the
appetites
of
the
individuals
as
to
the
price
of
the
votes
this
thing
ran
along
until
some
of
us
the
really
very
best
boys
in
the
organization
decided
that
these
corrupt
practices
must
stop
and
for
the
purpose
of
stopping
them
we
organized
a
third
party
we
had
a
name
but
we
were
never
known
by
that
name
those
who
didn't
like
us
called
us
the
anti
doughnut
party
but
we
didn't
mind
that
we
said
call
us
what
you
please
the
name
doesn't
matter
we
are
organized
for
a
principle
by
and
by
the
election
came
around
and
we
made
a
big
mistake
we
were
triumphantly
beaten
that
taught
us
a
lesson
then
and
there
we
decided
never
again
to
nominate
anybody
for
anything
we
decided
simply
to
force
the
other
two
parties
in
the
society
to
nominate
their
very
best
men
although
we
were
organized
for
a
principle
we
didn't
care
much
about
that
principles
aren't
of
much
account
anyway
except
at
election
time
after
that
you
hang
them
up
to
let
them
season
the
next
time
we
had
an
election
we
told
both
the
other
parties
that
we'd
beat
any
candidates
put
up
by
any
one
of
them
of
whom
we
didn't
approve
in
that
election
we
did
business
we
got
the
man
we
wanted
i
suppose
they
called
us
the
anti
doughnut
party
because
they
couldn't
buy
us
with
their
doughnuts
they
didn't
have
enough
of
them
most
reformers
arrive
at
their
price
sooner
or
later
and
i
suppose
we
would
have
had
our
price
but
our
opponents
weren't
offering
anything
but
doughnuts
and
those
we
spurned
now
it
seems
to
me
that
an
anti
doughnut
party
is
just
what
is
wanted
in
the
present
emergency
i
would
have
the
anti
doughnuts
felt
in
every
city
and
hamlet
and
school
district
in
this
state
and
in
the
united
states
i
was
an
anti
doughnut
in
my
boyhood
and
i'm
an
anti
doughnut
still
the
modern
designation
is
mugwump
there
used
to
be
quite
a
number
of
us
mugwumps
but
i
think
i'm
the
only
one
left
i
had
a
vote
this
fall
and
i
began
to
make
some
inquiries
as
to
what
i
had
better
do
with
it
i
don't
know
anything
about
finance
and
i
never
did
but
i
know
some
pretty
shrewd
financiers
and
they
told
me
that
mr
bryan
wasn't
safe
on
any
financial
question
i
said
to
myself
then
that
it
wouldn't
do
for
me
to
vote
for
bryan
and
i
rather
thought
i
know
now
that
mckinley
wasn't
just
right
on
this
philippine
question
and
so
i
just
didn't
vote
for
anybody
i've
got
that
vote
yet
and
i've
kept
it
clean
ready
to
deposit
at
some
other
election
it
wasn't
cast
for
any
wildcat
financial
theories
and
it
wasn't
cast
to
support
the
man
who
sends
our
boys
as
volunteers
out
into
the
philippines
to
get
shot
down
under
a
polluted
flag
municipal
government
address
at
the
annual
dinner
of
the
st
nicholas
society
new
york
december
doctor
mackay
in
his
response
to
the
toast
st
nicholas
referred
to
mr
clemens
saying
mark
twain
is
as
true
a
preacher
of
true
righteousness
as
any
bishop
priest
or
minister
of
any
church
to
day
because
he
moves
men
to
forget
their
faults
by
cheerful
well
doing
instead
of
making
them
sour
and
morbid
by
everlastingly
bending
their
attention
to
the
seamy
and
sober
side
of
life
mr
chairman
and
gentlemen
of
the
st
nicholas
society
these
are
indeed
prosperous
days
for
me
night
before
last
in
a
speech
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
of
new
york
complimented
me
for
my
contribution
to
theology
and
to
night
the
reverend
doctor
mackay
has
elected
me
to
the
ministry
i
thanked
bishop
potter
then
for
his
compliment
and
i
thank
doctor
mackay
now
for
that
promotion
i
think
that
both
have
discerned
in
me
what
i
long
ago
discerned
but
what
i
was
afraid
the
world
would
never
learn
to
recognize
in
this
absence
of
nine
years
i
find
a
great
improvement
in
the
city
of
new
york
i
am
glad
to
speak
on
that
as
a
toast
the
city
of
new
york
some
say
it
has
improved
because
i
have
been
away
others
and
i
agree
with
them
say
it
has
improved
because
i
have
come
back
we
must
judge
of
a
city
as
of
a
man
by
its
external
appearances
and
by
its
inward
character
in
externals
the
foreigner
coming
to
these
shores
is
more
impressed
at
first
by
our
sky
scrapers
they
are
new
to
him
he
has
not
done
anything
of
the
sort
since
he
built
the
tower
of
babel
the
foreigner
is
shocked
by
them
in
the
daylight
they
are
ugly
they
are
well
too
chimneyfied
and
too
snaggy
like
a
mouth
that
needs
attention
from
a
dentist
like
a
cemetery
that
is
all
monuments
and
no
gravestones
but
at
night
seen
from
the
river
where
they
are
columns
towering
against
the
sky
all
sparkling
with
light
they
are
fairylike
they
are
beauty
more
satisfactory
to
the
soul
and
more
enchanting
than
anything
that
man
has
dreamed
of
since
the
arabian
nights
we
can't
always
have
the
beautiful
aspect
of
things
let
us
make
the
most
of
our
sights
that
are
beautiful
and
let
the
others
go
when
your
foreigner
makes
disagreeable
comments
on
new
york
by
daylight
float
him
down
the
river
at
night
what
has
made
these
sky
scrapers
possible
is
the
elevator
the
cigar
box
which
the
european
calls
a
lift
needs
but
to
be
compared
with
our
elevators
to
be
appreciated
the
lift
stops
to
reflect
between
floors
that
is
all
right
in
a
hearse
but
not
in
elevators
the
american
elevator
acts
like
the
man's
patent
purge
it
worked
as
the
inventor
said
this
purge
doesn't
waste
any
time
fooling
around
it
attends
strictly
to
business
that
new
yorkers
have
the
cleanest
quickest
and
most
admirable
system
of
street
railways
in
the
world
has
been
forced
upon
you
by
the
abnormal
appreciation
you
have
of
your
hackman
we
ought
always
to
be
grateful
to
him
for
that
service
nobody
else
would
have
brought
such
a
system
into
existence
for
us
we
ought
to
build
him
a
monument
we
owe
him
one
as
much
as
we
owe
one
to
anybody
let
it
be
a
tall
one
nothing
permanent
of
course
build
it
of
plaster
say
then
gaze
at
it
and
realize
how
grateful
we
are
for
the
time
being
and
then
pull
it
down
and
throw
it
on
the
ash
heap
that's
the
way
to
honor
your
public
heroes
as
to
our
streets
i
find
them
cleaner
than
they
used
to
be
i
miss
those
dear
old
landmarks
the
symmetrical
mountain
ranges
of
dust
and
dirt
that
used
to
be
piled
up
along
the
streets
for
the
wind
and
rain
to
tear
down
at
their
pleasure
yes
new
york
is
cleaner
than
bombay
i
realize
that
i
have
been
in
bombay
that
i
now
am
in
new
york
that
it
is
not
my
duty
to
flatter
bombay
but
rather
to
flatter
new
york
compared
with
the
wretched
attempts
of
london
to
light
that
city
new
york
may
fairly
be
said
to
be
a
well
lighted
city
why
london's
attempt
at
good
lighting
is
almost
as
bad
as
london's
attempt
at
rapid
transit
there
is
just
one
good
system
of
rapid
transit
in
london
the
tube
and
that
of
course
had
been
put
in
by
americans
perhaps
after
a
while
those
americans
will
come
back
and
give
new
york
also
a
good
underground
system
perhaps
they
have
already
begun
i
have
been
so
busy
since
i
came
back
that
i
haven't
had
time
as
yet
to
go
down
cellar
but
it
is
by
the
laws
of
the
city
it
is
by
the
manners
of
the
city
it
is
by
the
ideals
of
the
city
it
is
by
the
customs
of
the
city
and
by
the
municipal
government
which
all
these
elements
correct
support
and
foster
by
which
the
foreigner
judges
the
city
it
is
by
these
that
he
realizes
that
new
york
may
indeed
hold
her
head
high
among
the
cities
of
the
world
it
is
by
these
standards
that
he
knows
whether
to
class
the
city
higher
or
lower
than
the
other
municipalities
of
the
world
gentlemen
you
have
the
best
municipal
government
in
the
world
the
purest
and
the
most
fragrant
the
very
angels
envy
you
and
wish
they
could
establish
a
government
like
it
in
heaven
you
got
it
by
a
noble
fidelity
to
civic
duty
you
got
it
by
stern
and
ever
watchful
exertion
of
the
great
powers
with
which
you
are
charged
by
the
rights
which
were
handed
down
to
you
by
your
forefathers
by
your
manly
refusal
to
let
base
men
invade
the
high
places
of
your
government
and
by
instant
retaliation
when
any
public
officer
has
insulted
you
in
the
city's
name
by
swerving
in
the
slightest
from
the
upright
and
full
performance
of
his
duty
it
is
you
who
have
made
this
city
the
envy
of
the
cities
of
the
world
god
will
bless
you
for
it
god
will
bless
you
for
it
why
when
you
approach
the
final
resting
place
the
angels
of
heaven
will
gather
at
the
gates
and
cry
out
here
they
come
show
them
to
the
archangel's
box

churchill
was
introduced
by
mr
clemens
for
years
i've
been
a
self
appointed
missionary
to
bring
about
the
union
of
america
and
the
motherland
they
ought
to
be
united
behold
america
the
refuge
of
the
oppressed
from
everywhere
who
can
pay
fifty
dollars
admission
any
one
except
a
chinaman
standing
up
for
human
rights
everywhere
even
helping
china
let
people
in
free
when
she
wants
to
collect
fifty
dollars
upon
them
and
how
unselfishly
england
has
wrought
for
the
open
door
for
all
and
how
piously
america
has
wrought
for
that
open
door
in
all
cases
where
it
was
not
her
own
yes
as
a
missionary
i've
sung
my
songs
of
praise
and
yet
i
think
that
england
sinned
when
she
got
herself
into
a
war
in
south
africa
which
she
could
have
avoided
just
as
we
sinned
in
getting
into
a
similar
war
in
the
philippines
mr
churchill
by
his
father
is
an
englishman
by
his
mother
he
is
an
american
no
doubt
a
blend
that
makes
the
perfect
man
england
and
america
yes
we
are
kin
and
now
that
we
are
also
kin
in
sin
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
desired
the
harmony
is
complete
the
blend
is
perfect

the
new

up
of
the
leading

day

a
dinner
in
honor
of
mr
and
mrs
clemens
july
it
has
always
been
difficult
leave
that
word
difficult
not
exceedingly
difficult
but
just
difficult
nothing
more
than
that
not
the
slightest
shade
to
add
to
that
just
difficult
to
respond
properly
in
the
right
phraseology
when
compliments
are
paid
to
me
but
it
is
more
than
difficult
when
the
compliments
are
paid
to
a
better
than
i
my
wife
and
while
i
am
not
here
to
testify
against
myself
i
can't
be
expected
to
do
so
a
prisoner
in
your
own
country
is
not
admitted
to
do
so
as
to
which
member
of
the
family
wrote
my
books
i
could
say
in
general
that
really
i
wrote
the
books
myself
my
wife
puts
the
facts
in
and
they
make
it
respectable
my
modesty
won't
suffer
while
compliments
are
being
paid
to
literature
and
through
literature
to
my
family
i
can't
get
enough
of
them
i
am
curiously
situated
to
night
it
so
rarely
happens
that
i
am
introduced
by
a
humorist
i
am
generally
introduced
by
a
person
of
grave
walk
and
carriage
that
makes
the
proper
background
of
gravity
for
brightness
i
am
going
to
alter
to
suit
and
haply
i
may
say
some
humorous
things
when
you
start
with
a
blaze
of
sunshine
and
upburst
of
humor
when
you
begin
with
that
the
proper
office
of
humor
is
to
reflect
to
put
you
into
that
pensive
mood
of
deep
thought
to
make
you
think
of
your
sins
if
you
wish
half
an
hour
to
fly
humor
makes
me
reflect
now
to
night
it
sets
the
thinking
machinery
in
motion
always
when
i
am
thinking
there
come
suggestions
of
what
i
am
and
what
we
all
are
and
what
we
are
coming
to
a
sermon
comes
from
my
lips
always
when
i
listen
to
a
humorous
speech
i
seize
the
opportunity
to
throw
away
frivolities
to
say
something
to
plant
the
seed
and
make
all
better
than
when
i
came
in
mr
grossmith's
remarks
there
was
a
subtle
something
suggesting
my
favorite
theory
of
the
difference
between
theoretical
morals
and
practical
morals
i
try
to
instil
practical
morals
in
the
place
of
theatrical
i
mean
theoretical
but
as
an
addendum
an
annex
something
added
to
theoretical
morals
when
your
chairman
said
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
taken
the
chair
he
did
not
mean
that
he
had
not
taken
lots
of
other
things
he
attended
my
first
lecture
and
took
notes
this
indicated
the
man's
disposition
there
was
nothing
else
flying
round
so
he
took
notes
he
would
have
taken
anything
he
could
get
i
can
bring
a
moral
to
bear
here
which
shows
the
difference
between
theoretical
morals
and
practical
morals
theoretical
morals
are
the
sort
you
get
on
your
mother's
knee
in
good
books
and
from
the
pulpit
you
gather
them
in
your
head
and
not
in
your
heart
they
are
theory
without
practice
without
the
assistance
of
practice
to
perfect
them
it
is
difficult
to
teach
a
child
to
be
honest
don't
steal
i
will
teach
you
how
it
should
be
done
lead
you
into
temptation
teach
you
how
to
steal
so
that
you
may
recognize
when
you
have
stolen
and
feel
the
proper
pangs
it
is
no
good
going
round
and
bragging
you
have
never
taken
the
chair
as
by
the
fires
of
experience
so
by
commission
of
crime
you
learn
real
morals
commit
all
the
crimes
familiarize
yourself
with
all
sins
take
them
in
rotation
there
are
only
two
or
three
thousand
of
them
stick
to
it
commit
two
or
three
every
day
and
by
and
by
you
will
be
proof
against
them
when
you
are
through
you
will
be
proof
against
all
sins
and
morally
perfect
you
will
be
vaccinated
against
every
possible
commission
of
them
this
is
the
only
way
i
will
read
you
a
written
statement
upon
the
subject
that
i
wrote
three
years
ago
to
read
to
the
sabbath
schools
the
lecturer
turned
his
pockets
out
but
without
success
no
i
have
left
it
at
home
still
it
was
a
mere
statement
of
fact
illustrating
the
value
of
practical
morals
produced
by
the
commission
of
crime
it
was
in
my
boyhood
just
a
statement
of
fact
reading
is
only
more
formal
merely
facts
merely
pathetic
facts
which
i
can
state
so
as
to
be
understood
it
relates
to
the
first
time
i
ever
stole
a
watermelon
that
is
i
think
it
was
the
first
time
anyway
it
was
right
along
there
somewhere
i
stole
it
out
of
a
farmer's
wagon
while
he
was
waiting
on
another
customer
stole
is
a
harsh
term
i
withdrew
i
retired
that
watermelon
i
carried
it
to
a
secluded
corner
of
a
lumber
yard
i
broke
it
open
it
was
green
the
greenest
watermelon
raised
in
the
valley
that
year
the
minute
i
saw
it
was
green
i
was
sorry
and
began
to
reflect
reflection
is
the
beginning
of
reform
if
you
don't
reflect
when
you
commit
a
crime
then
that
crime
is
of
no
use
it
might
just
as
well
have
been
committed
by
some
one
else
you
must
reflect
or
the
value
is
lost
you
are
not
vaccinated
against
committing
it
again
i
began
to
reflect
i
said
to
myself
what
ought
a
boy
to
do
who
has
stolen
a
green
watermelon
what
would
george
washington
do
the
father
of
his
country
the
only
american
who
could
not
tell
a
lie
what
would
he
do
there
is
only
one
right
high
noble
thing
for
any
boy
to
do
who
has
stolen
a
watermelon
of
that
class
he
must
make
restitution
he
must
restore
that
stolen
property
to
its
rightful
owner
i
said
i
would
do
it
when
i
made
that
good
resolution
i
felt
it
to
be
a
noble
uplifting
obligation
i
rose
up
spiritually
stronger
and
refreshed
i
carried
that
watermelon
back
what
was
left
of
it
and
restored
it
to
the
farmer
and
made
him
give
me
a
ripe
one
in
its
place
now
you
see
that
this
constant
impact
of
crime
upon
crime
protects
you
against
further
commission
of
crime
it
builds
you
up
a
man
can't
become
morally
perfect
by
stealing
one
or
a
thousand
green
watermelons
but
every
little
helps
i
was
at
a
great
school
yesterday
st
paul's
where
for
four
hundred
years
they
have
been
busy
with
brains
and
building
up
england
by
producing
pepys
miltons
and
marlboroughs
six
hundred
boys
left
to
nothing
in
the
world
but
theoretical
morality
i
wanted
to
become
the
professor
of
practical
morality
but
the
high
master
was
away
so
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
go
on
making
my
living
the
same
old
way
by
adding
practical
to
theoretical
morality
what
are
the
glory
that
was
greece
the
grandeur
that
was
rome
compared
to
the
glory
and
grandeur
and
majesty
of
a
perfected
morality
such
as
you
see
before
you
the
new
vagabonds
are
old
vagabonds
undergoing
the
old
sort
of
reform
you
drank
my
health
i
hope
i
have
not
been
unuseful
take
this
system
of
morality
to
your
hearts
take
it
home
to
your
neighbors
and
your
graves
and
i
hope
that
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
you
arrive
there
layman's
sermon
the
young
men's
christian
association
asked
mr
clemens
to
deliver
a
lay
sermon
at
the
majestic
theatre
new
york
march
more
than
five
thousand
young
men
tried
to
get
into
the
theatre
and
in
a
short
time
traffic
was
practically
stopped
in
the
adjacent
streets
the
police
reserves
had
to
be
called
out
to
thin
the
crowd
doctor
fagnani
had
said
something
before
about
the
police
episode
and
mr
clemens
took
it
up
i
have
been
listening
to
what
was
said
here
and
there
is
in
it
a
lesson
of
citizenship
you
created
the
police
and
you
are
responsible
for
them
one
must
pause
therefore
before
criticising
them
too
harshly
they
are
citizens
just
as
we
are
a
little
of
citizenship
ought
to
be
taught
at
the
mother's
knee
and
in
the
nursery
citizenship
is
what
makes
a
republic
monarchies
can
get
along
without
it
what
keeps
a
republic
on
its
legs
is
good
citizenship
organization
is
necessary
in
all
things
it
is
even
necessary
in
reform
i
was
an
organization
myself
once
for
twelve
hours
i
was
in
chicago
a
few
years
ago
about
to
depart
for
new
york
there
were
with
me
mr
osgood
a
publisher
and
a
stenographer
i
picked
out
a
state
room
on
a
train
the
principal
feature
of
which
was
that
it
contained
the
privilege
of
smoking
the
train
had
started
but
a
short
time
when
the
conductor
came
in
and
said
that
there
had
been
a
mistake
made
and
asked
that
we
vacate
the
apartment
i
refused
but
when
i
went
out
on
the
platform
osgood
and
the
stenographer
agreed
to
accept
a
section
they
were
too
modest
now
i
am
not
modest
i
was
born
modest
but
it
didn't
last
i
asserted
myself
insisted
upon
my
rights
and
finally
the
pullman
conductor
and
the
train
conductor
capitulated
and
i
was
left
in
possession
i
went
into
the
dining
car
the
next
morning
for
breakfast
ordinarily
i
only
care
for
coffee
and
rolls
but
this
particular
morning
i
espied
an
important
looking
man
on
the
other
side
of
the
car
eating
broiled
chicken
i
asked
for
broiled
chicken
and
i
was
told
by
the
waiter
and
later
by
the
dining
car
conductor
that
there
was
no
broiled
chicken
there
must
have
been
an
argument
for
the
pullman
conductor
came
in
and
remarked
if
he
wants
broiled
chicken
give
it
to
him
if
you
haven't
got
it
on
the
train
stop
somewhere
it
will
be
better
for
all
concerned
i
got
the
chicken
it
is
from
experiences
such
as
these
that
you
get
your
education
of
life
and
you
string
them
into
jewels
or
into
tinware
as
you
may
choose
i
have
received
recently
several
letters
asking
my
counsel
or
advice
the
principal
request
is
for
some
incident
that
may
prove
helpful
to
the
young
there
were
a
lot
of
incidents
in
my
career
to
help
me
along
sometimes
they
helped
me
along
faster
than
i
wanted
to
go
here
is
such
a
request
it
is
a
telegram
from
joplin
missouri
and
it
reads
in
what
one
of
your
works
can
we
find
the
definition
of
a
gentleman
i
have
not
answered
that
telegram
either
i
couldn't
it
seems
to
me
that
if
any
man
has
just
merciful
and
kindly
instincts
he
would
be
a
gentleman
for
he
would
need
nothing
else
in
the
world
i
received
the
other
day
a
letter
from
my
old
friend
william
dean
howells
howells
the
head
of
american
literature
no
one
is
able
to
stand
with
him
he
is
an
old
old
friend
of
mine
and
he
writes
me
to
morrow
i
shall
be
sixty
nine
years
old
why
i
am
surprised
at
howells
writing
that
i
have
known
him
longer
than
that
i'm
sorry
to
see
a
man
trying
to
appear
so
young
let's
see
howells
says
now
i
see
you
have
been
burying
patrick
i
suppose
he
was
old
too
no
he
was
never
old
patrick
he
came
to
us
thirty
six
years
ago
he
was
my
coachman
on
the
morning
that
i
drove
my
young
bride
to
our
new
home
he
was
a
young
irishman
slender
tall
lithe
honest
truthful
and
he
never
changed
in
all
his
life
he
really
was
with
us
but
twenty
five
years
for
he
did
not
go
with
us
to
europe
but
he
never
regarded
that
as
separation
as
the
children
grew
up
he
was
their
guide
he
was
all
honor
honesty
and
affection
he
was
with
us
in
new
hampshire
with
us
last
summer
and
his
hair
was
just
as
black
his
eyes
were
just
as
blue
his
form
just
as
straight
and
his
heart
just
as
good
as
on
the
day
we
first
met
in
all
the
long
years
patrick
never
made
a
mistake
he
never
needed
an
order
he
never
received
a
command
he
knew
i
have
been
asked
for
my
idea
of
an
ideal
gentleman
and
i
give
it
to
you
patrick
mcaleer
university
settlement
society
after
the
serious
addresses
were
made
seth
low
introduced
mr
clemens
at
the
settlement
house
february
the
older
we
grow
the
greater
becomes
our
wonder
at
how
much
ignorance
one
can
contain
without
bursting
one's
clothes
ten
days
ago
i
did
not
know
anything
about
the
university
settlement
except
what
i'd
read
in
the
pamphlets
sent
me
now
after
being
here
and
hearing
mrs
hewitt
and
mrs
thomas
it
seems
to
me
i
know
of
nothing
like
it
at
all
it's
a
charity
that
carries
no
humiliation
with
it
marvellous
it
is
to
think
of
schools
where
you
don't
have
to
drive
the
children
in
but
drive
them
out
it
was
not
so
in
my
day
down
stairs
just
now
i
saw
a
dancing
lesson
going
on
you
must
pay
a
cent
for
a
lesson
you
can't
get
it
for
nothing
that's
the
reason
i
never
learned
to
dance
but
it
was
the
pawnbroker's
shop
you
have
here
that
interested
me
mightily
i've
known
something
about
pawnbrokers
shops
in
my
time
but
here
you
have
a
wonderful
plan
the
ordinary
pawnbroker
charges
thirty
six
per
cent
a
year
for
a
loan
and
i've
paid
more
myself
but
here
a
man
or
woman
in
distress
can
obtain
a
loan
for
one
per
cent
a
month
it's
wonderful
i've
been
interested
in
all
i've
heard
to
day
especially
in
the
romances
recounted
by
mrs
thomas
which
reminds
me
that
i
have
a
romance
of
my
own
in
my
autobiography
which
i
am
building
for
the
instruction
of
the
world
in
san
francisco
many
years
ago
when
i
was
a
newspaper
reporter
perhaps
i
should
say
i
had
been
and
was
willing
to
be
a
pawnbroker
was
taking
care
of
what
property
i
had
there
was
a
friend
of
mine
a
poet
out
of
a
job
and
he
was
having
a
hard
time
of
it
too
there
was
passage
in
it
but
i
guess
i've
got
to
keep
that
for
the
autobiography
well
my
friend
the
poet
thought
his
life
was
a
failure
and
i
told
him
i
thought
it
was
and
then
he
said
he
thought
he
ought
to
commit
suicide
and
i
said
all
right
which
was
disinterested
advice
to
a
friend
in
trouble
but
like
all
such
advice
there
was
just
a
little
bit
of
self
interest
back
of
it
for
if
i
could
get
a
scoop
on
the
other
newspapers
i
could
get
a
job
the
poet
could
be
spared
and
so
largely
for
his
own
good
and
partly
for
mine
i
kept
the
thing
in
his
mind
which
was
necessary
as
would
be
suicides
are
very
changeable
and
hard
to
hold
to
their
purpose
he
had
a
preference
for
a
pistol
which
was
an
extravagance
for
we
hadn't
enough
between
us
to
hire
a
pistol
a
fork
would
have
been
easier
and
so
he
concluded
to
drown
himself
and
i
said
it
was
an
excellent
idea
the
only
trouble
being
that
he
was
so
good
a
swimmer
so
we
went
down
to
the
beach
i
went
along
to
see
that
the
thing
was
done
right
then
something
most
romantic
happened
there
came
in
on
the
sea
something
that
had
been
on
its
way
for
three
years
it
rolled
in
across
the
broad
pacific
with
a
message
that
was
full
of
meaning
to
that
poor
poet
and
cast
itself
at
his
feet
it
was
a
life
preserver
this
was
a
complication
and
then
i
had
an
idea
he
never
had
any
especially
when
he
was
going
to
write
poetry
i
suggested
that
we
pawn
the
life
preserver
and
get
a
revolver
the
pawnbroker
gave
us
an
old
derringer
with
a
bullet
as
big
as
a
hickory
nut
when
he
heard
that
it
was
only
a
poet
that
was
going
to
kill
himself
he
did
not
quibble
well
we
succeeded
in
sending
a
bullet
right
through
his
head
it
was
a
terrible
moment
when
he
placed
that
pistol
against
his
forehead
and
stood
for
an
instant
i
said
oh
pull
the
trigger
and
he
did
and
cleaned
out
all
the
gray
matter
in
his
brains
it
carried
the
poetic
faculty
away
and
now
he's
a
useful
member
of
society
now
therefore
i
realize
that
there's
no
more
beneficent
institution
than
this
penny
fund
of
yours
and
i
want
all
the
poets
to
know
this
i
did
think
about
writing
you
a
check
but
now
i
think
i'll
send
you
a
few
copies
of
what
one
of
your
little
members
called
strawberry
finn
public
education
association
address
at
a
meeting
of
the
berkeley
lyceum
new
york
november
i
don't
suppose
that
i
am
called
here
as
an
expert
on
education
for
that
would
show
a
lack
of
foresight
on
your
part
and
a
deliberate
intention
to
remind
me
of
my
shortcomings
as
i
sat
here
looking
around
for
an
idea
it
struck
me
that
i
was
called
for
two
reasons
one
was
to
do
good
to
me
a
poor
unfortunate
traveller
on
the
world's
wide
ocean
by
giving
me
a
knowledge
of
the
nature
and
scope
of
your
society
and
letting
me
know
that
others
beside
myself
have
been
of
some
use
in
the
world
the
other
reason
that
i
can
see
is
that
you
have
called
me
to
show
by
way
of
contrast
what
education
can
accomplish
if
administered
in
the
right
sort
of
doses
your
worthy
president
said
that
the
school
pictures
which
have
received
the
admiration
of
the
world
at
the
paris
exposition
have
been
sent
to
russia
and
this
was
a
compliment
from
that
government
which
is
very
surprising
to
me
why
it
is
only
an
hour
since
i
read
a
cablegram
in
the
newspapers
beginning
russia
proposes
to
retrench
i
was
not
expecting
such
a
thunderbolt
and
i
thought
what
a
happy
thing
it
will
be
for
russians
when
the
retrenchment
will
bring
home
the
thirty
thousand
russian
troops
now
in
manchuria
to
live
in
peaceful
pursuits
i
thought
this
was
what
germany
should
do
also
without
delay
and
that
france
and
all
the
other
nations
in
china
should
follow
suit
why
should
not
china
be
free
from
the
foreigners
who
are
only
making
trouble
on
her
soil
if
they
would
only
all
go
home
what
a
pleasant
place
china
would
be
for
the
chinese
we
do
not
allow
chinamen
to
come
here
and
i
say
in
all
seriousness
that
it
would
be
a
graceful
thing
to
let
china
decide
who
shall
go
there
china
never
wanted
foreigners
any
more
than
foreigners
wanted
chinamen
and
on
this
question
i
am
with
the
boxers
every
time
the
boxer
is
a
patriot
he
loves
his
country
better
than
he
does
the
countries
of
other
people
i
wish
him
success
the
boxer
believes
in
driving
us
out
of
his
country
i
am
a
boxer
too
for
i
believe
in
driving
him
out
of
our
country
when
i
read
the
russian
despatch
further
my
dream
of
world
peace
vanished
it
said
that
the
vast
expense
of
maintaining
the
army
had
made
it
necessary
to
retrench
and
so
the
government
had
decided
that
to
support
the
army
it
would
be
necessary
to
withdraw
the
appropriation
from
the
public
schools
this
is
a
monstrous
idea
to
us
we
believe
that
out
of
the
public
school
grows
the
greatness
of
a
nation
it
is
curious
to
reflect
how
history
repeats
itself
the
world
over
why
i
remember
the
same
thing
was
done
when
i
was
a
boy
on
the
mississippi
river
there
was
a
proposition
in
a
township
there
to
discontinue
public
schools
because
they
were
too
expensive
an
old
farmer
spoke
up
and
said
if
they
stopped
the
schools
they
would
not
save
anything
because
every
time
a
school
was
closed
a
jail
had
to
be
built
it's
like
feeding
a
dog
on
his
own
tail
he'll
never
get
fat
i
believe
it
is
better
to
support
schools
than
jails
the
work
of
your
association
is
better
and
shows
more
wisdom
than
the
czar
of
russia
and
all
his
people
this
is
not
much
of
a
compliment
but
it's
the
best
i've
got
in
stock
education
and
citizenship
on
the
evening
of
may
the
alumni
of
the
college
of
the
city
of
new
york
celebrated
the
opening
of
the
new
college
buildings
at
a
banquet
in
the
waldorf
astoria
mr
clemens
followed
mayor
mcclellan
i
agreed
when
the
mayor
said
that
there
was
not
a
man
within
hearing
who
did
not
agree
that
citizenship
should
be
placed
above
everything
else
even
learning
have
you
ever
thought
about
this
is
there
a
college
in
the
whole
country
where
there
is
a
chair
of
good
citizenship
there
is
a
kind
of
bad
citizenship
which
is
taught
in
the
schools
but
no
real
good
citizenship
taught
there
are
some
which
teach
insane
citizenship
bastard
citizenship
but
that
is
all
patriotism
yes
but
patriotism
is
usually
the
refuge
of
the
scoundrel
he
is
the
man
who
talks
the
loudest
you
can
begin
that
chair
of
citizenship
in
the
college
of
the
city
of
new
york
you
can
place
it
above
mathematics
and
literature
and
that
is
where
it
belongs
we
used
to
trust
in
god
i
think
it
was
in
that
some
genius
suggested
that
it
be
put
upon
the
gold
and
silver
coins
which
circulated
among
the
rich
they
didn't
put
it
on
the
nickels
and
coppers
because
they
didn't
think
the
poor
folks
had
any
trust
in
god
good
citizenship
would
teach
accuracy
of
thinking
and
accuracy
of
statement
now
that
motto
on
the
coin
is
an
overstatement
those
congressmen
had
no
right
to
commit
this
whole
country
to
a
theological
doctrine
but
since
they
did
congress
ought
to
state
what
our
creed
should
be
there
was
never
a
nation
in
the
world
that
put
its
whole
trust
in
god
it
is
a
statement
made
on
insufficient
evidence
leaving
out
the
gamblers
the
burglars
and
the
plumbers
perhaps
we
do
put
our
trust
in
god
after
a
fashion
but
after
all
it
is
an
overstatement
if
the
cholera
or
black
plague
should
come
to
these
shores
perhaps
the
bulk
of
the
nation
would
pray
to
be
delivered
from
it
but
the
rest
would
put
their
trust
in
the
health
board
of
the
city
of
new
york
i
read
in
the
papers
within
the
last
day
or
two
of
a
poor
young
girl
who
they
said
was
a
leper
did
the
people
in
that
populous
section
of
the
country
where
she
was
did
they
put
their
trust
in
god
the
girl
was
afflicted
with
the
leprosy
a
disease
which
cannot
be
communicated
from
one
person
to
another
yet
instead
of
putting
their
trust
in
god
they
harried
that
poor
creature
shelterless
and
friendless
from
place
to
place
exactly
as
they
did
in
the
middle
ages
when
they
made
lepers
wear
bells
so
that
people
could
be
warned
of
their
approach
and
avoid
them
perhaps
those
people
in
the
middle
ages
thought
they
were
putting
their
trust
in
god
the
president
ordered
the
removal
of
that
motto
from
the
coin
and
i
thought
that
it
was
well
i
thought
that
overstatement
should
not
stay
there
but
i
think
it
would
better
read
within
certain
judicious
limitations
we
trust
in
god
and
if
there
isn't
enough
room
on
the
coin
for
this
why
enlarge
the
coin
now
i
want
to
tell
a
story
about
jumping
at
conclusions
it
was
told
to
me
by
bram
stoker
and
it
concerns
a
christening
there
was
a
little
clergyman
who
was
prone
to
jump
at
conclusions
sometimes
one
day
he
was
invited
to
officiate
at
a
christening
he
went
there
sat
the
relatives
intelligent
looking
relatives
they
were
the
little
clergyman's
instinct
came
to
him
to
make
a
great
speech
he
was
given
to
flights
of
oratory
that
way
a
very
dangerous
thing
for
often
the
wings
which
take
one
into
clouds
of
oratorical
enthusiasm
are
wax
and
melt
up
there
and
down
you
come
but
the
little
clergyman
couldn't
resist
he
took
the
child
in
his
arms
and
holding
it
looked
at
it
a
moment
it
wasn't
much
of
a
child
it
was
little
like
a
sweet
potato
then
the
little
clergyman
waited
impressively
and
then
i
see
in
your
countenances
he
said
disappointment
of
him
i
see
you
are
disappointed
with
this
baby
why
because
he
is
so
little
my
friends
if
you
had
but
the
power
of
looking
into
the
future
you
might
see
that
great
things
may
come
of
little
things
there
is
the
great
ocean
holding
the
navies
of
the
world
which
comes
from
little
drops
of
water
no
larger
than
a
woman's
tears
there
are
the
great
constellations
in
the
sky
made
up
of
little
bits
of
stars
oh
if
you
could
consider
his
future
you
might
see
that
he
might
become
the
greatest
poet
of
the
universe
the
greatest
warrior
the
world
has
ever
known
greater
than
caesar
than
hannibal
than
er
er
turning
to
the
father
what's
his
name
the
father
hesitated
then
whispered
back
his
name
well
his
name
is
mary
ann
courage
at
a
beefsteak
dinner
given
by
artists
caricaturists
and
humorists
of
new
york
city
april
mr
clemens
mr
h
h
rogers
and
mr
patrick
mccarren
were
the
guests
of
honor
each
wore
a
white
apron
and
each
made
a
short
speech
in
the
matter
of
courage
we
all
have
our
limits
there
never
was
a
hero
who
did
not
have
his
bounds
i
suppose
it
may
be
said
of
nelson
and
all
the
others
whose
courage
has
been
advertised
that
there
came
times
in
their
lives
when
their
bravery
knew
it
had
come
to
its
limit
i
have
found
mine
a
good
many
times
sometimes
this
was
expected
often
it
was
unexpected
i
know
a
man
who
is
not
afraid
to
sleep
with
a
rattlesnake
but
you
could
not
get
him
to
sleep
with
a
safety
razor
i
never
had
the
courage
to
talk
across
a
long
narrow
room
i
should
be
at
the
end
of
the
room
facing
all
the
audience
if
i
attempt
to
talk
across
a
room
i
find
myself
turning
this
way
and
that
and
thus
at
alternate
periods
i
have
part
of
the
audience
behind
me
you
ought
never
to
have
any
part
of
the
audience
behind
you
you
never
can
tell
what
they
are
going
to
do
i'll
sit
down
the
dinner
to
mr
choate
at
a
dinner
given
in
honor
of
ambassador
joseph
h
choate
at
the
lotos
club
november
the
speakers
among
others
were
senator
depew
william
henry
white
speaker
thomas
reed
and
mr
choate
mr
clemens
spoke
in
part
as
follows
the
greatness
of
this
country
rests
on
two
anecdotes
the
first
one
is
that
of
washington
and
his
hatchet
representing
the
foundation
of
true
speaking
which
is
the
characteristic
of
our
people
the
second
one
is
an
old
one
and
i've
been
waiting
to
hear
it
to
night
but
as
nobody
has
told
it
yet
i
will
tell
it
you've
heard
it
before
and
you'll
hear
it
many
many
times
more
it
is
an
anecdote
of
our
guest
of
the
time
when
he
was
engaged
as
a
young
man
with
a
gentle
hebrew
in
the
process
of
skinning
the
client
the
main
part
in
that
business
is
the
collection
of
the
bill
for
services
in
skinning
the
man
services
is
the
term
used
in
that
craft
for
the
operation
of
that
kind
diplomatic
in
its
nature
choate's
co
respondent
made
out
a
bill
for
for
his
services
so
called
but
choate
told
him
he
had
better
leave
the
matter
to
him
and
the
next
day
he
collected
the
bill
for
the
services
and
handed
the
hebrew
saying
that's
your
half
of
the
loot
and
inducing
that
memorable
response
almost
thou
persuadest
me
to
be
a
christian
the
deep
thinkers
didn't
merely
laugh
when
that
happened
they
stopped
to
think
and
said
there's
a
rising
man
he
must
be
rescued
from
the
law
and
consecrated
to
diplomacy
the
commercial
advantages
of
a
great
nation
lie
there
in
that
man's
keeping
we
no
longer
require
a
man
to
take
care
of
our
moral
character
before
the
world
washington
and
his
anecdote
have
done
that
we
require
a
man
to
take
care
of
our
commercial
prosperity
mr
choate
has
carried
that
trait
with
him
and
as
mr
carnegie
has
said
he
has
worked
like
a
mole
underground
we
see
the
result
when
american
railroad
iron
is
sold
so
cheap
in
england
that
the
poorest
family
can
have
it
he
has
so
beguiled
that
cabinet
of
england
he
has
been
spreading
the
commerce
of
this
nation
and
has
depressed
english
commerce
in
the
same
ratio
this
was
the
principle
underlying
that
anecdote
and
the
wise
men
saw
it
the
principle
of
give
and
take
give
one
and
take
ten
the
principle
of
diplomacy
on
stanley
and
livingstone
mr
clemens
was
entertained
at
dinner
by
the
whitefriars
club
london
at
the
mitre
tavern
on
the
evening
of
august
in
reply
to
the
toast
in
his
honor
he
said
gentlemen
i
thank
you
very
heartily
indeed
for
this
expression
of
kindness
toward
me
what
i
have
done
for
england
and
civilization
in
the
arduous
affairs
which
i
have
engaged
in
that
is
good
that
is
so
smooth
that
i
will
say
it
again
and
again
what
i
have
done
for
england
and
civilization
in
the
arduous
part
i
have
performed
i
have
done
with
a
single
hearted
devotion
and
with
no
hope
of
reward
i
am
proud
i
am
very
proud
that
it
was
reserved
for
me
to
find
doctor
livingstone
and
for
mr
stanley
to
get
all
the
credit
i
hunted
for
that
man
in
africa
all
over
seventy
five
or
one
hundred
parishes
thousands
and
thousands
of
miles
in
the
wilds
and
deserts
all
over
the
place
sometimes
riding
negroes
and
sometimes
travelling
by
rail
i
didn't
mind
the
rail
or
anything
else
so
that
i
didn't
come
in
for
the
tar
and
feathers
i
found
that
man
at
ujiji
a
place
you
may
remember
if
you
have
ever
been
there
and
it
was
a
very
great
satisfaction
that
i
found
him
just
in
the
nick
of
time
i
found
that
poor
old
man
deserted
by
his
niggers
and
by
his
geographers
deserted
by
all
of
his
kind
except
the
gorillas
dejected
miserable
famishing
absolutely
famishing
but
he
was
eloquent
just
as
i
found
him
he
had
eaten
his
last
elephant
and
he
said
to
me
god
knows
where
i
shall
get
another
he
had
nothing
to
wear
except
his
venerable
and
honorable
naval
suit
and
nothing
to
eat
but
his
diary
but
i
said
to
him
it
is
all
right
i
have
discovered
you
and
stanley
will
be
here
by
the
four
o'clock
train
and
will
discover
you
officially
and
then
we
will
turn
to
and
have
a
reg'lar
good
time
i
said
cheer
up
for
stanley
has
got
corn
ammunition
glass
beads
hymn
books
whiskey
and
everything
which
the
human
heart
can
desire
he
has
got
all
kinds
of
valuables
including
telegraph
poles
and
a
few
cart
loads
of
money
by
this
time
communication
has
been
made
with
the
land
of
bibles
and
civilization
and
property
will
advance
and
then
we
surveyed
all
that
country
from
ujiji
through
unanogo
and
other
places
to
unyanyembe
i
mention
these
names
simply
for
your
edification
nothing
more
do
not
expect
it
particularly
as
intelligence
to
the
royal
geographical
society
and
then
having
filled
up
the
old
man
we
were
all
too
full
for
utterance
and
departed
we
have
since
then
feasted
on
honors
stanley
has
received
a
snuff
box
and
i
have
received
considerable
snuff
he
has
got
to
write
a
book
and
gather
in
the
rest
of
the
credit
and
i
am
going
to
levy
on
the
copyright
and
to
collect
the
money
nothing
comes
amiss
to
me
cash
or
credit
but
seriously
i
do
feel
that
stanley
is
the
chief
man
and
an
illustrious
one
and
i
do
applaud
him
with
all
my
heart
whether
he
is
an
american
or
a
welshman
by
birth
or
one
or
both
matters
not
to
me
so
far
as
i
am
personally
concerned
i
am
simply
here
to
stay
a
few
months
and
to
see
english
people
and
to
learn
english
manners
and
customs
and
to
enjoy
myself
so
the
simplest
thing
i
can
do
is
to
thank
you
for
the
toast
you
have
honored
me
with
and
for
the
remarks
you
have
made
and
to
wish
health
and
prosperity
to
the
whitefriars
club
and
to
sink
down
to
my
accustomed
level
henry
m
stanley
address
delivered
in
boston
november
mr
clemens
introduced
mr
stanley
ladies
and
gentlemen
if
any
should
ask
why
is
it
that
you
are
here
as
introducer
of
the
lecturer
i
should
answer
that
i
happened
to
be
around
and
was
asked
to
perform
this
function
i
was
quite
willing
to
do
so
and
as
there
was
no
sort
of
need
of
an
introduction
anyway
it
could
be
necessary
only
that
some
person
come
forward
for
a
moment
and
do
an
unnecessary
thing
and
this
is
quite
in
my
line
now
to
introduce
so
illustrious
a
name
as
henry
m
stanley
by
any
detail
of
what
the
man
has
done
is
clear
aside
from
my
purpose
that
would
be
stretching
the
unnecessary
to
an
unconscionable
degree
when
i
contrast
what
i
have
achieved
in
my
measurably
brief
life
with
what
he
has
achieved
in
his
possibly
briefer
one
the
effect
is
to
sweep
utterly
away
the
ten
story
edifice
of
my
own
self
appreciation
and
leave
nothing
behind
but
the
cellar
when
you
compare
these
achievements
of
his
with
the
achievements
of
really
great
men
who
exist
in
history
the
comparison
i
believe
is
in
his
favor
i
am
not
here
to
disparage
columbus
no
i
won't
do
that
but
when
you
come
to
regard
the
achievements
of
these
two
men
columbus
and
stanley
from
the
standpoint
of
the
difficulties
they
encountered
the
advantage
is
with
stanley
and
against
columbus
now
columbus
started
out
to
discover
america
well
he
didn't
need
to
do
anything
at
all
but
sit
in
the
cabin
of
his
ship
and
hold
his
grip
and
sail
straight
on
and
america
would
discover
itself
here
it
was
barring
his
passage
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of
the
south
american
continent
and
he
couldn't
get
by
it
he'd
got
to
discover
it
but
stanley
started
out
to
find
doctor
livingstone
who
was
scattered
abroad
as
you
may
say
over
the
length
and
breadth
of
a
vast
slab
of
africa
as
big
as
the
united
states
it
was
a
blind
kind
of
search
he
was
the
worst
scattered
of
men
but
i
will
throw
the
weight
of
this
introduction
upon
one
very
peculiar
feature
of
mr
stanley's
character
and
that
is
his
indestructible
americanism
an
americanism
which
he
is
proud
of
and
in
this
day
and
time
when
it
is
the
custom
to
ape
and
imitate
english
methods
and
fashion
it
is
like
a
breath
of
fresh
air
to
stand
in
the
presence
of
this
untainted
american
citizen
who
has
been
caressed
and
complimented
by
half
of
the
crowned
heads
of
europe
who
could
clothe
his
body
from
his
head
to
his
heels
with
the
orders
and
decorations
lavished
upon
him
and
yet
when
the
untitled
myriads
of
his
own
country
put
out
their
hands
in
welcome
to
him
and
greet
him
well
done
through
the
congress
of
the
united
states
that
is
the
crown
that
is
worth
all
the
rest
to
him
he
is
a
product
of
institutions
which
exist
in
no
other
country
on
earth
institutions
that
bring
out
all
that
is
best
and
most
heroic
in
a
man
i
introduce
henry
m
stanley
dinner
to
mr
jerome
a
dinner
to
express
their
confidence
in
the
integrity
and
good
judgment
of
district
attorney
jerome
was
given
at
delmonico's
by
over
three
hundred
of
his
admirers
on
the
evening
of
may
indeed
that
is
very
sudden
i
was
not
informed
that
the
verdict
was
going
to
depend
upon
my
judgment
but
that
makes
not
the
least
difference
in
the
world
when
you
already
know
all
about
it
it
is
not
any
matter
when
you
are
called
upon
to
express
it
you
can
get
up
and
do
it
and
my
verdict
has
already
been
recorded
in
my
heart
and
in
my
head
as
regards
mr
jerome
and
his
administration
of
the
criminal
affairs
of
this
county
i
agree
with
everything
mr
choate
has
said
in
his
letter
regarding
mr
jerome
i
agree
with
everything
mr
shepard
has
said
and
i
agree
with
everything
mr
jerome
has
said
in
his
own
commendation
and
i
thought
mr
jerome
was
modest
in
that
if
he
had
been
talking
about
another
officer
of
this
county
he
could
have
painted
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
office
and
his
victories
in
even
stronger
language
than
he
did
i
voted
for
mr
jerome
in
those
old
days
and
i
should
like
to
vote
for
him
again
if
he
runs
for
any
office
i
moved
out
of
new
york
and
that
is
the
reason
i
suppose
i
cannot
vote
for
him
again
there
may
be
some
way
but
i
have
not
found
it
out
but
now
i
am
a
farmer
a
farmer
up
in
connecticut
and
winning
laurels
those
people
already
speak
with
such
high
favor
admiration
of
my
farming
and
they
say
that
i
am
the
only
man
that
has
ever
come
to
that
region
who
could
make
two
blades
of
grass
grow
where
only
three
grew
before
well
i
cannot
vote
for
him
you
see
that
as
it
stands
now
i
cannot
i
am
crippled
in
that
way
and
to
that
extent
for
i
would
ever
so
much
like
to
do
it
i
am
not
a
congress
and
i
cannot
distribute
pensions
and
i
don't
know
any
other
legitimate
way
to
buy
a
vote
but
if
i
should
think
of
any
legitimate
way
i
shall
make
use
of
it
and
then
i
shall
vote
for
mr
jerome
henry
irving
the
dramatic
and
literary
society
of
london
gave
a
welcome
home
dinner
to
sir
henry
irving
at
the
savoy
hotel
london
june
in
proposing
the
toast
of
the
drama
mr
clemens
said
i
find
my
task
a
very
easy
one
i
have
been
a
dramatist
for
thirty
years
i
have
had
an
ambition
in
all
that
time
to
overdo
the
work
of
the
spaniard
who
said
he
left
behind
him
four
hundred
dramas
when
he
died
i
leave
behind
me
four
hundred
and
fifteen
and
am
not
yet
dead
the
greatest
of
all
the
arts
is
to
write
a
drama
it
is
a
most
difficult
thing
it
requires
the
highest
talent
possible
and
the
rarest
gifts
no
there
is
another
talent
that
ranks
with
it
for
anybody
can
write
a
drama
i
had
four
hundred
of
them
but
to
get
one
accepted
requires
real
ability
and
i
have
never
had
that
felicity
yet
but
human
nature
is
so
constructed
we
are
so
persistent
that
when
we
know
that
we
are
born
to
a
thing
we
do
not
care
what
the
world
thinks
about
it
we
go
on
exploiting
that
talent
year
after
year
as
i
have
done
i
shall
go
on
writing
dramas
and
some
day
the
impossible
may
happen
but
i
am
not
looking
for
it
in
writing
plays
the
chief
thing
is
novelty
the
world
grows
tired
of
solid
forms
in
all
the
arts
i
struck
a
new
idea
myself
years
ago
i
was
not
surprised
at
it
i
was
always
expecting
it
would
happen
a
person
who
has
suffered
disappointment
for
many
years
loses
confidence
and
i
thought
i
had
better
make
inquiries
before
i
exploited
my
new
idea
of
doing
a
drama
in
the
form
of
a
dream
so
i
wrote
to
a
great
authority
on
knowledge
of
all
kinds
and
asked
him
whether
it
was
new
i
could
depend
upon
him
he
lived
in
my
dear
home
in
america
that
dear
home
dearer
to
me
through
taxes
he
sent
me
a
list
of
plays
in
which
that
old
device
had
been
used
and
he
said
that
there
was
also
a
modern
lot
he
travelled
back
to
china
and
to
a
play
dated
two
thousand
six
hundred
years
before
the
christian
era
he
said
he
would
follow
it
up
with
a
list
of
the
previous
plays
of
the
kind
and
in
his
innocence
would
have
carried
them
back
to
the
flood
that
is
the
most
discouraging
thing
that
has
ever
happened
to
me
in
my
dramatic
career
i
have
done
a
world
of
good
in
a
silent
and
private
way
and
have
furnished
sir
henry
irving
with
plays
and
plays
and
plays
what
has
he
achieved
through
that
influence
see
where
he
stands
now
on
the
summit
of
his
art
in
two
worlds
and
it
was
i
who
put
him
there
that
partly
put
him
there
i
need
not
enlarge
upon
the
influence
the
drama
has
exerted
upon
civilization
it
has
made
good
morals
entertaining
i
am
to
be
followed
by
mr
pinero
i
conceive
that
we
stand
at
the
head
of
the
profession
he
has
not
written
as
many
plays
as
i
have
but
he
has
lead
that
god
given
talent
which
i
lack
of
working
them
off
on
the
manager
i
couple
his
name
with
this
toast
and
add
the
hope
that
his
influence
will
be
supported
in
exercising
his
masterly
handicraft
in
that
great
gift
and
that
he
will
long
live
to
continue
his
fine
work
dinner
to
hamilton
w
mabie
address
delivered
april
in
introducing
mr
clemens
doctor
van
dyke
said
the
longer
the
speaking
goes
on
to
night
the
more
i
wonder
how
i
got
this
job
and
the
only
explanation
i
can
give
for
it
is
that
it
is
the
same
kind
of
compensation
for
the
number
of
articles
i
have
sent
to
the
outlook
to
be
rejected
by
hamilton
w
mabie
there
is
one
man
here
to
night
that
has
a
job
cut
out
for
him
that
none
of
you
would
have
had
a
man
whose
humor
has
put
a
girdle
of
light
around
the
globe
and
whose
sense
of
humor
has
been
an
example
for
all
five
continents
he
is
going
to
speak
to
you
gentlemen
you
know
him
best
as
mark
twain
mr
chairman
and
gentlemen
this
man
knows
now
how
it
feels
to
be
the
chief
guest
and
if
he
has
enjoyed
it
he
is
the
first
man
i
have
ever
seen
in
that
position
that
did
enjoy
it
and
i
know
by
side
remarks
which
he
made
to
me
before
his
ordeal
came
upon
him
that
he
was
feeling
as
some
of
the
rest
of
us
have
felt
under
the
same
circumstances
he
was
afraid
that
he
would
not
do
himself
justice
but
he
did
to
my
surprise
it
is
a
most
serious
thing
to
be
a
chief
guest
on
an
occasion
like
this
and
it
is
admirable
it
is
fine
it
is
a
great
compliment
to
a
man
that
he
shall
come
out
of
it
so
gloriously
as
mr
mabie
came
out
of
it
tonight
to
my
surprise
he
did
it
well
he
appears
to
be
editor
of
the
outlook
and
notwithstanding
that
i
have
every
admiration
because
when
everything
is
said
concerning
the
outlook
after
all
one
must
admit
that
it
is
frank
in
its
delinquencies
that
it
is
outspoken
in
its
departures
from
fact
that
it
is
vigorous
in
its
mistaken
criticisms
of
men
like
me
i
have
lived
in
this
world
a
long
long
time
and
i
know
you
must
not
judge
a
man
by
the
editorials
that
he
puts
in
his
paper
a
man
is
always
better
than
his
printed
opinions
a
man
always
reserves
to
himself
on
the
inside
a
purity
and
an
honesty
and
a
justice
that
are
a
credit
to
him
whereas
the
things
that
he
prints
are
just
the
reverse
oh
yes
you
must
not
judge
a
man
by
what
he
writes
in
his
paper
even
in
an
ordinary
secular
paper
a
man
must
observe
some
care
about
it
he
must
be
better
than
the
principles
which
he
puts
in
print
and
that
is
the
case
with
mr
mabie
why
to
see
what
he
writes
about
me
and
the
missionaries
you
would
think
he
did
not
have
any
principles
but
that
is
mr
mabie
in
his
public
capacity
mr
mabie
in
his
private
capacity
is
just
as
clean
a
man
as
i
am
in
this
very
room
a
month
or
two
ago
some
people
admired
that
portrait
some
admired
this
but
the
great
majority
fastened
on
that
and
said
there
is
a
portrait
that
is
a
beautiful
piece
of
art
when
that
portrait
is
a
hundred
years
old
it
will
suggest
what
were
the
manners
and
customs
in
our
time
just
as
they
talk
about
mr
mabie
to
night
in
that
enthusiastic
way
pointing
out
the
various
virtues
of
the
man
and
the
grace
of
his
spirit
and
all
that
so
was
that
portrait
talked
about
they
were
enthusiastic
just
as
we
men
have
been
over
the
character
and
the
work
of
mr
mabie
and
when
they
were
through
they
said
that
portrait
fine
as
it
is
that
work
beautiful
as
it
is
that
piece
of
humanity
on
that
canvas
gracious
and
fine
as
it
is
does
not
rise
to
those
perfections
that
exist
in
the
man
himself
come
up
mr
alexander
reference
was
to
james
w
alexander
who
happened
to
be
sitting
beneath
the
portrait
of
himself
on
the
wall
now
i
should
come
up
and
show
myself
but
he
cannot
do
it
he
cannot
do
it
he
was
born
that
way
he
was
reared
in
that
way
let
his
modesty
be
an
example
and
i
wish
some
of
you
had
it
too
but
that
is
just
what
i
have
been
saying
that
portrait
fine
as
it
is
is
not
as
fine
as
the
man
it
represents
and
all
the
things
that
have
been
said
about
mr
mabie
and
certainly
they
have
been
very
nobly
worded
and
beautiful
still
fall
short
of
the
real
mabie
introducing
nye
and
riley
james
whitcomb
riley
and
edgar
wilson
nye
bill
nye
were
to
give
readings
in
tremont
temple
boston
november
mr
clemens
was
induced
to
introduce
messrs
riley
and
nye
his
appearance
on
the
platform
was
a
surprise
to
the
audience
and
when
they
recognized
him
there
was
a
tremendous
demonstration
i
am
very
glad
indeed
to
introduce
these
young
people
to
you
and
at
the
same
time
get
acquainted
with
them
myself
i
have
seen
them
more
than
once
for
a
moment
but
have
not
had
the
privilege
of
knowing
them
personally
as
intimately
as
i
wanted
to
i
saw
them
first
a
great
many
years
ago
when
mr
barnum
had
them
and
they
were
just
fresh
from
siam
the
ligature
was
their
best
hold
then
the
literature
became
their
best
hold
later
when
one
of
them
committed
an
indiscretion
and
they
had
to
cut
the
old
bond
to
accommodate
the
sheriff
in
that
old
former
time
this
one
was
chang
that
one
was
eng
the
sympathy
existing
between
the
two
was
most
extraordinary
it
was
so
fine
so
strong
so
subtle
that
what
the
one
ate
the
other
digested
when
one
slept
the
other
snored
if
one
sold
a
thing
the
other
scooped
the
usufruct
this
independent
and
yet
dependent
action
was
observable
in
all
the
details
of
their
daily
life
i
mean
this
quaint
and
arbitrary
distribution
of
originating
cause
and
resulting
effect
between
the
two
between
i
may
say
this
dynamo
and
the
other
always
motor
or
in
other
words
that
the
one
was
always
the
creating
force
the
other
always
the
utilizing
force
no
no
for
while
it
is
true
that
within
certain
well
defined
zones
of
activity
the
one
was
always
dynamo
and
the
other
always
motor
within
certain
other
well
defined
zones
these
positions
became
exactly
reversed
for
instance
in
moral
matters
mr
chang
riley
was
always
dynamo
mr
eng
nye
was
always
motor
for
while
mr
chang
riley
had
a
high
in
fact
an
abnormally
high
and
fine
moral
sense
he
had
no
machinery
to
work
it
with
whereas
mr
eng
nye
who
hadn't
any
moral
sense
at
all
and
hasn't
yet
was
equipped
with
all
the
necessary
plant
for
putting
a
noble
deed
through
if
he
could
only
get
the
inspiration
on
reasonable
terms
outside
in
intellectual
matters
on
the
other
hand
mr
eng
nye
was
always
dynamo
mr
chang
riley
was
always
motor
mr
eng
nye
had
a
stately
intellect
but
couldn't
make
it
go
mr
chang
riley
hadn't
but
could
that
is
to
say
that
while
mr
chang
riley
couldn't
think
things
himself
he
had
a
marvellous
natural
grace
in
setting
them
down
and
weaving
them
together
when
his
pal
furnished
the
raw
material
thus
working
together
they
made
a
strong
team
laboring
together
they
could
do
miracles
but
break
the
circuit
and
both
were
impotent
it
has
remained
so
to
this
day
they
must
travel
together
hoe
and
plant
and
plough
and
reap
and
sell
their
public
together
or
there's
no
result
i
have
made
this
explanation
this
analysis
this
vivisection
so
to
speak
in
order
that
you
may
enjoy
these
delightful
adventurers
understandingly
when
mr
eng
nye's
deep
and
broad
and
limpid
philosophies
flow
by
in
front
of
you
refreshing
all
the
regions
round
about
with
their
gracious
floods
you
will
remember
that
it
isn't
his
water
it's
the
other
man's
and
he
is
only
working
the
pump
and
when
mr
chang
riley
enchants
your
ear
and
soothes
your
spirit
and
touches
your
heart
with
the
sweet
and
genuine
music
of
his
poetry
as
sweet
and
as
genuine
as
any
that
his
friends
the
birds
and
the
bees
make
about
his
other
friends
the
woods
and
the
flowers
you
will
remember
while
placing
justice
where
justice
is
due
that
it
isn't
his
music
but
the
other
man's
he
is
only
turning
the
crank
i
beseech
for
these
visitors
a
fair
field
a
singleminded
one
eyed
umpire
and
a
score
bulletin
barren
of
goose
eggs
if
they
earn
it
and
i
judge
they
will
and
hope
they
will
mr
james
whitcomb
chang
riley
will
now
go
to
the
bat
dinner
to
whitelaw
reid
address
at
the
dinner
in
honor
of
ambassador
reid
given
by
the
pilgrims
club
of
new
york
on
february
i
am
very
proud
to
respond
to
this
toast
as
it
recalls
the
proudest
day
of
my
life
the
delightful
hospitality
shown
me
at
the
time
of
my
visit
to
oxford
i
shall
cherish
until
i
die
in
that
long
and
distinguished
career
of
mine
i
value
that
degree
above
all
other
honors
when
the
ship
landed
even
the
stevedores
gathered
on
the
shore
and
gave
an
english
cheer
nothing
could
surpass
in
my
life
the
pleasure
of
those
four
weeks
no
one
could
pass
by
me
without
taking
my
hand
even
the
policemen
i've
been
in
all
the
principal
capitals
of
christendom
in
my
life
and
have
always
been
an
object
of
interest
to
policemen
sometimes
there
was
suspicion
in
their
eyes
but
not
always
with
their
puissant
hand
they
would
hold
up
the
commerce
of
the
world
to
let
me
pass
i
noticed
in
the
papers
this
afternoon
a
despatch
from
washington
saying
that
congress
would
immediately
pass
a
bill
restoring
to
our
gold
coinage
the
motto
in
god
we
trust
i'm
glad
of
that
i'm
glad
of
that
i
was
troubled
when
that
motto
was
removed
sure
enough
the
prosperities
of
the
whole
nation
went
down
in
a
heap
when
we
ceased
to
trust
in
god
in
that
conspicuously
advertised
way
i
knew
there
would
be
trouble
and
if
pierpont
morgan
hadn't
stepped
in
bishop
lawrence
may
now
add
to
his
message
to
the
old
country
that
we
are
now
trusting
in
god
again
so
we
can
discharge
mr
morgan
from
his
office
with
honor
mr
reid
said
an
hour
or
so
ago
something
about
my
ruining
my
activities
last
summer
they
are
not
ruined
they
are
renewed
i
am
stronger
now
much
stronger
i
suppose
that
the
spiritual
uplift
i
received
increased
my
physical
power
more
than
anything
i
ever
had
before
i
was
dancing
last
night
at
o'clock
mr
choate
has
mentioned
mr
reid's
predecessors
mr
choate's
head
is
full
of
history
and
some
of
it
is
true
too
i
enjoyed
hearing
him
tell
about
the
list
of
the
men
who
had
the
place
before
he
did
he
mentioned
a
long
list
of
those
predecessors
people
i
never
heard
of
before
and
elected
five
of
them
to
the
presidency
by
his
own
vote
i'm
glad
and
proud
to
find
mr
reid
in
that
high
position
because
he
didn't
look
it
when
i
knew
him
forty
years
ago
i
was
talking
to
reid
the
other
day
and
he
showed
me
my
autograph
on
an
old
paper
twenty
years
old
i
didn't
know
i
had
an
autograph
twenty
years
ago
nobody
ever
asked
me
for
it
i
remember
a
dinner
i
had
long
ago
with
whitelaw
reid
and
john
hay
at
reid's
expense
i
had
another
last
summer
when
i
was
in
london
at
the
embassy
that
choate
blackguards
so
i'd
like
to
live
there
some
people
say
they
couldn't
live
on
the
salary
but
i
could
live
on
the
salary
and
the
nation
together
some
of
us
don't
appreciate
what
this
country
can
do
there's
john
hay
reid
choate
and
me
this
is
the
only
country
in
the
world
where
youth
talent
and
energy
can
reach
such
heights
it
shows
what
we
could
do
without
means
and
what
people
can
do
with
talent
and
energy
when
they
find
it
in
people
like
us
when
i
first
came
to
new
york
they
were
all
struggling
young
men
and
i
am
glad
to
see
that
they
have
got
on
in
the
world
i
knew
john
hay
when
i
had
no
white
hairs
in
my
head
and
more
hair
than
reid
has
now
those
were
days
of
joy
and
hope
reid
and
hay
were
on
the
staff
of
the
tribune
i
went
there
once
in
that
old
building
and
i
looked
all
around
and
i
finally
found
a
door
ajar
and
looked
in
it
wasn't
reid
or
hay
there
but
it
was
horace
greeley
those
were
in
the
days
when
horace
greeley
was
a
king
that
was
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
him
and
the
last
i
was
admiring
him
when
he
stopped
and
seemed
to
realize
that
there
was
a
fine
presence
there
somewhere
he
tried
to
smile
but
he
was
out
of
smiles
he
looked
at
me
a
moment
and
said
what
in
h
do
you
want
he
began
with
that
word
h
that's
a
long
word
and
a
profane
word
i
don't
remember
what
the
word
was
now
but
i
recognized
the
power
of
it
i
had
never
used
that
language
myself
but
at
that
moment
i
was
converted
it
has
been
a
great
refuge
for
me
in
time
of
trouble
if
a
man
doesn't
know
that
language
he
can't
express
himself
on
strenuous
occasions
when
you
have
that
word
at
your
command
let
trouble
come
but
later
hay
rose
and
you
know
what
summit
whitelaw
reid
has
reached
and
you
see
me
those
two
men
have
regulated
troubles
of
nations
and
conferred
peace
upon
mankind
and
in
my
humble
way
of
which
i
am
quite
vain
i
was
the
principal
moral
force
in
all
those
great
international
movements
these
great
men
illustrated
what
i
say
look
at
us
great
people
we
all
come
from
the
dregs
of
society
that's
what
can
be
done
in
this
country
that's
what
this
country
does
for
you
choate
here
he
hasn't
got
anything
to
say
but
he
says
it
just
the
same
and
he
can
do
it
so
felicitously
too
i
said
long
ago
he
was
the
handsomest
man
america
ever
produced
may
the
progress
of
civilization
always
rest
on
such
distinguished
men
as
it
has
in
the
past
rogers
and
railroads
at
a
banquet
given
mr
h
h
rogers
by
the
business
men
of
norfolk
va
celebrating
the
opening
of
the
virginian
railway
april
toastmaster
i
have
often
thought
that
when
the
time
comes
which
must
come
to
all
of
us
when
we
reach
that
great
way
in
the
great
beyond
and
the
question
is
propounded
what
have
you
done
to
gain
admission
into
this
great
realm
if
the
answer
could
be
sincerely
made
i
have
made
men
laugh
it
would
be
the
surest
passport
to
a
welcome
entrance
we
have
here
to
night
one
who
has
made
millions
laugh
not
the
loud
laughter
that
bespeaks
the
vacant
mind
but
the
laugh
of
intelligent
mirth
that
helps
the
human
heart
and
the
human
mind
i
refer
of
course
to
doctor
clemens
i
was
going
to
say
mark
twain
his
literary
title
which
is
a
household
phrase
in
more
homes
than
that
of
any
other
man
and
you
know
him
best
by
that
dear
old
title
i
thank
you
mr
toastmaster
for
the
compliment
which
you
have
paid
me
and
i
am
sure
i
would
rather
have
made
people
laugh
than
cry
yet
in
my
time
i
have
made
some
of
them
cry
and
before
i
stop
entirely
i
hope
to
make
some
more
of
them
cry
i
like
compliments
i
deal
in
them
myself
i
have
listened
with
the
greatest
pleasure
to
the
compliments
which
the
chairman
has
paid
to
mr
rogers
and
that
road
of
his
to
night
and
i
hope
some
of
them
are
deserved
it
is
no
small
distinction
to
a
man
like
that
to
sit
here
before
an
intelligent
crowd
like
this
and
to
be
classed
with
napoleon
and
caesar
why
didn't
he
say
that
this
was
the
proudest
day
of
his
life
napoleon
and
caesar
are
dead
and
they
can't
be
here
to
defend
themselves
but
i'm
here
the
chairman
said
and
very
truly
that
the
most
lasting
thing
in
the
hands
of
man
are
the
roads
which
caesar
built
and
it
is
true
that
he
built
a
lot
of
them
and
they
are
there
yet
yes
caesar
built
a
lot
of
roads
in
england
and
you
can
find
them
but
rogers
has
only
built
one
road
and
he
hasn't
finished
that
yet
i
like
to
hear
my
old
friend
complimented
but
i
don't
like
to
hear
it
overdone
i
didn't
go
around
to
day
with
the
others
to
see
what
he
is
doing
i
will
do
that
in
a
quiet
time
when
there
is
not
anything
going
on
and
when
i
shall
not
be
called
upon
to
deliver
intemperate
compliments
on
a
railroad
in
which
i
own
no
stock
they
proposed
that
i
go
along
with
the
committee
and
help
inspect
that
dump
down
yonder
i
didn't
go
i
saw
that
dump
i
saw
that
thing
when
i
was
coming
in
on
the
steamer
and
i
didn't
go
because
i
was
diffident
sentimentally
diffident
about
going
and
looking
at
that
thing
again
that
great
long
bony
thing
it
looked
just
like
mr
rogers's
foot
the
chairman
says
mr
rogers
is
full
of
practical
wisdom
and
he
is
it
is
intimated
here
that
he
is
a
very
ingenious
man
and
he
is
a
very
competent
financier
maybe
he
is
now
but
it
was
not
always
so
i
know
lots
of
private
things
in
his
life
which
people
don't
know
and
i
know
how
he
started
and
it
was
not
a
very
good
start
i
could
have
done
better
myself
the
first
time
he
crossed
the
atlantic
he
had
just
made
the
first
little
strike
in
oil
and
he
was
so
young
he
did
not
like
to
ask
questions
he
did
not
like
to
appear
ignorant
to
this
day
he
don't
like
to
appear
ignorant
but
he
can
look
as
ignorant
as
anybody
on
board
the
ship
they
were
betting
on
the
run
of
the
ship
betting
a
couple
of
shillings
or
half
a
crown
and
they
proposed
that
this
youth
from
the
oil
regions
should
bet
on
the
run
of
the
ship
he
did
not
like
to
ask
what
a
half
crown
was
and
he
didn't
know
but
rather
than
be
ashamed
of
himself
he
did
bet
half
a
crown
on
the
run
of
the
ship
and
in
bed
he
could
not
sleep
he
wondered
if
he
could
afford
that
outlay
in
case
he
lost
he
kept
wondering
over
it
and
said
to
himself
a
king's
crown
must
be
worth
so
half
a
crown
would
cost
he
could
not
afford
to
bet
away
on
the
run
of
the
ship
so
he
went
up
to
the
stakeholder
and
gave
him
to
let
him
off
i
like
to
hear
mr
rogers
complimented
i
am
not
stingy
in
compliments
to
him
myself
why
i
did
it
to
day
when
i
sent
his
wife
a
telegram
to
comfort
her
that
is
the
kind
of
person
i
am
i
knew
she
would
be
uneasy
about
him
i
knew
she
would
be
solicitous
about
what
he
might
do
down
here
so
i
did
it
to
quiet
her
and
to
comfort
her
i
said
he
was
doing
well
for
a
person
out
of
practice
there
is
nothing
like
it
he
is
like
i
used
to
be
there
were
times
when
i
was
careless
careless
in
my
dress
when
i
got
older
you
know
how
uncomfortable
your
wife
can
get
when
you
are
going
away
without
her
superintendence
once
when
my
wife
could
not
go
with
me
she
always
went
with
me
when
she
could
i
always
did
meet
that
kind
of
luck
i
was
going
to
washington
once
a
long
time
ago
in
mr
cleveland's
first
administration
and
she
could
not
go
but
in
her
anxiety
that
i
should
not
desecrate
the
house
she
made
preparation
she
knew
that
there
was
to
be
a
reception
of
those
authors
at
the
white
house
at
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
she
said
if
i
should
tell
you
now
what
i
want
to
ask
of
you
you
would
forget
it
before
you
get
to
washington
and
therefore
i
have
written
it
on
a
card
and
you
will
find
it
in
your
dress
vest
pocket
when
you
are
dressing
at
the
arlington
when
you
are
dressing
to
see
the
president
i
never
thought
of
it
again
until
i
was
dressing
and
i
felt
in
that
pocket
and
took
it
out
and
it
said
in
a
kind
of
imploring
way
don't
wear
your
arctics
in
the
white
house
you
complimented
mr
rogers
on
his
energy
his
foresightedness
complimented
him
in
various
ways
and
he
has
deserved
those
compliments
although
i
say
it
myself
and
i
enjoy
them
all
there
is
one
side
of
mr
rogers
that
has
not
been
mentioned
if
you
will
leave
that
to
me
i
will
touch
upon
that
there
was
a
note
in
an
editorial
in
one
of
the
norfolk
papers
this
morning
that
touched
upon
that
very
thing
that
hidden
side
of
mr
rogers
where
it
spoke
of
helen
keller
and
her
affection
for
mr
rogers
to
whom
she
dedicated
her
life
book
and
she
has
a
right
to
feel
that
way
because
without
the
public
knowing
anything
about
it
he
rescued
if
i
may
use
that
term
that
marvellous
girl
that
wonderful
southern
girl
that
girl
who
was
stone
deaf
blind
and
dumb
from
scarlet
fever
when
she
was
a
baby
eighteen
months
old
and
who
now
is
as
well
and
thoroughly
educated
as
any
woman
on
this
planet
at
twenty
nine
years
of
age
she
is
the
most
marvellous
person
of
her
sex
that
has
existed
on
this
earth
since
joan
of
arc
that
is
not
all
mr
rogers
has
done
but
you
never
see
that
side
of
his
character
because
it
is
never
protruding
but
he
lends
a
helping
hand
daily
out
of
that
generous
heart
of
his
you
never
hear
of
it
he
is
supposed
to
be
a
moon
which
has
one
side
dark
and
the
other
bright
but
the
other
side
though
you
don't
see
it
is
not
dark
it
is
bright
and
its
rays
penetrate
and
others
do
see
it
who
are
not
god
i
would
take
this
opportunity
to
tell
something
that
i
have
never
been
allowed
to
tell
by
mr
rogers
either
by
my
mouth
or
in
print
and
if
i
don't
look
at
him
i
can
tell
it
now
in
when
the
publishing
company
of
charles
l
webster
of
which
i
was
financial
agent
failed
it
left
me
heavily
in
debt
if
you
will
remember
what
commerce
was
at
that
time
you
will
recall
that
you
could
not
sell
anything
and
could
not
buy
anything
and
i
was
on
my
back
my
books
were
not
worth
anything
at
all
and
i
could
not
give
away
my
copyrights
mr
rogers
had
long
enough
vision
ahead
to
say
your
books
have
supported
you
before
and
after
the
panic
is
over
they
will
support
you
again
and
that
was
a
correct
proposition
he
saved
my
copyrights
and
saved
me
from
financial
ruin
he
it
was
who
arranged
with
my
creditors
to
allow
me
to
roam
the
face
of
the
earth
for
four
years
and
persecute
the
nations
thereof
with
lectures
promising
that
at
the
end
of
four
years
i
would
pay
dollar
for
dollar
that
arrangement
was
made
otherwise
i
would
now
be
living
out
of
doors
under
an
umbrella
and
a
borrowed
one
at
that
you
see
his
white
mustache
and
his
head
trying
to
get
white
he
is
always
trying
to
look
like
me
i
don't
blame
him
for
that
these
are
only
emblematic
of
his
character
and
that
is
all
i
say
without
exception
hair
and
all
he
is
the
whitest
man
i
have
ever
known
the
old
fashioned
printer
address
at
the
typothetae
dinner
given
at
delmonico's
january
commemorating
the
birthday
of
benjamin
franklin
mr
clemens
responded
to
the
toast
the
compositor
the
chairman's
historical
reminiscences
of
gutenberg
have
caused
me
to
fall
into
reminiscences
for
i
myself
am
something
of
an
antiquity
all
things
change
in
the
procession
of
years
and
it
may
be
that
i
am
among
strangers
it
may
be
that
the
printer
of
to
day
is
not
the
printer
of
thirty
five
years
ago
i
was
no
stranger
to
him
i
knew
him
well
i
built
his
fire
for
him
in
the
winter
mornings
i
brought
his
water
from
the
village
pump
i
swept
out
his
office
i
picked
up
his
type
from
under
his
stand
and
if
he
were
there
to
see
i
put
the
good
type
in
his
case
and
the
broken
ones
among
the
hell
matter
and
if
he
wasn't
there
to
see
i
dumped
it
all
with
the
pi
on
the
imposing
stone
for
that
was
the
furtive
fashion
of
the
cub
and
i
was
a
cub
i
wetted
down
the
paper
saturdays
i
turned
it
sundays
for
this
was
a
country
weekly
i
rolled
i
washed
the
rollers
i
washed
the
forms
i
folded
the
papers
i
carried
them
around
at
dawn
thursday
mornings
the
carrier
was
then
an
object
of
interest
to
all
the
dogs
in
town
if
i
had
saved
up
all
the
bites
i
ever
received
i
could
keep
m
pasteur
busy
for
a
year
i
enveloped
the
papers
that
were
for
the
mail
we
had
a
hundred
town
subscribers
and
three
hundred
and
fifty
country
ones
the
town
subscribers
paid
in
groceries
and
the
country
ones
in
cabbages
and
cord
wood
when
they
paid
at
all
which
was
merely
sometimes
and
then
we
always
stated
the
fact
in
the
paper
and
gave
them
a
puff
and
if
we
forgot
it
they
stopped
the
paper
every
man
on
the
town
list
helped
edit
the
thing
that
is
he
gave
orders
as
to
how
it
was
to
be
edited
dictated
its
opinions
marked
out
its
course
for
it
and
every
time
the
boss
failed
to
connect
he
stopped
his
paper
we
were
just
infested
with
critics
and
we
tried
to
satisfy
them
all
over
we
had
one
subscriber
who
paid
cash
and
he
was
more
trouble
than
all
the
rest
he
bought
us
once
a
year
body
and
soul
for
two
dollars
he
used
to
modify
our
politics
every
which
way
and
he
made
us
change
our
religion
four
times
in
five
years
if
we
ever
tried
to
reason
with
him
he
would
threaten
to
stop
his
paper
and
of
course
that
meant
bankruptcy
and
destruction
that
man
used
to
write
articles
a
column
and
a
half
long
leaded
long
primer
and
sign
them
junius
or
veritas
or
vox
populi
or
some
other
high
sounding
rot
and
then
after
it
was
set
up
he
would
come
in
and
say
he
had
changed
his
mind
which
was
a
gilded
figure
of
speech
because
he
hadn't
any
and
order
it
to
be
left
out
we
couldn't
afford
bogus
in
that
office
so
we
always
took
the
leads
out
altered
the
signature
credited
the
article
to
the
rival
paper
in
the
next
village
and
put
it
in
well
we
did
have
one
or
two
kinds
of
bogus
whenever
there
was
a
barbecue
or
a
circus
or
a
baptizing
we
knocked
off
for
half
a
day
and
then
to
make
up
for
short
matter
we
would
turn
over
ads
turn
over
the
whole
page
and
duplicate
it
the
other
bogus
was
deep
philosophical
stuff
which
we
judged
nobody
ever
read
so
we
kept
a
galley
of
it
standing
and
kept
on
slapping
the
same
old
batches
of
it
in
every
now
and
then
till
it
got
dangerous
also
in
the
early
days
of
the
telegraph
we
used
to
economize
on
the
news
we
picked
out
the
items
that
were
pointless
and
barren
of
information
and
stood
them
on
a
galley
and
changed
the
dates
and
localities
and
used
them
over
and
over
again
till
the
public
interest
in
them
was
worn
to
the
bone
we
marked
the
ads
but
we
seldom
paid
any
attention
to
the
marks
afterward
so
the
life
of
a
td
ad
and
a
tf
ad
was
equally
eternal
i
have
seen
a
td
notice
of
a
sheriff's
sale
still
booming
serenely
along
two
years
after
the
sale
was
over
the
sheriff
dead
and
the
whole
circumstance
become
ancient
history
most
of
the
yearly
ads
were
patent
medicine
stereotypes
and
we
used
to
fence
with
them
i
can
see
that
printing
office
of
prehistoric
times
yet
with
its
horse
bills
on
the
walls
its
d
boxes
clogged
with
tallow
because
we
always
stood
the
candle
in
the
k
box
nights
its
towel
which
was
not
considered
soiled
until
it
could
stand
alone
and
other
signs
and
symbols
that
marked
the
establishment
of
that
kind
in
the
mississippi
valley
and
i
can
see
also
the
tramping
jour
who
flitted
by
in
the
summer
and
tarried
a
day
with
his
wallet
stuffed
with
one
shirt
and
a
hatful
of
handbills
for
if
he
couldn't
get
any
type
to
set
he
would
do
a
temperance
lecture
his
way
of
life
was
simple
his
needs
not
complex
all
he
wanted
was
plate
and
bed
and
money
enough
to
get
drunk
on
and
he
was
satisfied
but
it
may
be
as
i
have
said
that
i
am
among
strangers
and
sing
the
glories
of
a
forgotten
age
to
unfamiliar
ears
so
i
will
make
even
and
stop
society
of
american
authors
on
november
the
society
gave
a
reception
to
mr
clemens
who
came
with
his
wife
and
daughter
so
many
members
surrounded
the
guests
that
mr
clemens
asked
is
this
genuine
popularity
or
is
it
all
a
part
of
a
prearranged
programme
mr
chairman
ladies
and
gentlemen
it
seems
a
most
difficult
thing
for
any
man
to
say
anything
about
me
that
is
not
complimentary
i
don't
know
what
the
charm
is
about
me
which
makes
it
impossible
for
a
person
to
say
a
harsh
thing
about
me
and
say
it
heartily
as
if
he
was
glad
to
say
it
if
this
thing
keeps
on
it
will
make
me
believe
that
i
am
what
these
kind
chairmen
say
of
me
in
introducing
me
judge
ransom
spoke
of
my
modesty
as
if
he
was
envious
of
me
i
would
like
to
have
one
man
come
out
flat
footed
and
say
something
harsh
and
disparaging
of
me
even
if
it
were
true
i
thought
at
one
time
as
the
learned
judge
was
speaking
that
i
had
found
that
man
but
he
wound
up
like
all
the
others
by
saying
complimentary
things
i
am
constructed
like
everybody
else
and
enjoy
a
compliment
as
well
as
any
other
fool
but
i
do
like
to
have
the
other
side
presented
and
there
is
another
side
i
have
a
wicked
side
estimable
friends
who
know
all
about
it
would
tell
you
and
take
a
certain
delight
in
telling
you
things
that
i
have
done
and
things
further
that
i
have
not
repented
the
real
life
that
i
live
and
the
real
life
that
i
suppose
all
of
you
live
is
a
life
of
interior
sin
that
is
what
makes
life
valuable
and
pleasant
to
lead
a
life
of
undiscovered
sin
that
is
true
joy
judge
ransom
seems
to
have
all
the
virtues
that
he
ascribes
to
me
but
oh
my
if
you
could
throw
an
x
ray
through
him
we
are
a
pair
i
have
made
a
life
study
of
trying
to
appear
to
be
what
he
seems
to
think
i
am
everybody
believes
that
i
am
a
monument
of
all
the
virtues
but
it
is
nothing
of
the
sort
i
am
living
two
lives
and
it
keeps
me
pretty
busy
some
day
there
will
be
a
chairman
who
will
forget
some
of
these
merits
of
mine
and
then
he
will
make
a
speech
i
have
more
personal
vanity
than
modesty
and
twice
as
much
veracity
as
the
two
put
together
when
that
fearless
and
forgetful
chairman
is
found
there
will
be
another
story
told
at
the
press
club
recently
i
thought
that
i
had
found
him
he
started
in
in
the
way
that
i
knew
i
should
be
painted
with
all
sincerity
and
was
leading
to
things
that
would
not
be
to
my
credit
but
when
he
said
that
he
never
read
a
book
of
mine
i
knew
at
once
that
he
was
a
liar
because
he
never
could
have
had
all
the
wit
and
intelligence
with
which
he
was
blessed
unless
he
had
read
my
works
as
a
basis
i
like
compliments
i
like
to
go
home
and
tell
them
all
over
again
to
the
members
of
my
family
they
don't
believe
them
but
i
like
to
tell
them
in
the
home
circle
all
the
same
i
like
to
dream
of
them
if
i
can
i
thank
everybody
for
their
compliments
but
i
don't
think
that
i
am
praised
any
more
than
i
am
entitled
to
be
reading
room
opening
on
october
mr
clemens
made
his
last
address
preceding
his
departure
for
america
at
kensal
rise
london
i
formally
declare
this
reading
room
open
and
i
think
that
the
legislature
should
not
compel
a
community
to
provide
itself
with
intelligent
food
but
give
it
the
privilege
of
providing
it
if
the
community
so
desires
if
the
community
is
anxious
to
have
a
reading
room
it
would
put
its
hand
in
its
pocket
and
bring
out
the
penny
tax
i
think
it
a
proof
of
the
healthy
moral
financial
and
mental
condition
of
the
community
if
it
taxes
itself
for
its
mental
food
a
reading
room
is
the
proper
introduction
to
a
library
leading
up
through
the
newspapers
and
magazines
to
other
literature
what
would
we
do
without
newspapers
look
at
the
rapid
manner
in
which
the
news
of
the
galveston
disaster
was
made
known
to
the
entire
world
this
reminds
me
of
an
episode
which
occurred
fifteen
years
ago
when
i
was
at
church
in
hartford
connecticut
the
clergyman
decided
to
make
a
collection
for
the
survivors
if
any
he
did
not
include
me
among
the
leading
citizens
who
took
the
plates
around
for
collection
i
complained
to
the
governor
of
his
lack
of
financial
trust
in
me
and
he
replied
i
would
trust
you
myself
if
you
had
a
bell
punch
you
have
paid
me
many
compliments
and
i
like
to
listen
to
compliments
i
indorse
all
your
chairman
has
said
to
you
about
the
union
of
england
and
america
he
also
alluded
to
my
name
of
which
i
am
rather
fond
a
little
girl
wrote
me
from
new
zealand
in
a
letter
i
received
yesterday
stating
that
her
father
said
my
proper
name
was
not
mark
twain
but
samuel
clemens
but
that
she
knew
better
because
clemens
was
the
name
of
the
man
who
sold
the
patent
medicine
and
his
name
was
not
mark
she
was
sure
it
was
mark
twain
because
mark
is
in
the
bible
and
twain
is
in
the
bible
i
was
very
glad
to
get
that
expression
of
confidence
in
my
origin
and
as
i
now
know
my
name
to
be
a
scriptural
one
i
am
not
without
hopes
of
making
it
worthy
literature
address
at
the
royal
literary
fund
banquet
london
may
anthony
hope
introduced
mr
clemens
to
make
the
response
to
the
toast
literature
mr
hope
has
been
able
to
deal
adequately
with
this
toast
without
assistance
from
me
still
i
was
born
generous
if
he
had
advanced
any
theories
that
needed
refutation
or
correction
i
would
have
attended
to
them
and
if
he
had
made
any
statements
stronger
than
those
which
he
is
in
the
habit
of
making
i
would
have
dealt
with
them
in
fact
i
was
surprised
at
the
mildness
of
his
statements
i
could
not
have
made
such
statements
if
i
had
preferred
to
because
to
exaggerate
is
the
only
way
i
can
approximate
to
the
truth
you
cannot
have
a
theory
without
principles
principles
is
another
name
for
prejudices
i
have
no
prejudices
in
politics
religion
literature
or
anything
else
i
am
now
on
my
way
to
my
own
country
to
run
for
the
presidency
because
there
are
not
yet
enough
candidates
in
the
field
and
those
who
have
entered
are
too
much
hampered
by
their
own
principles
which
are
prejudices
i
propose
to
go
there
to
purify
the
political
atmosphere
i
am
in
favor
of
everything
everybody
is
in
favor
of
what
you
should
do
is
to
satisfy
the
whole
nation
not
half
of
it
for
then
you

i
have

read

in
a

article
that
christendom
issued
last
year
fifty
five
thousand
new
books
consider
what
that
means
fifty
five
thousand
new
books
meant
fifty
four

are
going

disappearance
of
literature
address
at
the
dinner
of
the
nineteenth
century
club
at
sherry's
new
york
november
mr
clemens
spoke
to
the
toast
the
disappearance
of
literature
doctor
gould
presided
and
in
introducing
mr
clemens
said
that
he
the
speaker
when
in
germany
had
to
do
a
lot
of
apologizing
for
a
certain
literary
man
who
was
taking
what
the
germans
thought
undue
liberties
with
their
language
it
wasn't
necessary
for
your
chairman
to
apologize
for
me
in
germany
it
wasn't
necessary
at
all
instead
of
that
he
ought
to
have
impressed
upon
those
poor
benighted
teutons
the
service
i
rendered
them
their
language
had
needed
untangling
for
a
good
many
years
nobody
else
seemed
to
want
to
take
the
job
and
so
i
took
it
and
i
flatter
myself
that
i
made
a
pretty
good
job
of
it
the
germans
have
an
inhuman
way
of
cutting
up
their
verbs
now
a
verb
has
a
hard
time
enough
of
it
in
this
world
when
it's
all
together
it's
downright
inhuman
to
split
it
up
but
that's
just
what
those
germans
do
they
take
part
of
a
verb
and
put
it
down
here
like
a
stake
and
they
take
the
other
part
of
it
and
put
it
away
over
yonder
like
another
stake
and
between
these
two
limits
they
just
shovel
in
german
i
maintain
that
there
is
no
necessity
for
apologizing
for
a
man
who
helped
in
a
small
way
to
stop
such
mutilation
we
have
heard
a
discussion
to
night
on
the
disappearance
of
literature
that's
no
new
thing
that's
what
certain
kinds
of
literature
have
been
doing
for
several
years
the
fact
is
my
friends
that
the
fashion
in
literature
changes
and
the
literary
tailors
have
to
change
their
cuts
or
go
out
of
business
professor
winchester
here
if
i
remember
fairly
correctly
what
he
said
remarked
that
few
if
any
of
the
novels
produced
to
day
would
live
as
long
as
the
novels
of
walter
scott
that
may
be
his
notion
maybe
he
is
right
but
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
don't
care
if
they
don't
professor
winchester
also
said
something
about
there
being
no
modern
epics
like
paradise
lost
i
guess
he's
right
he
talked
as
if
he
was
pretty
familiar
with
that
piece
of
literary
work
and
nobody
would
suppose
that
he
never
had
read
it
i
don't
believe
any
of
you
have
ever
read
paradise
lost
and
you
don't
want
to
that's
something
that
you
just
want
to
take
on
trust
it's
a
classic
just
as
professor
winchester
says
and
it
meets
his
definition
of
a
classic
something
that
everybody
wants
to
have
read
and
nobody
wants
to
read
professor
trent
also
had
a
good
deal
to
say
about
the
disappearance
of
literature
he
said
that
scott
would
outlive
all
his
critics
i
guess
that's
true
the
fact
of
the
business
is
you've
got
to
be
one
of
two
ages
to
appreciate
scott
when
you're
eighteen
you
can
read
ivanhoe
and
you
want
to
wait
until
you
are
ninety
to
read
some
of
the
rest
it
takes
a
pretty
well
regulated
abstemious
critic
to
live
ninety
years
but
as
much
as
these
two
gentlemen
have
talked
about
the
disappearance
of
literature
they
didn't
say
anything
about
my
books
maybe
they
think
they've
disappeared
if
they
do
that
just
shows
their
ignorance
on
the
general
subject
of
literature
i
am
not
as
young
as
i
was
several
years
ago
and
maybe
i'm
not
so
fashionable
but
i'd
be
willing
to
take
my
chances
with
mr
scott
to
morrow
morning
in
selling
a
piece
of
literature
to
the
century
publishing
company
and
i
haven't
got
much
of
a
pull
here
either
i
often
think
that
the
highest
compliment
ever
paid
to
my
poor
efforts
was
paid
by
darwin
through
president
eliot
of
harvard
college
at
least
eliot
said
it
was
a
compliment
and
i
always
take
the
opinion
of
great
men
like
college
presidents
on
all
such
subjects
as
that
i
went
out
to
cambridge
one
day
a
few
years
ago
and
called
on
president
eliot
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
he
said
that
he
had
just
returned
from
england
and
that
he
was
very
much
touched
by
what
he
considered
the
high
compliment
darwin
was
paying
to
my
books
and
he
went
on
to
tell
me
something
like
this
do
you
know
that
there
is
one
room
in
darwin's
house
his
bedroom
where
the
housemaid
is
never
allowed
to
touch
two
things
one
is
a
plant
he
is
growing
and
studying
while
it
grows
it
was
one
of
those
insect
devouring
plants
which
consumed
bugs
and
beetles
and
things
for
the
particular
delectation
of
mr
darwin
and
the
other
some
books
that
lie
on
the
night
table
at
the
head
of
his
bed
they
are
your
books
mr
clemens
and
mr
darwin
reads
them
every
night
to
lull
him
to
sleep
my
friends
i
thoroughly
appreciated
that
compliment
and
considered
it
the
highest
one
that
was
ever
paid
to
me
to
be
the
means
of
soothing
to
sleep
a
brain
teeming
with
bugs
and
squirming
things
like
darwin's
was
something
that
i
had
never
hoped
for
and
now
that
he
is
dead
i
never
hope
to
be
able
to
do
it
again

col
william
l
brown
the
former
editor
of
the
daily
news
as
president
of
the
club
introduced
mr
clemens
as
the
principal
ornament
of
american
literature
i
must
say
that
i
have
already
begun
to
regret
that
i
left
my
gun
at
home
i've
said
so
many
times
when
a
chairman
has
distressed
me
with
just
such
compliments
that
the
next
time
such
a
thing
occurs
i
will
certainly
use
a
gun
on
that
chairman
it
is
my
privilege
to
compliment
him
in
return
you
behold
before
you
a
very
very
old
man
a
cursory
glance
at
him
would
deceive
the
most
penetrating
his
features
seem
to
reveal
a
person
dead
to
all
honorable
instincts
they
seem
to
bear
the
traces
of
all
the
known
crimes
instead
of
the
marks
of
a
life
spent
for
the
most
part
and
now
altogether
in
the
sunday
school
of
a
life
that
may
well
stand
as
an
example
to
all
generations
that
have
risen
or
will
riz
i
mean
to
say
will
rise
his
private
character
is
altogether
suggestive
of
virtues
which
to
all
appearances
he
has
not
if
you
examine
his
past
history
you
will
find
it
as
deceptive
as
his
features
because
it
is
marked
all
over
with
waywardness
and
misdemeanor
mere
effects
of
a
great
spirit
upon
a
weak
body
mere
accidents
of
a
great
career
in
his
heart
he
cherishes
every
virtue
on
the
list
of
virtues
and
he
practises
them
all
secretly
always
secretly
you
all
know
him
so
well
that
there
is
no
need
for
him
to
be
introduced
here
gentlemen

simplified

address
at
the
dinner
given
to
mr
carnegie
at
the
dedication
of
the
new
york
engineers
club
december
mr
clemens
was
introduced
by
the
president
of
the
club
who
quoting
from
the
mark
twain
autobiography
recalled
the
day
when
the
distinguished
writer
came
to
new
york
with
in
small
change
in
his
pockets
and
a
bill
sewed
in
his
clothes
it
seems
to
me
that
i
was
around
here
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
public
library
about
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
i
don't
deny
the
circumstance
although
i
don't
see
how
you
got
it
out
of
my
autobiography
which
was
not
to
be
printed
until
i
am
dead
unless
i'm
dead
now
i
had
that
in
change
and
i
remember
well
the
which
was
sewed
in
my
coat
i
have
prospered
since
now
i
have
plenty
of
money
and
a
disposition
to
squander
it
but
i
can't
one
of
those
trust
companies
is
taking
care
of
it
now
as
this
is
probably
the
last
time
that
i
shall
be
out
after
nightfall
this
winter
i
must
say
that
i
have
come
here
with
a
mission
and
i
would
make
my
errand
of
value
many
compliments
have
been
paid
to
mr
carnegie
to
night
i
was
expecting
them
they
are
very
gratifying
to
me
i
have
been
a
guest
of
honor
myself
and
i
know
what
mr
carnegie
is
experiencing
now
it
is
embarrassing
to
get
compliments
and
compliments
and
only
compliments
particularly
when
he
knows
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
that
on
the
other
side
of
him
there
are
all
sorts
of
things
worthy
of
our
condemnation
just
look
at
mr
carnegie's
face
it
is
fairly
scintillating
with
fictitious
innocence
you
would
think
looking
at
him
that
he
had
never
committed
a
crime
in
his
life
but
no
look
at
his
pestiferious
simplified
spelling
you
can't
any
of
you
imagine
what
a
crime
that
has
been
torquemada
was
nothing
to
mr
carnegie
that
old
fellow
shed
some
blood
in
the
inquisition
but
mr
carnegie
has
brought
destruction
to
the
entire
race
i
know
he
didn't
mean
it
to
be
a
crime
but
it
was
just
the
same
he's
got
us
all
so
we
can't
spell
anything
the
trouble
with
him
is
that
he
attacked
orthography
at
the
wrong
end
he
meant
well
but
he
attacked
the
symptoms
and
not
the
cause
of
the
disease
he
ought
to
have
gone
to
work
on
the
alphabet
there's
not
a
vowel
in
it
with
a
definite
value
and
not
a
consonant
that
you
can
hitch
anything
to
look
at
the
h's
distributed
all
around
there's
gherkin
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
h
in
that
what
the
devil's
the
use
of
h
in
gherkin
i'd
like
to
know
it's
one
thing
i
admire
the
english
for
they
just
don't
mind
anything
about
them
at
all
but
look
at
the
pneumatics
and
the
pneumonias
and
the
rest
of
them
a
real
reform
would
settle
them
once
and
for
all
and
wind
up
by
giving
us
an
alphabet
that
we
wouldn't
have
to
spell
with
at
all
instead
of
this
present
silly
alphabet
which
i
fancy
was
invented
by
a
drunken
thief
why
there
isn't
a
man
who
doesn't
have
to
throw
out
about
fifteen
hundred
words
a
day
when
he
writes
his
letters
because
he
can't
spell
them
it's
like
trying
to
do
a
st
vitus's
dance
with
wooden
legs
now
i'll
bet
there
isn't
a
man
here
who
can
spell
pterodactyl
not
even
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
i'd
like
to
hear
him
try
once
but
not
in
public
for
it's
too
near
sunday
when
all
extravagant
histrionic
entertainments
are
barred
i'd
like
to
hear
him
try
in
private
and
when
he
got
through
trying
to
spell
pterodactyl
you
wouldn't
know
whether
it
was
a
fish
or
a
beast
or
a
bird
and
whether
it
flew
on
its
legs
or
walked
with
its
wings
the
chances
are
that
he
would
give
it
tusks
and
make
it
lay
eggs
let's
get
mr
carnegie
to
reform
the
alphabet
and
we'll
pray
for
him
if
he'll
take
the
risk
if
we
had
adequate
competent
vowels
with
a
system
of
accents
giving
to
each
vowel
its
own
soul
and
value
so
every
shade
of
that
vowel
would
be
shown
in
its
accent
there
is
not
a
word
in
any
tongue
that
we
could
not
spell
accurately
that
would
be
competent
adequate
simplified
spelling
in
contrast
to
the
clipping
the
hair
punching
the
carbuncles
and
the
cancers
which
go
by
the
name
of
simplified
spelling
if
i
ask
you
what
b
o
w
spells
you
can't
tell
me
unless
you
know
which
b
o
w
i
mean
and
it
is
the
same
with
r
o
w
b
o
r
e
and
the
whole
family
of
words
which
were
born
out
of
lawful
wedlock
and
don't
know
their
own
origin
now
if
we
had
an
alphabet
that
was
adequate
and
competent
instead
of
inadequate
and
incompetent
things
would
be
different
spelling
reform
has
only
made
it
bald
headed
and
unsightly
there
is
the
whole
tribe
of
them
row
and
read
and
lead
a
whole
family
who
don't
know
who
they
are
i
ask
you
to
pronounce
s
o
w
and
you
ask
me
what
kind
of
a
one
if
we
had
a
sane
determinate
alphabet
instead
of
a
hospital
of
comminuted
eunuchs
you
would
know
whether
one
referred
to
the
act
of
a
man
casting
the
seed
over
the
ploughed
land
or
whether
one
wished
to
recall
the
lady
hog
and
the
future
ham
it's
a
rotten
alphabet
i
appoint
mr
carnegie
to
get
after
it
and
leave
simplified
spelling
alone
simplified
spelling
brought
about
sun
spots
the
san
francisco
earthquake
and
the
recent
business
depression
which
we
would
never
have
had
if
spelling
had
been
left
all
alone
now
i
hope
i
have
soothed
mr
carnegie
and
made
him
more
comfortable
than
he
would
have
been
had
he
received
only
compliment
after
compliment
and
i
wish
to
say
to
him
that
simplified
spelling
is
all
right
but
like
chastity
you
can
carry
it
too
far
spelling
and
pictures
address
at
the
annual
dinner
of
the
associated
press
at
the
waldorf
astoria
september
i
am
here
to
make
an
appeal
to
the
nations
in
behalf
of
the
simplified
spelling
i
have
come
here
because
they
cannot
all
be
reached
except
through
you
there
are
only
two
forces
that
can
carry
light
to
all
the
corners
of
the
globe
only
two
the
sun
in
the
heavens
and
the
associated
press
down
here
i
may
seem
to
be
flattering
the
sun
but
i
do
not
mean
it
so
i
am
meaning
only
to
be
just
and
fair
all
around
you
speak
with
a
million
voices
no
one
can
reach
so
many
races
so
many
hearts
and
intellects
as
you
except
rudyard
kipling
and
he
cannot
do
it
without
your
help
if
the
associated
press
will
adopt
and
use
our
simplified
forms
and
thus
spread
them
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
covering
the
whole
spacious
planet
with
them
as
with
a
garden
of
flowers
our
difficulties
are
at
an
end
every
day
of
the
three
hundred
and
sixty
five
the
only
pages
of
the
world's
countless
newspapers
that
are
read
by
all
the
human
beings
and
angels
and
devils
that
can
read
are
these
pages
that
are
built
out
of
associated
press
despatches
and
so
i
beg
you
i
beseech
you
oh
i
implore
you
to
spell
them
in
our
simplified
forms
do
this
daily
constantly
persistently
for
three
months
only
three
months
it
is
all
i
ask
the
infallible
result
victory
victory
all
down
the
line
for
by
that
time
all
eyes
here
and
above
and
below
will
have
become
adjusted
to
the
change
and
in
love
with
it
and
the
present
clumsy
and
ragged
forms
will
be
grotesque
to
the
eye
and
revolting
to
the
soul
and
we
shall
be
rid
of
phthisis
and
phthisic
and
pneumonia
and
pneumatics
and
diphtheria
and
pterodactyl
and
all
those
other
insane
words
which
no
man
addicted
to
the
simple
christian
life
can
try
to
spell
and
not
lose
some
of
the
bloom
of
his
piety
in
the
demoralizing
attempt
do
not
doubt
it
we
are
chameleons
and
our
partialities
and
prejudices
change
places
with
an
easy
and
blessed
facility
and
we
are
soon
wonted
to
the
change
and
happy
in
it
we
do
not
regret
our
old
yellow
fangs
and
snags
and
tushes
after
we
have
worn
nice
fresh
uniform
store
teeth
a
while
do
i
seem
to
be
seeking
the
good
of
the
world
that
is
the
idea
it
is
my
public
attitude
privately
i
am
merely
seeking
my
own
profit
we
all
do
it
but
it
is
sound
and
it
is
virtuous
for
no
public
interest
is
anything
other
or
nobler
than
a
massed
accumulation
of
private
interests
in
when
the
simplified
spelling
movement
first
tried
to
make
a
noise
i
was
indifferent
to
it
more
i
even
irreverently
scoffed
at
it
what
i
needed
was
an
object
lesson
you
see
it
is
the
only
way
to
teach
some
people
very
well
i
got
it
at
that
time
i
was
scrambling
along
earning
the
family's
bread
on
magazine
work
at
seven
cents
a
word
compound
words
at
single
rates
just
as
it
is
in
the
dark
present
i
was
the
property
of
a
magazine
a
seven
cent
slave
under
a
boiler
iron
contract
one
day
there
came
a
note
from
the
editor
requiring
me
to
write
ten
pages
on
this
revolting
text
considerations
concerning
the
alleged
subterranean
holophotal
extemporaneousness
of
the
conchyliaceous
superimbrication
of
the
ornithorhyncus
as
foreshadowed
by
the
unintelligibility
of
its
plesiosaurian
anisodactylous
aspects
ten
pages
of
that
each
and
every
word
a
seventeen
jointed
vestibuled
railroad
train
seven
cents
a
word
i
saw
starvation
staring
the
family
in
the
face
i
went
to
the
editor
and
i
took
a
stenographer
along
so
as
to
have
the
interview
down
in
black
and
white
for
no
magazine
editor
can
ever
remember
any
part
of
a
business
talk
except
the
part
that's
got
graft
in
it
for
him
and
the
magazine
i
said
read
that
text
jackson
and
let
it
go
on
the
record
read
it
out
loud
he
read
it
considerations
concerning
the
alleged
subterranean
holophotal
extemporaneousness
of
the
conchyliaceous
superimbrication
of
the
ornithorhyncus
as
foreshadowed
by
the
unintelligibility
of
its
plesiosaurian
anisodactylous
aspects
i
said
you
want
ten
pages
of
those
rumbling
great
long
summer
thunderpeals
and
you
expect
to
get
them
at
seven
cents
a
peal
he
said
a
word's
a
word
and
seven
cents
is
the
contract
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
i
said
jackson
this
is
cold
blooded
oppression
what's
an
average
english
word
he
said
six
letters
i
said
nothing
of
the
kind
that's
french
and
includes
the
spaces
between
the
words
an
average
english
word
is
four
letters
and
a
half
by
hard
honest
labor
i've
dug
all
the
large
words
out
of
my
vocabulary
and
shaved
it
down
till
the
average
is
three
letters
and
a
half
i
can
put
one
thousand
and
two
hundred
words
on
your
page
and
there's
not
another
man
alive
that
can
come
within
two
hundred
of
it
my
page
is
worth
eighty
four
dollars
to
me
it
takes
exactly
as
long
to
fill
your
magazine
page
with
long
words
as
it
does
with
short
ones
four
hours
now
then
look
at
the
criminal
injustice
of
this
requirement
of
yours
i
am
careful
i
am
economical
of
my
time
and
labor
for
the
family's
sake
i've
got
to
be
so
so
i
never
write
metropolis
for
seven
cents
because
i
can
get
the
same
money
for
city
i
never
write
policeman
because
i
can
get
the
same
price
for
cop
and
so
on
and
so
on
i
never
write
valetudinarian
at
all
for
not
even
hunger
and
wretchedness
can
humble
me
to
the
point
where
i
will
do
a
word
like
that
for
seven
cents
i
wouldn't
do
it
for
fifteen
examine
your
obscene
text
please
count
the
words
he
counted
and
said
it
was
twenty
four
i
asked
him
to
count
the
letters
he
made
it
two
hundred
and
three
i
said
now
i
hope
you
see
the
whole
size
of
your
crime
with
my
vocabulary
i
would
make
sixty
words
out
of
those
two
hundred
and
five
letters
and
get
four
dollars
and
twenty
cents
for
it
whereas
for
your
inhuman
twenty
four
i
would
get
only
one
dollar
and
sixty
eight
cents
ten
pages
of
these
sky
scrapers
of
yours
would
pay
me
only
about
three
hundred
dollars
in
my
simplified
vocabulary
the
same
space
and
the
same
labor
would
pay
me
eight
hundred
and
forty
dollars
i
do
not
wish
to
work
upon
this
scandalous
job
by
the
piece
i
want
to
be
hired
by
the
year
he
coldly
refused
i
said
then
for
the
sake
of
the
family
if
you
have
no
feeling
for
me
you
ought
at
least
to
allow
me
overtime
on
that
word
extemporaneousness
again
he
coldly
refused
i
seldom
say
a
harsh
word
to
any
one
but
i
was
not
master
of
myself
then
and
i
spoke
right
out
and
called
him
an
anisodactylous
plesiosaurian
conchyliaceous
ornithorhyncus
and
rotten
to
the
heart
with
holoaophotal
subterranean
extemporaneousness
god
forgive
me
for
that
wanton
crime
he
lived
only
two
hours
from
that
day
to
this
i
have
been
a
devoted
and
hard
working
member
of
the
heaven
born
institution
the
international
association
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
authors
and
now
i
am
laboring
with
carnegie's
simplified
committee
and
with
my
heart
in
the
work
now
then
let
us
look
at
this
mighty
question
reasonably
rationally
sanely
yes
and
calmly
not
excitedly
what
is
the
real
function
the
essential
function
the
supreme
function
of
language
isn't
it
merely
to
convey
ideas
and
emotions
certainly
then
if
we
can
do
it
with
words
of
fonetic
brevity
and
compactness
why
keep
the
present
cumbersome
forms
but
can
we
yes
i
hold
in
my
hand
the
proof
of
it
here
is
a
letter
written
by
a
woman
right
out
of
her
heart
of
hearts
i
think
she
never
saw
a
spelling
book
in
her
life
the
spelling
is
her
own
there
isn't
a
waste
letter
in
it
anywhere
it
reduces
the
fonetics
to
the
last
gasp
it
squeezes
the
surplusage
out
of
every
word
there's
no
spelling
that
can
begin
with
it
on
this
planet
outside
of
the
white
house
and
as
for
the
punctuation
there
isn't
any
it
is
all
one
sentence
eagerly
and
breathlessly
uttered
without
break
or
pause
in
it
anywhere
the
letter
is
absolutely
genuine
i
have
the
proofs
of
that
in
my
possession
i
can't
stop
to
spell
the
words
for
you
but
you
can
take
the
letter
presently
and
comfort
your
eyes
with
it
i
will
read
the
letter
miss
dear
freind
i
took
some
close
into
the
armerry
and
give
them
to
you
to
send
too
the
suffrers
out
to
california
and
i
hate
to
treble
you
but
i
got
to
have
one
of
them
back
it
was
a
black
oll
wolle
shevyott
with
a
jacket
to
mach
trimed
kind
of
fancy
no
burst
measure
and
palsy
menterry
acrost
the
front
and
the
color
i
woodent
trubble
you
but
it
belonged
to
my
brothers
wife
and
she
is
mad
about
it
i
thoght
she
was
willin
but
she
want
she
says
she
want
done
with
it
and
she
was
going
to
wear
it
a
spell
longer
she
ant
so
free
harted
as
what
i
am
and
she
has
got
more
to
do
with
than
i
have
having
a
husband
to
work
and
slave
for
her
i
gels
you
remember
me
i
am
shot
and
stout
and
light
complected
i
torked
with
you
quite
a
spell
about
the
suffrars
and
said
it
was
orful
about
that
erth
quake
i
shoodent
wondar
if
they
had
another
one
rite
off
seeine
general
condision
of
the
country
is
kind
of
explossive
i
hate
to
take
that
black
dress
away
from
the
suffrars
but
i
will
hunt
round
and
see
if
i
can
get
another
one
if
i
can
i
will
call
to
the
armerry
for
it
if
you
will
jest
lay
it
asside
so
no
more
at
present
from
your
true
freind
i
liked
your
appearance
very
much
now
you
see
what
simplified
spelling
can
do
it
can
convey
any
fact
you
need
to
convey
and
it
can
pour
out
emotions
like
a
sewer
i
beg
you
i
beseech
you
to
adopt
our
spelling
and
print
all
your
despatches
in
it
now
i
wish
to
say
just
one
entirely
serious
word
i
have
reached
a
time
of
life
seventy
years
and
a
half
where
none
of
the
concerns
of
this
world
have
much
interest
for
me
personally
i
think
i
can
speak
dispassionately
upon
this
matter
because
in
the
little
while
that
i
have
got
to
remain
here
i
can
get
along
very
well
with
these
old
fashioned
forms
and
i
don't
propose
to
make
any
trouble
about
it
at
all
i
shall
soon
be
where
they
won't
care
how
i
spell
so
long
as
i
keep
the
sabbath
there
are
eighty
two
millions
of
us
people
that
use
this
orthography
and
it
ought
to
be
simplified
in
our
behalf
but
it
is
kept
in
its
present
condition
to
satisfy
one
million
people
who
like
to
have
their
literature
in
the
old
form
that
looks
to
me
to
be
rather
selfish
and
we
keep
the
forms
as
they
are
while
we
have
got
one
million
people
coming
in
here
from
foreign
countries
every
year
and
they
have
got
to
struggle
with
this
orthography
of
ours
and
it
keeps
them
back
and
damages
their
citizenship
for
years
until
they
learn
to
spell
the
language
if
they
ever
do
learn
this
is
merely
sentimental
argument
people
say
it
is
the
spelling
of
chaucer
and
spencer
and
shakespeare
and
a
lot
of
other
people
who
do
not
know
how
to
spell
anyway
and
it
has
been
transmitted
to
us
and
we
preserved
it
and
wish
to
preserve
it
because
of
its
ancient
and
hallowed
associations
now
i
don't
see
that
there
is
any
real
argument
about
that
if
that
argument
is
good
then
it
would
be
a
good
argument
not
to
banish
the
flies
and
the
cockroaches
from
hospitals
because
they
have
been
there
so
long
that
the
patients
have
got
used
to
them
and
they
feel
a
tenderness
for
them
on
account
of
the
associations
why
it
is
like
preserving
a
cancer
in
a
family
because
it
is
a
family
cancer
and
we
are
bound
to
it
by
the
test
of
affection
and
reverence
and
old
mouldy
antiquity
i
think
that
this
declaration
to
improve
this
orthography
of
ours
is
our
family
cancer
and
i
wish
we
could
reconcile
ourselves
to
have
it
cut
out
and
let
the
family
cancer
go
now
you
see
before
you
the
wreck
and
ruin
of
what
was
once
a
young
person
like
yourselves
i
am
exhausted
by
the
heat
of
the
day
i
must
take
what
is
left
of
this
wreck
and
run
out
of
your
presence
and
carry
it
away
to
my
home
and
spread
it
out
there
and
sleep
the
sleep
of
the
righteous
there
is
nothing
much
left
of
me
but
my
age
and
my
righteousness
but
i
leave
with
you
my
love
and
my
blessing
and
may
you
always
keep
your
youth
books
and
burglars
address
to
the
redding
conn
library
association
october
suppose
this
library
had
been
in
operation
a
few
weeks
ago
and
the
burglars
who
happened
along
and
broke
into
my
house
taking
a
lot
of
things
they
didn't
need
and
for
that
matter
which
i
didn't
need
had
first
made
entry
into
this
institution
picture
them
seated
here
on
the
floor
poring
by
the
light
of
their
dark
lanterns
over
some
of
the
books
they
found
and
thus
absorbing
moral
truths
and
getting
a
moral
uplift
the
whole
course
of
their
lives
would
have
been
changed
as
it
was
they
kept
straight
on
in
their
immoral
way
and
were
sent
to
jail
for
all
we
know
they
may
next
be
sent
to
congress
and
speaking
of
burglars
let
us
not
speak
of
them
too
harshly
now
i
have
known
so
many
burglars
not
exactly
known
but
so
many
of
them
have
come
near
me
in
my
various
dwelling
places
that
i
am
disposed
to
allow
them
credit
for
whatever
good
qualities
they
possess
chief
among
these
and
indeed
the
only
one
i
just
now
think
of
is
their
great
care
while
doing
business
to
avoid
disturbing
people's
sleep
noiseless
as
they
may
be
while
at
work
however
the
effect
of
their
visitation
is
to
murder
sleep
later
on
now
we
are
prepared
for
these
visitors
all
sorts
of
alarm
devices
have
been
put
in
the
house
and
the
ground
for
half
a
mile
around
it
has
been
electrified
the
burglar
who
steps
within
this
danger
zone
will
set
loose
a
bedlam
of
sounds
and
spring
into
readiness
for
action
our
elaborate
system
of
defences
as
for
the
fate
of
the
trespasser
do
not
seek
to
know
that
he
will
never
be
heard
of
more
authors
club
address
at
the
dinner
given
in
honor
of
mr
clemens
london
june
mr
clemens
was
introduced
by
sir
walter
besant
it
does
not
embarrass
me
to
hear
my
books
praised
so
much
it
only
pleases
and
delights
me
i
have
not
gone
beyond
the
age
when
embarrassment
is
possible
but
i
have
reached
the
age
when
i
know
how
to
conceal
it
it
is
such
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
hear
sir
walter
besant
who
is
much
more
capable
than
i
to
judge
of
my
work
deliver
a
judgment
which
is
such
a
contentment
to
my
spirit
well
i
have
thought
well
of
the
books
myself
but
i
think
more
of
them
now
it
charms
me
also
to
hear
sir
spencer
walpole
deliver
a
similar
judgment
and
i
shall
treasure
his
remarks
also
i
shall
not
discount
the
praises
in
any
possible
way
when
i
report
them
to
my
family
they
shall
lose
nothing
there
are
however
certain
heredities
which
come
down
to
us
which
our
writings
of
the
present
day
may
be
traced
to
i
for
instance
read
the
walpole
letters
when
i
was
a
boy
i
absorbed
them
gathered
in
their
grace
wit
and
humor
and
put
them
away
to
be
used
by
and
by
one
does
that
so
unconsciously
with
things
one
really
likes
i
am
reminded
now
of
what
use
those
letters
have
been
to
me
they
must
not
claim
credit
in
america
for
what
was
really
written
in
another
form
so
long
ago
they
must
only
claim
that
i
trimmed
this
that
and
the
other
and
so
changed
their
appearance
as
to
make
them
seem
to
be
original
you
now
see
what
modesty
i
have
in
stock
but
it
has
taken
long
practice
to
get
it
there
but
i
must
not
stand
here
talking
i
merely
meant
to
get
up
and
give
my
thanks
for
the
pleasant
things
that
preceding
speakers
have
said
of
me
i
wish
also
to
extend
my
thanks
to
the
authors
club
for
constituting
me
a
member
at
a
reasonable
price
per
year
and
for
giving
me
the
benefit
of
your
legal
adviser
i
believe
you
keep
a
lawyer
i
have
always
kept
a
lawyer
too
though
i
have
never
made
anything
out
of
him
it
is
service
to
an
author
to
have
a
lawyer
there
is
something
so
disagreeable
in
having
a
personal
contact
with
a
publisher
so
it
is
better
to
work
through
a
lawyer
and
lose
your
case
i
understand
that
the
publishers
have
been
meeting
together
also
like
us
i
don't
know
what
for
but
possibly
they
are
devising
new
and
mysterious
ways
for
remunerating
authors
i
only
wish
now
to
thank
you
for
electing
me
a
member
of
this
club
i
believe
i
have
paid
my
dues
and
to
thank
you
again
for
the
pleasant
things
you
have
said
of
me
last
february
when
rudyard
kipling
was
ill
in
america
the
sympathy
which
was
poured
out
to
him
was
genuine
and
sincere
and
i
believe
that
which
cost
kipling
so
much
will
bring
england
and
america
closer
together
i
have
been
proud
and
pleased
to
see
this
growing
affection
and
respect
between
the
two
countries
i
hope
it
will
continue
to
grow
and
please
god
it
will
continue
to
grow
i
trust
we
authors
will
leave
to
posterity
if
we
have
nothing
else
to
leave
a
friendship
between
england
and
america
that
will
count
for
much
i
will
now
confess
that
i
have
been
engaged
for
the
past
eight
days
in
compiling
a
publication
i
have
brought
it
here
to
lay
at
your
feet
i
do
not
ask
your
indulgence
in
presenting
it
but
for
your
applause
here
it
is
since
england
and
america
may
be
joined
together
in
kipling
may
they
not
be
severed
in
twain
booksellers
address
at
banquet
on
wednesday
evening
may
of
the
american
booksellers
association
which
included
most
of
the
leading
booksellers
of
america
held
at
the
rooms
of
the
aldine
association
new
york
this
annual
gathering
of
booksellers
from
all
over
america
comes
together
ostensibly
to
eat
and
drink
but
really
to
discuss
business
therefore
i
am
required
to
talk
shop
i
am
required
to
furnish
a
statement
of
the
indebtedness
under
which
i
lie
to
you
gentlemen
for
your
help
in
enabling
me
to
earn
my
living
for
something
over
forty
years
i
have
acquired
my
bread
by
print
beginning
with
the
innocents
abroad
followed
at
intervals
of
a
year
or
so
by
roughing
it
tom
sawyer
gilded
age
and
so
on
for
thirty
six
years
my
books
were
sold
by
subscription
you
are
not
interested
in
those
years
but
only
in
the
four
which
have
since
followed
the
books
passed
into
the
hands
of
my
present
publishers
at
the
beginning
of
and
you
then
became
the
providers
of
my
diet
i
think
i
may
say
without
flattering
you
that
you
have
done
exceedingly
well
by
me
exceedingly
well
is
not
too
strong
a
phrase
since
the
official
statistics
show
that
in
four
years
you
have
sold
twice
as
many
volumes
of
my
venerable
books
as
my
contract
with
my
publishers
bound
you
and
them
to
sell
in
five
years
to
your
sorrow
you
are
aware
that
frequently
much
too
frequently
when
a
book
gets
to
be
five
or
ten
years
old
its
annual
sale
shrinks
to
two
or
three
hundred
copies
and
after
an
added
ten
or
twenty
years
ceases
to
sell
but
you
sell
thousands
of
my
moss
backed
old
books
every
year
the
youngest
of
them
being
books
that
range
from
fifteen
to
twenty
seven
years
old
and
the
oldest
reaching
back
to
thirty
five
and
forty
by
the
terms
of
my
contract
my
publishers
had
to
account
to
me
for
volumes
per
year
for
five
years
and
pay
me
for
them
whether
they
sold
them
or
not
it
is
at
this
point
that
you
gentlemen
come
in
for
it
was
your
business
to
unload
volumes
upon
the
public
in
five
years
if
you
possibly
could
have
you
succeeded
yes
you
have
and
more
for
in
four
years
with
a
year
still
to
spare
you
have
sold
the
volumes
and
besides
your
sales
have
increased
each
year
in
the
first
year
you
sold
in
the
second
year
in
the
third
in
the
fourth
year
which
was
last
year
you
sold
the
aggregate
for
the
four
years
is
volumes
lacking
of
the
oldest
book
the
innocents
abroad
now
forty
years
old
you
sold
upward
of
copies
in
the
four
years
of
roughing
it
now
thirty
eight
years
old
i
think
you
sold
of
tom
sawyer
and
so
on
and
there
is
one
thing
that
is
peculiarly
gratifying
to
me
the
personal
recollections
of
joan
of
arc
is
a
serious
book
i
wrote
it
for
love
and
never
expected
it
to
sell
but
you
have
pleasantly
disappointed
me
in
that
matter
in
your
hands
its
sale
has
increased
each
year
in
you
sold
copies
in
in
and
last
year
mark
twain's
first
appearance
on
october
mr
clemens
following
a
musical
recital
by
his
daughter
in
norfolk
conn
addressed
her
audience
on
the
subject
of
stage
fright
he
thanked
the
people
for
making
things
as
easy
as
possible
for
his
daughter's
american
debut
as
a
contralto
and
then
told
of
his
first
experience
before
the
public
my
heart
goes
out
in
sympathy
to
any
one
who
is
making
his
first
appearance
before
an
audience
of
human
beings
by
a
direct
process
of
memory
i
go
back
forty
years
less
one
month
for
i'm
older
than
i
look
i
recall
the
occasion
of
my
first
appearance
san
francisco
knew
me
then
only
as
a
reporter
and
i
was
to
make
my
bow
to
san
francisco
as
a
lecturer
i
knew
that
nothing
short
of
compulsion
would
get
me
to
the
theatre
so
i
bound
myself
by
a
hard
and
fast
contract
so
that
i
could
not
escape
i
got
to
the
theatre
forty
five
minutes
before
the
hour
set
for
the
lecture
my
knees
were
shaking
so
that
i
didn't
know
whether
i
could
stand
up
if
there
is
an
awful
horrible
malady
in
the
world
it
is
stage
fright
and
seasickness
they
are
a
pair
i
had
stage
fright
then
for
the
first
and
last
time
i
was
only
seasick
once
too
it
was
on
a
little
ship
on
which
there
were
two
hundred
other
passengers
i
was
sick
i
was
so
sick
that
there
wasn't
any
left
for
those
other
two
hundred
passengers
it
was
dark
and
lonely
behind
the
scenes
in
that
theatre
and
i
peeked
through
the
little
peekholes
they
have
in
theatre
curtains
and
looked
into
the
big
auditorium
that
was
dark
and
empty
too
by
and
by
it
lighted
up
and
the
audience
began
to
arrive
i
had
got
a
number
of
friends
of
mine
stalwart
men
to
sprinkle
themselves
through
the
audience
armed
with
big
clubs
every
time
i
said
anything
they
could
possibly
guess
i
intended
to
be
funny
they
were
to
pound
those
clubs
on
the
floor
then
there
was
a
kind
lady
in
a
box
up
there
also
a
good
friend
of
mine
the
wife
of
the
governor
she
was
to
watch
me
intently
and
whenever
i
glanced
toward
her
she
was
going
to
deliver
a
gubernatorial
laugh
that
would
lead
the
whole
audience
into
applause
at
last
i
began
i
had
the
manuscript
tucked
under
a
united
states
flag
in
front
of
me
where
i
could
get
at
it
in
case
of
need
but
i
managed
to
get
started
without
it
i
walked
up
and
down
i
was
young
in
those
days
and
needed
the
exercise
and
talked
and
talked
right
in
the
middle
of
the
speech
i
had
placed
a
gem
i
had
put
in
a
moving
pathetic
part
which
was
to
get
at
the
hearts
and
souls
of
my
hearers
when
i
delivered
it
they
did
just
what
i
hoped
and
expected
they
sat
silent
and
awed
i
had
touched
them
then
i
happened
to
glance
up
at
the
box
where
the
governor's
wife
was
you
know
what
happened
well
after
the
first
agonizing
five
minutes
my
stage
fright
left
me
never
to
return
i
know
if
i
was
going
to
be
hanged
i
could
get
up
and
make
a
good
showing
and
i
intend
to
but
i
shall
never
forget
my
feelings
before
the
agony
left
me
and
i
got
up
here
to
thank
you
for
her
for
helping
my
daughter
by
your
kindness
to
live
through
her
first
appearance
and
i
want
to
thank
you
for
your
appreciation
of
her
singing
which
is
by
the
way
hereditary
morals
and
memory
mr
clemens
was
the
guest
of
honor
at
a
reception
held
at
barnard
college
columbia
university
march
by
the
barnard
union
one
of
the
young
ladies
presented
mr
clemens
and
thanked
him
for
his
amiability
in
coming
to
make
them
an
address
she
closed
with
the
expression
of
the
great
joy
it
gave
her
fellow
collegians
because
we
all
love
you
if
any
one
here
loves
me
she
has
my
sincere
thanks
nay
if
any
one
here
is
so
good
as
to
love
me
why
i'll
be
a
brother
to
her
she
shall
have
my
sincere
warm
unsullied
affection
when
i
was
coming
up
in
the
car
with
the
very
kind
young
lady
who
was
delegated
to
show
me
the
way
she
asked
me
what
i
was
going
to
talk
about
and
i
said
i
wasn't
sure
i
said
i
had
some
illustrations
and
i
was
going
to
bring
them
in
i
said
i
was
certain
to
give
those
illustrations
but
that
i
hadn't
the
faintest
notion
what
they
were
going
to
illustrate
now
i've
been
thinking
it
over
in
this
forest
glade
the
woods
of
arcady
on
the
scene
and
i've
decided
to
work
them
in
with
something
about
morals
and
the
caprices
of
memory
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
pretty
good
subject
you
see
everybody
has
a
memory
and
it's
pretty
sure
to
have
caprices
and
of
course
everybody
has
morals
it's
my
opinion
that
every
one
i
know
has
morals
though
i
wouldn't
like
to
ask
i
know
i
have
but
i'd
rather
teach
them
than
practice
them
any
day
give
them
to
others
that's
my
motto
then
you
never
have
any
use
for
them
when
you're
left
without
now
speaking
of
the
caprices
of
memory
in
general
and
of
mine
in
particular
it's
strange
to
think
of
all
the
tricks
this
little
mental
process
plays
on
us
here
we're
endowed
with
a
faculty
of
mind
that
ought
to
be
more
supremely
serviceable
to
us
than
them
all
and
what
happens
this
memory
of
ours
stores
up
a
perfect
record
of
the
most
useless
facts
and
anecdotes
and
experiences
and
all
the
things
that
we
ought
to
know
that
we
need
to
know
that
we'd
profit
by
knowing
it
casts
aside
with
the
careless
indifference
of
a
girl
refusing
her
true
lover
it's
terrible
to
think
of
this
phenomenon
i
tremble
in
all
my
members
when
i
consider
all
the
really
valuable
things
that
i've
forgotten
in
seventy
years
when
i
meditate
upon
the
caprices
of
my
memory
there's
a
bird
out
in
california
that
is
one
perfect
symbol
of
the
human
memory
i've
forgotten
the
bird's
name
just
because
it
would
be
valuable
for
me
to
know
it
to
recall
it
to
your
own
minds
perhaps
but
this
fool
of
a
creature
goes
around
collecting
the
most
ridiculous
things
you
can
imagine
and
storing
them
up
he
never
selects
a
thing
that
could
ever
prove
of
the
slightest
help
to
him
but
he
goes
about
gathering
iron
forks
and
spoons
and
tin
cans
and
broken
mouse
traps
all
sorts
of
rubbish
that
is
difficult
for
him
to
carry
and
yet
be
any
use
when
he
gets
it
why
that
bird
will
go
by
a
gold
watch
to
bring
back
one
of
those
patent
cake
pans
now
my
mind
is
just
like
that
and
my
mind
isn't
very
different
from
yours
and
so
our
minds
are
just
like
that
bird
we
pass
by
what
would
be
of
inestimable
value
to
us
and
pack
our
memories
with
the
most
trivial
odds
and
ends
that
never
by
any
chance
under
any
circumstances
whatsoever
could
be
of
the
slightest
use
to
any
one
now
things
that
i
have
remembered
are
constantly
popping
into
my
head
and
i
am
repeatedly
startled
by
the
vividness
with
which
they
recur
to
me
after
the
lapse
of
years
and
their
utter
uselessness
in
being
remembered
at
all
i
was
thinking
over
some
on
my
way
up
here
they
were
the
illustrations
i
spoke
about
to
the
young
lady
on
the
way
up
and
i've
come
to
the
conclusion
curious
though
it
is
that
i
can
use
every
one
of
these
freaks
of
memory
to
teach
you
all
a
lesson
i'm
convinced
that
each
one
has
its
moral
and
i
think
it's
my
duty
to
hand
the
moral
on
to
you
now
i
recall
that
when
i
was
a
boy
i
was
a
good
boy
i
was
a
very
good
boy
why
i
was
the
best
boy
in
my
school
i
was
the
best
boy
in
that
little
mississippi
town
where
i
lived
the
population
was
only
about
twenty
million
you
may
not
believe
it
but
i
was
the
best
boy
in
that
state
and
in
the
united
states
for
that
matter
but
i
don't
know
why
i
never
heard
any
one
say
that
but
myself
i
always
recognized
it
but
even
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
me
couldn't
seem
to
see
it
my
mother
especially
seemed
to
think
there
was
something
wrong
with
that
estimate
and
she
never
got
over
that
prejudice
now
when
my
mother
got
to
be
eighty
five
years
old
her
memory
failed
her
she
forgot
little
threads
that
hold
life's
patches
of
meaning
together
she
was
living
out
west
then
and
i
went
on
to
visit
her
i
hadn't
seen
my
mother
in
a
year
or
so
and
when
i
got
there
she
knew
my
face
knew
i
was
married
knew
i
had
a
family
and
that
i
was
living
with
them
but
she
couldn't
for
the
life
of
her
tell
my
name
or
who
i
was
so
i
told
her
i
was
her
boy
but
you
don't
live
with
me
she
said
no
said
i
i'm
living
in
rochester
what
are
you
doing
there
going
to
school
large
school
very
large
all
boys
all
boys
and
how
do
you
stand
said
my
mother
i'm
the
best
boy
in
that
school
i
answered
well
said
my
mother
with
a
return
of
her
old
fire
i'd
like
to
know
what
the
other
boys
are
like
now
one
point
in
this
story
is
the
fact
that
my
mother's
mind
went
back
to
my
school
days
and
remembered
my
little
youthful
self
prejudice
when
she'd
forgotten
everything
else
about
me
the
other
point
is
the
moral
there's
one
there
that
you
will
find
if
you
search
for
it
now
here's
something
else
i
remember
it's
about
the
first
time
i
ever
stole
a
watermelon
stole
is
a
strong
word
stole
stole
no
i
don't
mean
that
it
was
the
first
time
i
ever
withdrew
a
watermelon
it
was
the
first
time
i
ever
extracted
a
watermelon
that
is
exactly
the
word
i
want
extracted
it
is
definite
it
is
precise
it
perfectly
conveys
my
idea
its
use
in
dentistry
connotes
the
delicate
shade
of
meaning
i
am
looking
for
you
know
we
never
extract
our
own
teeth
and
it
was
not
my
watermelon
that
i
extracted
i
extracted
that
watermelon
from
a
farmer's
wagon
while
he
was
inside
negotiating
with
another
customer
i
carried
that
watermelon
to
one
of
the
secluded
recesses
of
the
lumber
yard
and
there
i
broke
it
open
it
was
a
green
watermelon
well
do
you
know
when
i
saw
that
i
began
to
feel
sorry
sorry
sorry
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
done
wrong
i
reflected
deeply
i
reflected
that
i
was
young
i
think
i
was
just
eleven
but
i
knew
that
though
immature
i
did
not
lack
moral
advancement
i
knew
what
a
boy
ought
to
do
who
had
extracted
a
watermelon
like
that
i
considered
george
washington
and
what
action
he
would
have
taken
under
similar
circumstances
then
i
knew
there
was
just
one
thing
to
make
me
feel
right
inside
and
that
was
restitution
so
i
said
to
myself
i
will
do
that
i
will
take
that
green
watermelon
back
where
i
got
it
from
and
the
minute
i
had
said
it
i
felt
that
great
moral
uplift
that
comes
to
you
when
you've
made
a
noble
resolution
so
i
gathered
up
the
biggest
fragments
and
i
carried
them
back
to
the
farmer's
wagon
and
i
restored
the
watermelon
what
was
left
of
it
and
i
made
him
give
me
a
good
one
in
place
of
it
too
and
i
told
him
he
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
going
around
working
off
his
worthless
old
green
watermelons
on
trusting
purchasers
who
had
to
rely
on
him
how
could
they
tell
from
the
outside
whether
the
melons
were
good
or
not
that
was
his
business
and
if
he
didn't
reform
i
told
him
i'd
see
that
he
didn't
get
any
more
of
my
trade
nor
anybody
else's
i
knew
if
i
could
help
it
you
know
that
man
was
as
contrite
as
a
revivalist's
last
convert
he
said
he
was
all
broken
up
to
think
i'd
gotten
a
green
watermelon
he
promised
that
he
would
never
carry
another
green
watermelon
if
he
starved
for
it
and
he
drove
off
a
better
man
now
do
you
see
what
i
did
for
that
man
he
was
on
a
downward
path
and
i
rescued
him
but
all
i
got
out
of
it
was
a
watermelon
yet
i'd
rather
have
that
memory
just
that
memory
of
the
good
i
did
for
that
depraved
farmer
than
all
the
material
gain
you
can
think
of
look
at
the
lesson
he
got
i
never
got
anything
like
that
from
it
but
i
ought
to
be
satisfied
i
was
only
eleven
years
old
but
i
secured
everlasting
benefit
to
other
people
the
moral
in
this
is
perfectly
clear
and
i
think
there's
one
in
the
next
memory
i'm
going
to
tell
you
about
to
go
back
to
my
childhood
there's
another
little
incident
that
comes
to
me
from
which
you
can
draw
even
another
moral
it's
about
one
of
the
times
i
went
fishing
you
see
in
our
house
there
was
a
sort
of
family
prejudice
against
going
fishing
if
you
hadn't
permission
but
it
would
frequently
be
bad
judgment
to
ask
so
i
went
fishing
secretly
as
it
were
way
up
the
mississippi
it
was
an
exquisitely
happy
trip
i
recall
with
a
very
pleasant
sensation
well
while
i
was
away
there
was
a
tragedy
in
our
town
a
stranger
stopping
over
on
his
way
east
from
california
was
stabbed
to
death
in
an
unseemly
brawl
now
my
father
was
justice
of
the
peace
and
because
he
was
justice
of
the
peace
he
was
coroner
and
since
he
was
coroner
he
was
also
constable
and
being
constable
he
was
sheriff
and
out
of
consideration
for
his
holding
the
office
of
sheriff
he
was
likewise
county
clerk
and
a
dozen
other
officials
i
don't
think
of
just
this
minute
i
thought
he
had
power
of
life
or
death
only
he
didn't
use
it
over
other
boys
he
was
sort
of
an
austere
man
somehow
i
didn't
like
being
round
him
when
i'd
done
anything
he
disapproved
of
so
that's
the
reason
i
wasn't
often
around
well
when
this
gentleman
got
knifed
they
communicated
with
the
proper
authority
the
coroner
and
they
laid
the
corpse
out
in
the
coroner's
office
our
front
sitting
room
in
preparation
for
the
inquest
the
next
morning
about
or
o'clock
i
got
back
from
fishing
it
was
a
little
too
late
for
me
to
be
received
by
my
folks
so
i
took
my
shoes
off
and
slipped
noiselessly
up
the
back
way
to
the
sitting
room
i
was
very
tired
and
i
didn't
wish
to
disturb
my
people
so
i
groped
my
way
to
the
sofa
and
lay
down
now
i
didn't
know
anything
of
what
had
happened
during
my
absence
but
i
was
sort
of
nervous
on
my
own
account
afraid
of
being
caught
and
rather
dubious
about
the
morning
affair
and
i
had
been
lying
there
a
few
moments
when
my
eyes
gradually
got
used
to
the
darkness
and
i
became
aware
of
something
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
it
was
something
foreign
to
the
apartment
it
had
an
uncanny
appearance
and
i
sat
up
looking
very
hard
and
wondering
what
in
heaven
this
long
formless
vicious
looking
thing
might
be
first
i
thought
i'd
go
and
see
then
i
thought
never
mind
that
mind
you
i
had
no
cowardly
sensations
whatever
but
it
didn't
seem
exactly
prudent
to
investigate
but
i
somehow
couldn't
keep
my
eyes
off
the
thing
and
the
more
i
looked
at
it
the
more
disagreeably
it
grew
on
me
but
i
was
resolved
to
play
the
man
so
i
decided
to
turn
over
and
count
a
hundred
and
let
the
patch
of
moonlight
creep
up
and
show
me
what
the
dickens
it
was
i
turned
over
and
tried
to
count
but
i
couldn't
keep
my
mind
on
it
i
kept
thinking
of
that
grewsome
mass
i
was
losing
count
all
the
time
and
going
back
and
beginning
over
again
oh
no
i
wasn't
frightened
just
annoyed
but
by
the
time
i'd
gotten
to
the
century
mark
i
turned
cautiously
over
and
opened
my
eyes
with
great
fortitude
the
moonlight
revealed
to
me
a
marble
white
human
hand
well
maybe
i
wasn't
embarrassed
but
then
that
changed
to
a
creepy
feeling
again
and
i
thought
i'd
try
the
counting
again
i
don't
know
how
many
hours
or
weeks
it
was
that
i
lay
there
counting
hard
but
the
moonlight
crept
up
that
white
arm
and
it
showed
me
a
lead
face
and
a
terrible
wound
over
the
heart
i
could
scarcely
say
that
i
was
terror
stricken
or
anything
like
that
but
somehow
his
eyes
interested
me
so
that
i
went
right
out
of
the
window
i
didn't
need
the
sash
but
it
seemed
easier
to
take
it
than
leave
it
behind
now
let
that
teach
you
a
lesson
i
don't
know
just
what
it
is
but
at
seventy
years
old
i
find
that
memory
of
peculiar
value
to
me
i
have
been
unconsciously
guided
by
it
all
these
years
things
that
seemed
pigeon
holed
and
remote
are
a
perpetual
influence
yes
you're
taught
in
so
many
ways
and
you're
so
felicitously
taught
when
you
don't
know
it
here's
something
else
that
taught
me
a
good
deal
when
i
was
seventeen
i
was
very
bashful
and
a
sixteen
year
old
girl
came
to
stay
a
week
with
us
she
was
a
peach
and
i
was
seized
with
a
happiness
not
of
this
world
one
evening
my
mother
suggested
that
to
entertain
her
i
take
her
to
the
theatre
i
didn't
really
like
to
because
i
was
seventeen
and
sensitive
about
appearing
in
the
streets
with
a
girl
i
couldn't
see
my
way
to
enjoying
my
delight
in
public
but
we
went
i
didn't
feel
very
happy
i
couldn't
seem
to
keep
my
mind
on
the
play
i
became
conscious
after
a
while
that
that
was
due
less
to
my
lovely
company
than
my
boots
they
were
sweet
to
look
upon
as
smooth
as
skin
but
fitted
ten
time
as
close
i
got
oblivious
to
the
play
and
the
girl
and
the
other
people
and
everything
but
my
boots
until
i
hitched
one
partly
off
the
sensation
was
sensuously
perfect
i
couldn't
help
it
i
had
to
get
the
other
off
partly
then
i
was
obliged
to
get
them
off
altogether
except
that
i
kept
my
feet
in
the
legs
so
they
couldn't
get
away
from
that
time
i
enjoyed
the
play
but
the
first
thing
i
knew
the
curtain
came
down
like
that
without
my
notice
and
i
hadn't
any
boots
on
what's
more
they
wouldn't
go
on
i
tugged
strenuously
and
the
people
in
our
row
got
up
and
fussed
and
said
things
until
the
peach
and
i
simply
had
to
move
on
we
moved
the
girl
on
one
arm
and
the
boots
under
the
other
we
walked
home
that
way
sixteen
blocks
with
a
retinue
a
mile
long
every
time
we
passed
a
lamp
post
death
gripped
me
at
the
throat
but
we
got
home
and
i
had
on
white
socks
if
i
live
to
be
nine
hundred
and
ninety
nine
years
old
i
don't
suppose
i
could
ever
forget
that
walk
i
remember
it
about
as
keenly
as
the
chagrin
i
suffered
on
another
occasion
at
one
time
in
our
domestic
history
we
had
a
colored
butler
who
had
a
failing
he
could
never
remember
to
ask
people
who
came
to
the
door
to
state
their
business
so
i
used
to
suffer
a
good
many
calls
unnecessarily
one
morning
when
i
was
especially
busy
he
brought
me
a
card
engraved
with
a
name
i
did
not
know
so
i
said
what
does
he
wish
to
see
me
for
and
sylvester
said
ah
couldn't
ask
him
sah
he
wuz
a
genlinun
return
instantly
i
thundered
and
inquire
his
mission
ask
him
what's
his
game
well
sylvester
returned
with
the
announcement
that
he
had
lightning
rods
to
sell
indeed
said
i
things
are
coming
to
a
fine
pass
when
lightning
rod
agents
send
up
engraved
cards
he
has
pictures
added
sylvester
pictures
indeed
he
maybe
peddling
etchings
has
he
a
russia
leather
case
but
sylvester
was
too
frightened
to
remember
i
said
i
am
going
down
to
make
it
hot
for
that
upstart
i
went
down
the
stairs
working
up
my
temper
all
the
way
when
i
got
to
the
parlor
i
was
in
a
fine
frenzy
concealed
beneath
a
veneer
of
frigid
courtesy
and
when
i
looked
in
the
door
sure
enough
he
had
a
russia
leather
case
in
his
hand
but
i
didn't
happen
to
notice
that
it
was
our
russia
leather
case
and
if
you'd
believe
me
that
man
was
sitting
with
a
whole
gallery
of
etchings
spread
out
before
him
but
i
didn't
happen
to
notice
that
they
were
our
etchings
spread
out
by
some
member
of
my
family
for
some
unguessed
purpose
very
curtly
i
asked
the
gentleman
his
business
with
a
surprised
timid
manner
he
faltered
that
he
had
met
my
wife
and
daughter
at
onteora
and
they
had
asked
him
to
call
fine
lie
i
thought
and
i
froze
him
he
seemed
to
be
kind
of
non
plussed
and
sat
there
fingering
the
etchings
in
the
case
until
i
told
him
he
needn't
bother
because
we
had
those
that
pleased
him
so
much
that
he
leaned
over
in
an
embarrassed
way
to
pick
up
another
from
the
floor
but
i
stopped
him
i
said
we've
got
that
too
he
seemed
pitifully
amazed
but
i
was
congratulating
myself
on
my
great
success
finally
the
gentleman
asked
where
mr
winton
lived
he'd
met
him
in
the
mountains
too
so
i
said
i'd
show
him
gladly
and
i
did
on
the
spot
and
when
he
was
gone
i
felt
queer
because
there
were
all
his
etchings
spread
out
on
the
floor
well
my
wife
came
in
and
asked
me
who
had
been
in
i
showed
her
the
card
and
told
her
all
exultantly
to
my
dismay
she
nearly
fainted
she
told
me
he
had
been
a
most
kind
friend
to
them
in
the
country
and
had
forgotten
to
tell
me
that
he
was
expected
our
way
and
she
pushed
me
out
of
the
door
and
commanded
me
to
get
over
to
the
wintons
in
a
hurry
and
get
him
back
i
came
into
the
drawing
room
where
mrs
winton
was
sitting
up
very
stiff
in
a
chair
beating
me
at
my
own
game
well
i
began
to
put
another
light
on
things
before
many
seconds
mrs
winton
saw
it
was
time
to
change
her
temperature
in
five
minutes
i
had
asked
the
man
to
luncheon
and
she
to
dinner
and
so
on
we
made
that
fellow
change
his
trip
and
stay
a
week
and
we
gave
him
the
time
of
his
life
why
i
don't
believe
we
let
him
get
sober
the
whole
time
i
trust
that
you
will
carry
away
some
good
thought
from
these
lessons
i
have
given
you
and
that
the
memory
of
them
will
inspire
you
to
higher
things
and
elevate
you
to
plans
far
above
the
old
and
and
and
i
tell
you
one
thing
young
ladies
i've
had
a
better
time
with
you
to
day
than
with
that
peach
fifty
three
years
ago
queen
victoria
address
to
the
british
schools
and
universities
club
at
delmonico's
monday
may
in
honor
of
queen
victoria's
birthday
mr
clemens
told
the
story
of
his
duel
with
a
rival
editor
how
he
practised
firing
at
a
barn
door
and
failed
to
hit
it
but
a
friend
of
his
took
off
the
head
of
a
little
bird
at
thirty
five
yards
and
attributed
the
shot
to
mark
twain
the
duel
did
not
take
place
mr
clemens
continued
as
follows
it
also
happened
that
i
was
the
means
of
stopping
duelling
in
nevada
for
a
law
was
passed
sending
all
duellists
to
jail
for
two
years
and
the
governor
hearing
of
my
marksmanship
said
that
if
he
got
me
i
should
go
to
prison
for
the
full
term
that's
why
i
left
nevada
and
i
have
not
been
there
since
you
do
me
a
high
honor
indeed
in
selecting
me
to
speak
of
my
country
in
this
commemoration
of
the
birthday
of
that
noble
lady
whose
life
was
consecrated
to
the
virtues
and
the
humanities
and
to
the
promotion
of
lofty
ideals
and
was
a
model
upon
which
many
a
humbler
life
was
formed
and
made
beautiful
while
she
lived
and
upon
which
many
such
lives
will
still
be
formed
in
the
generations
that
are
to
come
a
life
which
finds
its
just
image
in
the
star
which
falls
out
of
its
place
in
the
sky
and
out
of
existence
but
whose
light
still
streams
with
unfaded
lustre
across
the
abysses
of
space
long
after
its
fires
have
been
extinguished
at
their
source
as
a
woman
the
queen
was
all
that
the
most
exacting
standards
could
require
as
a
far
reaching
and
effective
beneficent
moral
force
she
had
no
peer
in
her
time
among
either
monarchs
or
commoners
as
a
monarch
she
was
without
reproach
in
her
great
office
we
may
not
venture
perhaps
to
say
so
sweeping
a
thing
as
this
in
cold
blood
about
any
monarch
that
preceded
her
upon
either
her
own
throne
or
upon
any
other
it
is
a
colossal
eulogy
but
it
is
justified
in
those
qualities
of
the
heart
which
beget
affection
in
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
she
was
rich
surprisingly
rich
and
for
this
she
will
still
be
remembered
and
revered
in
the
far
off
ages
when
the
political
glories
of
her
reign
shall
have
faded
from
vital
history
and
fallen
to
a
place
in
that
scrap
heap
of
unverifiable
odds
and
ends
which
we
call
tradition
which
is
to
say
in
briefer
phrase
that
her
name
will
live
always
and
with
it
her
character
a
fame
rare
in
the
history
of
thrones
dominions
principalities
and
powers
since
it
will
not
rest
upon
harvested
selfish
and
sordid
ambitions
but
upon
love
earned
and
freely
vouchsafed
she
mended
broken
hearts
where
she
could
but
she
broke
none
what
she
did
for
us
in
america
in
our
time
of
storm
and
stress
we
shall
not
forget
and
whenever
we
call
it
to
mind
we
shall
always
remember
the
wise
and
righteous
mind
that
guided
her
in
it
and
sustained
and
supported
her
prince
albert's
we
need
not
talk
any
idle
talk
here
to
night
about
either
possible
or
impossible
war
between
the
two
countries
there
will
be
no
war
while
we
remain
sane
and
the
son
of
victoria
and
albert
sits
upon
the
throne
in
conclusion
i
believe
i
may
justly
claim
to
utter
the
voice
of
my
country
in
saying
that
we
hold
him
in
deep
honor
and
also
in
cordially
wishing
him
a
long
life
and
a
happy
reign

a
page
bearing
her
flag
of
battle
courtesied
reverently
and
tendered
mr
clemens
a
laurel
wreath
on
a
satin
pillow
he
tried
to
speak
but
his
voice
failed
from
excess
of
emotion
i
thank
you
he
finally
exclaimed
and
pulling
himself
together
he
began
his
speech
now
there
is
an
illustration
to
the
retreating
joan
of
that
is
exactly
what
i
wanted
precisely
what
i
wanted
when
i
was
describing
to
myself
joan
of
arc
after
studying
her
history
and
her
character
for
twelve
years
diligently
that
was
the
product
not
the
conventional
joan
of
arc
wherever
you
find
the
conventional
joan
of
arc
in
history
she
is
an
offence
to
anybody
who
knows
the
story
of
that
wonderful
girl
why
she
was
she
was
almost
supreme
in
several
details
she
had
a
marvellous
intellect
she
had
a
great
heart
had
a
noble
spirit
was
absolutely
pure
in
her
character
her
feeling
her
language
her
words
her
everything
she
was
only
eighteen
years
old
now
put
that
heart
into
such
a
breast
eighteen
years
old
and
give
it
that
masterly
intellect
which
showed
in
the
face
and
furnish
it
with
that
almost
god
like
spirit
and
what
are
you
going
to
have
the
conventional
joan
of
arc
not
by
any
means
that
is
impossible
i
cannot
comprehend
any
such
thing
as
that
you
must
have
a
creature
like
that
young
and
fair
and
beautiful
girl
we
just
saw
and
her
spirit
must
look
out
of
the
eyes
the
figure
should
be
the
figure
should
be
in
harmony
with
all
that
but
oh
what
we
get
in
the
conventional
picture
and
it
is
always
the
conventional
picture
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
say
that
your
guild
when
you
take
the
conventional
you
have
got
it
at
second
hand
certainly
if
you
had
studied
and
studied
then
you
might
have
something
else
as
a
result
but
when
you
have
the
common
convention
you
stick
to
that
you
cannot
prevail
upon
the
artist
to
do
it
he
always
gives
you
a
joan
of
arc
that
lovely
creature
that
started
a
great
career
at
thirteen
but
whose
greatness
arrived
when
she
was
eighteen
and
merely
because
she
was
a
girl
he
can
not
see
the
divinity
in
her
and
so
he
paints
a
peasant
a
coarse
and
lubberly
figure
the
figure
of
a
cotton
bale
and
he
clothes
that
in
the
coarsest
raiment
of
the
peasant
region
just
like
a
fish
woman
her
hair
cropped
short
like
a
russian
peasant
and
that
face
of
hers
which
should
be
beautiful
and
which
should
radiate
all
the
glories
which
are
in
the
spirit
and
in
her
heart
that
expression
in
that
face
is
always
just
the
fixed
expression
of
a
ham
but
now
mr
beard
has
intimated
a
moment
ago
and
so
has
sir
purdon
clarke
also
that
the
artist
the
illustrator
does
not
often
get
the
idea
of
the
man
whose
book
he
is
illustrating
here
is
a
very
remarkable
instance
of
the
other
thing
in
mr
beard
who
illustrated
a
book
of
mine
you
may
never
have
heard
of
it
i
will
tell
you
about
it
now
a
yankee
in
king
arthur's
court
now
beard
got
everything
that
i
put
into
that
book
and
a
little
more
besides
those
pictures
of
beard's
in
that
book
oh
from
the
first
page
to
the
last
is
one
vast
sardonic
laugh
at
the
trivialities
the
servilities
of
our
poor
human
race
and
also
at
the
professions
and
the
insolence
of
priest
craft
and
king
craft
those
creatures
that
make
slaves
of
themselves
and
have
not
the
manliness
to
shake
it
off
beard
put
it
all
in
that
book
i
meant
it
to
be
there
i
put
a
lot
of
it
there
and
beard
put
the
rest
that
publisher
of
mine
in
hartford
had
an
eye
for
the
pennies
and
he
saved
them
he
did
not
waste
any
on
the
illustrations
he
had
a
very
good
artist
williams
who
had
never
taken
a
lesson
in
drawing
everything
he
did
was
original
the
publisher
hired
the
cheapest
wood
engraver
he
could
find
and
in
my
early
books
you
can
see
a
trace
of
that
you
can
see
that
if
williams
had
had
a
chance
he
would
have
made
some
very
good
pictures
he
had
a
good
heart
and
good
intentions
i
had
a
character
in
the
first
book
he
illustrated
the
innocents
abroad
that
was
a
boy
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
old
jack
van
nostrand
a
new
york
boy
who
to
my
mind
was
a
very
remarkable
creature
he
and
i
tried
to
get
williams
to
understand
that
boy
and
make
a
picture
of
jack
that
would
be
worthy
of
jack
jack
was
a
most
singular
combination
he
was
born
and
reared
in
new
york
here
he
was
as
delicate
in
his
feelings
as
clean
and
pure
and
refined
in
his
feelings
as
any
lovely
girl
that
ever
was
but
whenever
he
expressed
a
feeling
he
did
it
in
bowery
slang
and
it
was
a
most
curious
combination
that
delicacy
of
his
and
that
apparent
coarseness
there
was
no
coarseness
inside
of
jack
at
all
and
jack
in
the
course
of
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
had
acquired
a
capital
of
ignorance
that
was
marvellous
ignorance
of
various
things
not
of
all
things
for
instance
he
did
not
know
anything
about
the
bible
he
had
never
been
in
sunday
school
jack
got
more
out
of
the
holy
land
than
anybody
else
because
the
others
knew
what
they
were
expecting
but
it
was
a
land
of
surprises
to
him
i
said
in
the
book
that
we
found
him
watching
a
turtle
on
a
log
stoning
that
turtle
and
he
was
stoning
that
turtle
because
he
had
read
that
the
song
of
the
turtle
was
heard
in
the
land
and
this
turtle
wouldn't
sing
it
sounded
absurd
but
it
was
charged
on
jack
as
a
fact
and
as
he
went
along
through
that
country
he
had
a
proper
foil
in
an
old
rebel
colonel
who
was
superintendent
and
head
engineer
in
a
large
sunday
school
in
wheeling
west
virginia
that
man
was
full
of
enthusiasm
wherever
he
went
and
would
stand
and
deliver
himself
of
speeches
and
jack
would
listen
to
those
speeches
of
the
colonel
and
wonder
jack
had
made
a
trip
as
a
child
almost
across
this
continent
in
the
first
overland
stage
coach
that
man's
name
who
ran
that
line
of
stages
well
i
declare
that
name
is
gone
well
names
will
go
halliday
ah
that's
the
name
ben
halliday
your
uncle
to
mr
that
was
the
fellow
ben
halliday
and
jack
was
full
of
admiration
at
the
prodigious
speed
that
that
line
of
stages
made
and
it
was
good
speed
one
hundred
and
twenty
five
miles
a
day
going
day
and
night
and
it
was
the
event
of
jack's
life
and
there
at
the
fords
of
the
jordan
the
colonel
was
inspired
to
a
speech
he
was
always
making
a
speech
so
he
called
us
up
to
him
he
called
up
five
sinners
and
three
saints
it
has
been
only
lately
that
mr
carnegie
beatified
me
and
he
said
here
are
the
fords
of
the
jordan
a
monumental
place
at
this
very
point
when
moses
brought
the
children
of
israel
through
he
brought
the
children
of
israel
from
egypt
through
the
desert
you
see
there
he
guarded
them
through
that
desert
patiently
patiently
during
forty
years
and
brought
them
to
this
spot
safe
and
sound
there
you
see
there
is
the
scene
of
what
moses
did
and
jack
said
moses
who
oh
he
says
jack
you
ought
not
to
ask
that
moses
the
great
law
giver
moses
the
great
patriot
moses
the
great
warrior
moses
the
great
guide
who
as
i
tell
you
brought
these
people
through
these
three
hundred
miles
of
sand
in
forty
years
and
landed
them
safe
and
sound
jack
said
there's
nothin
in
that
three
hundred
miles
in
forty
years
ben
halliday
would
have
snaked
em
through
in
thirty
six
hours
well
i
was
speaking
of
jack's
innocence
and
it
was
beautiful
jack
was
not
ignorant
on
all
subjects
that
boy
was
a
deep
student
in
the
history
of
anglo
saxon
liberty
and
he
was
a
patriot
all
the
way
through
to
the
marrow
there
was
a
subject
that
interested
him
all
the
time
other
subjects
were
of
no
concern
to
jack
but
that
quaint
inscrutable
innocence
of
his
i
could
not
get
williams
to
put
into
the
picture
yes
williams
wanted
to
do
it
he
said
i
will
make
him
as
innocent
as
a
virgin
he
thought
a
moment
and
then
said
i
will
make
him
as
innocent
as
an
unborn
virgin
which
covered
the
ground
i
was
reminded
of
jack
because
i
came
across
a
letter
to
day
which
is
over
thirty
years
old
that
jack
wrote
jack
was
doomed
to
consumption
he
was
very
long
and
slim
poor
creature
and
in
a
year
or
two
after
he
got
back
from
that
excursion
to
the
holy
land
he
went
on
a
ride
on
horseback
through
colorado
and
he
did
not
last
but
a
year
or
two
he
wrote
this
letter
not
to
me
but
to
a
friend
of
mine
and
he
said
i
have
ridden
horseback
this
was
three
years
after
i
have
ridden
horseback
four
hundred
miles
through
a
desert
country
where
you
never
see
anything
but
cattle
now
and
then
and
now
and
then
a
cattle
station
ten
miles
apart
twenty
miles
apart
now
you
tell
clemens
that
in
all
that
stretch
of
four
hundred
miles
i
have
seen
only
two
books
the
bible
and
innocents
abroad
tell
clemens
the
bible
was
in
a
very
good
condition
i
say
that
he
had
studied
and
he
had
the
real
saxon
liberty
the
acquirement
of
our
liberty
and
jack
used
to
repeat
some
verses
i
don't
know
where
they
came
from
but
i
thought
of
them
to
day
when
i
saw
that
letter
that
that
boy
could
have
been
talking
of
himself
in
those
quoted
lines
from
that
unknown
poet
for
he
had
sat
at
sidney's
feet
and
walked
with
him
in
plain
apart
and
through
the
centuries
heard
the
beat
of
freedom's
march
through
cromwell's
heart
and
he
was
that
kind
of
a
boy
he
should
have
lived
and
yet
he
should
not
have
lived
because
he
died
at
that
early
age
he
couldn't
have
been
more
than
twenty
he
had
seen
all
there
was
to
see
in
the
world
that
was
worth
the
trouble
of
living
in
it
he
had
seen
all
of
this
world
that
is
valuable
he
had
seen
all
of
this
world
that
was
illusion
and
illusion
is
the
only
valuable
thing
in
it
he
had
arrived
at
that
point
where
presently
the
illusions
would
cease
and
he
would
have
entered
upon
the
realities
of
life
and
god
help
the
man
that
has
arrived
at
that
point
accident
insurance
etc
delivered
in
hartford
at
a
dinner
to
cornelius
walford
of
london
gentlemen
i
am
glad
indeed
to
assist
in
welcoming
the
distinguished
guest
of
this
occasion
to
a
city
whose
fame
as
an
insurance
centre
has
extended
to
all
lands
and
given
us
the
name
of
being
a
quadruple
band
of
brothers
working
sweetly
hand
in
hand
the
colt's
arms
company
making
the
destruction
of
our
race
easy
and
convenient
our
life
insurance
citizens
paying
for
the
victims
when
they
pass
away
mr
batterson
perpetuating
their
memory
with
his
stately
monuments
and
our
fire
insurance
comrades
taking
care
of
their
hereafter
i
am
glad
to
assist
in
welcoming
our
guest
first
because
he
is
an
englishman
and
i
owe
a
heavy
debt
of
hospitality
to
certain
of
his
fellow
countrymen
and
secondly
because
he
is
in
sympathy
with
insurance
and
has
been
the
means
of
making
many
other
men
cast
their
sympathies
in
the
same
direction
certainly
there
is
no
nobler
field
for
human
effort
than
the
insurance
line
of
business
especially
accident
insurance
ever
since
i
have
been
a
director
in
an
accident
insurance
company
i
have
felt
that
i
am
a
better
man
life
has
seemed
more
precious
accidents
have
assumed
a
kindlier
aspect
distressing
special
providences
have
lost
half
their
horror
i
look
upon
a
cripple
now
with
affectionate
interest
as
an
advertisement
i
do
not
seem
to
care
for
poetry
any
more
i
do
not
care
for
politics
even
agriculture
does
not
excite
me
but
to
me
now
there
is
a
charm
about
a
railway
collision
that
is
unspeakable
there
is
nothing
more
beneficent
than
accident
insurance
i
have
seen
an
entire
family
lifted
out
of
poverty
and
into
affluence
by
the
simple
boon
of
a
broken
leg
i
have
had
people
come
to
me
on
crutches
with
tears
in
their
eyes
to
bless
this
beneficent
institution
in
all
my
experience
of
life
i
have
seen
nothing
so
seraphic
as
the
look
that
comes
into
a
freshly
mutilated
man's
face
when
he
feels
in
his
vest
pocket
with
his
remaining
hand
and
finds
his
accident
ticket
all
right
and
i
have
seen
nothing
so
sad
as
the
look
that
came
into
another
splintered
customer's
face
when
he
found
he
couldn't
collect
on
a
wooden
leg
i
will
remark
here
by
way
of
advertisement
that
that
noble
charity
which
we
have
named
the
hartford
accident
insurance
company
is
an
institution
which
is
peculiarly
to
be
depended
upon
a
man
is
bound
to
prosper
who
gives
it
his
custom
no
man
can
take
out
a
policy
in
it
and
not
get
crippled
before
the
year
is
out
now
there
was
one
indigent
man
who
had
been
disappointed
so
often
with
other
companies
that
he
had
grown
disheartened
his
appetite
left
him
he
ceased
to
smile
said
life
was
but
a
weariness
three
weeks
ago
i
got
him
to
insure
with
us
and
now
he
is
the
brightest
happiest
spirit
in
this
land
has
a
good
steady
income
and
a
stylish
suit
of
new
bandages
every
day
and
travels
around
on
a
shutter
i
will
say
in
conclusion
that
my
share
of
the
welcome
to
our
guest
is
none
the
less
hearty
because
i
talk
so
much
nonsense
and
i
know
that
i
can
say
the
same
far
the
rest
of
the
speakers
the
speaker
was
a
director
of
the
company
named
osteopathy
on
february
mr
clemens
appeared
before
the
assembly
committee
in
albany
new
york
in
favor
of
the
seymour
bill
legalizing
the
practice
of
osteopathy
mr
chairman
and
gentlemen
dr
van
fleet
is
the
gentleman
who
gave
me
the
character
i
have
heard
my
character
discussed
a
thousand
times
before
you
were
born
sir
and
shown
the
iniquities
in
it
and
you
did
not
get
more
than
half
of
them
i
was
touched
and
distressed
when
they
brought
that
part
of
a
child
in
here
and
proved
that
you
cannot
take
a
child
to
pieces
in
that
way
what
remarkable
names
those
diseases
have
it
makes
me
envious
of
the
man
that
has
them
all
i
have
had
many
diseases
and
am
thankful
for
all
i
have
had
one
of
the
gentlemen
spoke
of
the
knowledge
of
something
else
found
in
sweden
a
treatment
which
i
took
it
is
i
suppose
a
kindred
thing
there
is
apparently
no
great
difference
between
them
i
was
a
year
and
a
half
in
london
and
sweden
in
the
hands
of
that
grand
old
man
mr
kildren
i
cannot
call
him
a
doctor
for
he
has
not
the
authority
to
give
a
certificate
if
a
patient
should
die
but
fortunately
they
don't
the
state
stands
as
a
mighty
gibraltar
clothed
with
power
it
stands
between
me
and
my
body
and
tells
me
what
kind
of
a
doctor
i
must
employ
when
my
soul
is
sick
unlimited
spiritual
liberty
is
given
me
by
the
state
now
then
it
doesn't
seem
logical
that
the
state
shall
depart
from
this
great
policy
the
health
of
the
soul
and
change
about
and
take
the
other
position
in
the
matter
of
smaller
consequence
the
health
of
the
body
the
bell
bill
limitations
would
drive
the
osteopaths
out
of
the
state
oh
dear
me
when
you
drive
somebody
out
of
the
state
you
create
the
same
condition
as
prevailed
in
the
garden
of
eden
you
want
the
thing
that
you
can't
have
i
didn't
care
much
about
the
osteopaths
but
as
soon
as
i
found
they
were
going
to
drive
them
out
i
got
in
a
state
of
uneasiness
and
i
can't
sleep
nights
now
i
know
how
adam
felt
in
the
garden
of
eden
about
the
prohibited
apple
adam
didn't
want
the
apple
till
he
found
out
he
couldn't
have
it
just
as
he
would
have
wanted
osteopathy
if
he
couldn't
have
it
whose
property
is
my
body
probably
mine
i
so
regard
it
if
i
experiment
with
it
who
must
be
answerable
i
not
the
state
if
i
choose
injudiciously
does
the
state
die
oh
no
i
was
the
subject
of
my
mother's
experiment
she
was
wise
she
made
experiments
cautiously
she
didn't
pick
out
just
any
child
in
the
flock
no
she
chose
judiciously
she
chose
one
she
could
spare
and
she
couldn't
spare
the
others
i
was
the
choice
child
of
the
flock
so
i
had
to
take
all
of
the
experiments
in
kneipp
filled
the
world
with
the
wonder
of
the
water
cure
mother
wanted
to
try
it
but
on
sober
second
thought
she
put
me
through
a
bucket
of
ice
water
was
poured
over
to
see
the
effect
then
i
was
rubbed
down
with
flannels
sheet
was
dipped
in
the
water
and
i
was
put
to
bed
i
perspired
so
much
that
mother
put
a
life
preserver
to
bed
with
me
but
this
had
nothing
but
a
spiritual
effect
on
me
and
i
didn't
care
for
that
when
they
took
off
the
sheet
it
was
yellow
from
the
output
of
my
conscience
the
exudation
of
sin
it
purified
me
spiritually
and
it
remains
until
this
day
i
have
experimented
with
osteopathy
and
allopathy
i
took
a
chance
at
the
latter
for
old
times
sake
for
three
times
when
a
boy
mother's
new
methods
got
me
so
near
death's
door
she
had
to
call
in
the
family
physician
to
pull
me
out
the
physicians
think
they
are
moved
by
regard
for
the
best
interests
of
the
public
isn't
there
a
little
touch
of
self
interest
back
of
it
all
it
seems
to
me
there
is
and
i
don't
claim
to
have
all
the
virtues
only
nine
or
ten
of
them
i
was
born
in
the
banner
state
and
by
banner
state
i
mean
missouri
osteopathy
was
born
in
the
same
state
and
both
of
us
are
getting
along
reasonably
well
at
a
time
during
my
younger
days
my
attention
was
attracted
to
a
picture
of
a
house
which
bore
the
inscription
christ
disputing
with
the
doctors
i
could
attach
no
other
meaning
to
it
than
that
christ
was
actually
quarreling
with
the
doctors
so
i
asked
an
old
slave
who
was
a
sort
of
a
herb
doctor
in
a
small
way
unlicensed
of
course
what
the
meaning
of
the
picture
was
what
had
he
done
i
asked
and
the
colored
man
replied
humph
he
ain't
got
no
license
water
supply
mr
clemens
visited
albany
on
february
and
the
privileges
of
the
floor
were
granted
to
him
and
he
was
asked
to
make
a
short
address
to
the
senate
mr
president
and
gentlemen
i
do
not
know
how
to
thank
you
sufficiently
for
this
high
honor
which
you
are
conferring
upon
me
i
have
for
the
second
time
now
enjoyed
this
kind
of
prodigal
hospitality
in
the
other
house
yesterday
to
day
in
this
one
i
am
a
modest
man
and
diffident
about
appearing
before
legislative
bodies
and
yet
utterly
and
entirely
appreciative
of
a
courtesy
like
this
when
it
is
extended
to
me
and
i
thank
you
very
much
for
it
if
i
had
the
privilege
which
unfortunately
i
have
not
got
of
suggesting
things
to
the
legislators
in
my
individual
capacity
i
would
so
enjoy
the
opportunity
that
i
would
not
charge
anything
for
it
at
all
i
would
do
that
without
a
salary
i
would
give
them
the
benefit
of
my
wisdom
and
experience
in
legislative
bodies
and
if
i
could
have
had
the
privilege
for
a
few
minutes
of
giving
advice
to
the
other
house
i
should
have
liked
to
but
of
course
i
could
not
undertake
it
as
they
did
not
ask
me
to
do
it
but
if
they
had
only
asked
me
now
that
the
house
is
considering
a
measure
which
is
to
furnish
a
water
supply
to
the
city
of
new
york
why
permit
me
to
say
i
live
in
new
york
myself
i
know
all
about
its
ways
its
desires
and
its
residents
and
if
i
had
the
privilege
i
should
have
urged
them
not
to
weary
themselves
over
a
measure
like
that
to
furnish
water
to
the
city
of
new
york
for
we
never
drink
it
but
i
will
not
venture
to
advise
this
body
as
i
only
venture
to
advise
bodies
who
are
not
present
mistaken
identity
address
at
the
annual
ladies
day
papyrus
club
boston
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
am
perfectly
astonished
a
s
t
o
n
i
s
h
e
d
ladies
and
gentlemen
astonished
at
the
way
history
repeats
itself
i
find
myself
situated
at
this
moment
exactly
and
precisely
as
i
was
once
before
years
ago
to
a
jot
to
a
tittle
to
a
very
hair
there
isn't
a
shade
of
difference
it
is
the
most
astonishing
coincidence
that
ever
but
wait
i
will
tell
you
the
former
instance
and
then
you
will
see
it
for
yourself
years
ago
i
arrived
one
day
at
salamanca
new
york
eastward
bound
must
change
cars
there
and
take
the
sleeper
train
there
were
crowds
of
people
there
and
they
were
swarming
into
the
long
sleeper
train
and
packing
it
full
and
it
was
a
perfect
purgatory
of
dust
and
confusion
and
gritting
of
teeth
and
soft
sweet
and
low
profanity
i
asked
the
young
man
in
the
ticket
office
if
i
could
have
a
sleeping
section
and
he
answered
no
with
a
snarl
that
shrivelled
me
up
like
burned
leather
i
went
off
smarting
under
this
insult
to
my
dignity
and
asked
another
local
official
supplicatingly
if
i
couldn't
have
some
poor
little
corner
somewhere
in
a
sleeping
car
but
he
cut
me
short
with
a
venomous
no
you
can't
every
corner
is
full
now
don't
bother
me
any
more
and
he
turned
his
back
and
walked
off
my
dignity
was
in
a
state
now
which
cannot
be
described
i
was
so
ruffled
that
well
i
said
to
my
companion
if
these
people
knew
who
i
am
they
but
my
companion
cut
me
short
there
don't
talk
such
folly
he
said
if
they
did
know
who
you
are
do
you
suppose
it
would
help
your
high
mightiness
to
a
vacancy
in
a
train
which
has
no
vacancies
in
it
this
did
not
improve
my
condition
any
to
speak
of
but
just
then
i
observed
that
the
colored
porter
of
a
sleeping
car
had
his
eye
on
me
i
saw
his
dark
countenance
light
up
he
whispered
to
the
uniformed
conductor
punctuating
with
nods
and
jerks
toward
me
and
straightway
this
conductor
came
forward
oozing
politeness
from
every
pore
can
i
be
of
any
service
to
you
he
asked
will
you
have
a
place
in
the
sleeper
yes
i
said
and
much
oblige
me
too
give
me
anything
anything
will
answer
we
have
nothing
left
but
the
big
family
state
room
he
continued
with
two
berths
and
a
couple
of
arm
chairs
in
it
but
it
is
entirely
at
your
disposal
here
tom
take
these
satchels
aboard
then
he
touched
his
hat
and
we
and
the
colored
tom
moved
along
i
was
bursting
to
drop
just
one
little
remark
to
my
companion
but
i
held
in
and
waited
tom
made
us
comfortable
in
that
sumptuous
great
apartment
and
then
said
with
many
bows
and
a
perfect
affluence
of
smiles

thumbs

my
armholes
smiled
a
smile
on
my
companion
and
said
gently
well
what
do
you
say
now
my
companion
was
not
in
the
humor
to
respond
and
didn't
the
next
moment
that
smiling
black
face
was
thrust
in
at
the
crack
of
the
door
and
this
speech
followed

he
disappeared
again
my
companion
said
vinegarishly
well
well
what
do
you
say
now
right
there
comes
in
the
marvellous
coincidence
i
mentioned
a
while
ago
viz
i
was
speechless
and
that
is
my
condition
now
perceive
it
cats
and
candy
the
following
address
was
delivered
at
a
social
meeting
of
literary
men
in
new
york
in
when
i
was
fourteen
i
was
living
with
my
parents
who
were
very
poor
and
correspondently
honest
we
had
a
youth
living
with
us
by
the
name
of
jim
wolfe
he
was
an
excellent
fellow
seventeen
years
old
and
very
diffident
he
and
i
slept
together
virtuously
and
one
bitter
winter's
night
a
cousin
mary
she's
married
now
and
gone
gave
what
they
call
a
candy
pulling
in
those
days
in
the
west
and
they
took
the
saucers
of
hot
candy
outside
of
the
house
into
the
snow
under
a
sort
of
old
bower
that
came
from
the
eaves
it
was
a
sort
of
an
ell
then
all
covered
with
vines
to
cool
this
hot
candy
in
the
snow
and
they
were
all
sitting
there
in
the
mean
time
we
were
gone
to
bed
we
were
not
invited
to
attend
this
party
we
were
too
young
the
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
assembled
there
and
jim
and
i
were
in
bed
there
was
about
four
inches
of
snow
on
the
roof
of
this
ell
and
our
windows
looked
out
on
it
and
it
was
frozen
hard
a
couple
of
tom
cats
it
is
possible
one
might
have
been
of
the
opposite
sex
were
assembled
on
the
chimney
in
the
middle
of
this
ell
and
they
were
growling
at
a
fearful
rate
and
switching
their
tails
about
and
going
on
and
we
couldn't
sleep
at
all
finally
jim
said
for
two
cents
i'd
go
out
and
snake
them
cats
off
that
chimney
so
i
said
of
course
you
would
he
said
well
i
would
i
have
a
mighty
good
notion
to
do
it
says
i
of
course
you
have
certainly
you
have
you
have
a
great
notion
to
do
it
i
hoped
he
might
try
it
but
i
was
afraid
he
wouldn't
finally
i
did
get
his
ambition
up
and
he
raised
the
window
and
climbed
out
on
the
icy
roof
with
nothing
on
but
his
socks
and
a
very
short
shirt
he
went
climbing
along
on
all
fours
on
the
roof
toward
the
chimney
where
the
cats
were
in
the
mean
time
these
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
enjoying
themselves
down
under
the
eaves
and
when
jim
got
almost
to
that
chimney
he
made
a
pass
at
the
cats
and
his
heels
flew
up
and
he
shot
down
and
crashed
through
those
vines
and
lit
in
the
midst
of
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
sat
down
in
those
hot
saucers
of
candy
there
was
a
stampede
of
course
and
he
came
up
stairs
dropping
pieces
of
chinaware
and
candy
all
the
way
up
and
when
he
got
up
there
now
anybody
in
the
world
would
have
gone
into
profanity
or
something
calculated
to
relieve
the
mind
but
he
didn't
he
scraped
the
candy
off
his
legs
nursed
his
blisters
a
little
and
said
i
could
have
ketched
them
cats
if
i
had
had
on
a
good
ready
any
reader
know
what
a
ready
was
in
d
w
obituary
poetry
address
at
the
actors
fund
fair
philadelphia
in
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
er
this
er
welcome
occasion
gives
me
an
er
opportunity
to
make
an
er
explanation
that
i
have
long
desired
to
deliver
myself
of
i
rise
to
the
highest
honors
before
a
philadelphia
audience
in
the
course
of
my
checkered
career
i
have
on
divers
occasions
been
charged
er
maliciously
with
a
more
or
less
serious
offence
it
is
in
reply
to
one
of
the
more
er
important
of
these
that
i
wish
to
speak
more
than
once
i
have
been
accused
of
writing
obituary
poetry
in
the
philadelphia
ledger
i
wish
right
here
to
deny
that
dreadful
assertion
i
will
admit
that
once
when
a
compositor
in
the
ledger
establishment
i
did
set
up
some
of
that
poetry
but
for
a
worse
offence
than
that
no
indictment
can
be
found
against
me
i
did
not
write
that
poetry
at
least
not
all
of
it
cigars
and
tobacco
my
friends
for
some
years
now
have
remarked
that
i
am
an
inveterate
consumer
of
tobacco
that
is
true
but
my
habits
with
regard
to
tobacco
have
changed
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
will
say
when
i
have
explained
to
you
what
my
present
purpose
is
that
my
taste
has
deteriorated
but
i
do
not
so
regard
it
whenever
i
held
a
smoking
party
at
my
house
i
found
that
my
guests
had
always
just
taken
the
pledge
let
me
tell
you
briefly
the
history
of
my
personal
relation
to
tobacco
it
began
i
think
when
i
was
a
lad
and
took
the
form
of
a
quid
which
i
became
expert
in
tucking
under
my
tongue
afterward
i
learned
the
delights
of
the
pipe
and
i
suppose
there
was
no
other
youngster
of
my
age
who
could
more
deftly
cut
plug
tobacco
so
as
to
make
it
available
for
pipe
smoking
well
time
ran
on
and
there
came
a
time
when
i
was
able
to
gratify
one
of
my
youthful
ambitions
i
could
buy
the
choicest
havana
cigars
without
seriously
interfering
with
my
income
i
smoked
a
good
many
changing
off
from
the
havana
cigars
to
the
pipe
in
the
course
of
a
day's
smoking
at
last
it
occurred
to
me
that
something
was
lacking
in
the
havana
cigar
it
did
not
quite
fulfil
my
youthful
anticipations
i
experimented
i
bought
what
was
called
a
seed
leaf
cigar
with
a
connecticut
wrapper
after
a
while
i
became
satiated
of
these
and
i
searched
for
something
else
the
pittsburg
stogy
was
recommended
to
me
it
certainly
had
the
merit
of
cheapness
if
that
be
a
merit
in
tobacco
and
i
experimented
with
the
stogy
then
once
more
i
changed
off
so
that
i
might
acquire
the
subtler
flavor
of
the
wheeling
toby
now
that
palled
and
i
looked
around
new
york
in
the
hope
of
finding
cigars
which
would
seem
to
most
people
vile
but
which
i
am
sure
would
be
ambrosial
to
me
i
couldn't
find
any
they
put
into
my
hands
some
of
those
little
things
that
cost
ten
cents
a
box
but
they
are
a
delusion
i
said
to
a
friend
i
want
to
know
if
you
can
direct
me
to
an
honest
tobacco
merchant
who
will
tell
me
what
is
the
worst
cigar
in
the
new
york
market
excepting
those
made
for
chinese
consumption
i
want
real
tobacco
if
you
will
do
this
and
i
find
the
man
is
as
good
as
his
word
i
will
guarantee
him
a
regular
market
for
a
fair
amount
of
his
cigars
we
found
a
tobacco
dealer
who
would
tell
the
truth
who
if
a
cigar
was
bad
would
boldly
say
so
he
produced
what
he
called
the
very
worst
cigars
he
had
ever
had
in
his
shop
he
let
me
experiment
with
one
then
and
there
the
test
was
satisfactory
this
was
after
all
the
real
thing
i
negotiated
for
a
box
of
them
and
took
them
away
with
me
so
that
i
might
be
sure
of
having
them
handy
when
i
want
them
i
discovered
that
the
worst
cigars
so
called
are
the
best
for
me
after
all
billiards
mr
clemens
attended
a
billiard
tourney
on
the
evening
of
april
and
was
called
on
to
tell
a
story
the
game
of
billiards
has
destroyed
my
naturally
sweet
disposition
once
when
i
was
an
underpaid
reporter
in
virginia
city
whenever
i
wished
to
play
billiards
i
went
out
to
look
for
an
easy
mark
one
day
a
stranger
came
to
town
and
opened
a
billiard
parlor
i
looked
him
over
casually
when
he
proposed
a
game
i
answered
all
right
just
knock
the
balls
around
a
little
so
that
i
can
get
your
gait
he
said
and
when
i
had
done
so
he
remarked
i
will
be
perfectly
fair
with
you
i'll
play
you
left
handed
i
felt
hurt
for
he
was
cross
eyed
freckled
and
had
red
hair
and
i
determined
to
teach
him
a
lesson
he
won
first
shot
ran
out
took
my
half
dollar
and
all
i
got
was
the
opportunity
to
chalk
my
cue
if
you
can
play
like
that
with
your
left
hand
i
said
i'd
like
to
see
you
play
with
your
right
i
can't
he
said
i'm
left
handed
the
union
right
or
wrong
reminiscences
of
nevada
i
can
assure
you
ladies
and
gentlemen
that
nevada
had
lively
newspapers
in
those
days
my
great
competitor
among
the
reporters
was
boggs
of
the
union
an
excellent
reporter
once
in
three
or
four
months
he
would
get
a
little
intoxicated
but
as
a
general
thing
he
was
a
wary
and
cautious
drinker
although
always
ready
to
damp
himself
a
little
with
the
enemy
he
had
the
advantage
of
me
in
one
thing
he
could
get
the
monthly
public
school
report
and
i
could
not
because
the
principal
hated
my
sheet
the
enterprise
one
snowy
night
when
the
report
was
due
i
started
out
sadly
wondering
how
i
was
to
get
it
presently
a
few
steps
up
the
almost
deserted
street
i
stumbled
on
boggs
and
asked
him
where
he
was
going
after
the
school
report
i'll
go
along
with
you
no
sir
i'll
excuse
you
have
it
your
own
way
a
saloon
keeper's
boy
passed
by
with
a
steaming
pitcher
of
hot
punch
and
boggs
snuffed
the
fragrance
gratefully
he
gazed
fondly
after
the
boy
and
saw
him
start
up
the
enterprise
stairs
i
said
i
wish
you
could
help
me
get
that
school
business
but
since
you
can't
i
must
run
up
to
the
union
office
and
see
if
i
can
get
a
proof
of
it
after
it's
set
up
though
i
don't
begin
to
suppose
i
can
good
night
hold
on
a
minute
i
don't
mind
getting
the
report
and
sitting
around
with
the
boys
a
little
while
you
copy
it
if
you're
willing
to
drop
down
to
the
principal's
with
me
now
you
talk
like
a
human
being
come
along
we
ploughed
a
couple
of
blocks
through
the
snow
got
the
report
a
short
document
and
soon
copied
it
in
our
office
meantime
boggs
helped
himself
to
the
punch
i
gave
the
manuscript
back
to
him
and
we
started
back
to
get
an
inquest
at
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
when
we
had
gone
to
press
and
were
having
a
relaxing
concert
as
usual
for
some
of
the
printers
were
good
singers
and
others
good
performers
on
the
guitar
and
on
that
atrocity
the
accordion
the
proprietor
of
the
union
strode
in
and
asked
if
anybody
had
heard
anything
of
boggs
or
the
school
report
we
stated
the
case
and
all
turned
out
to
help
hunt
for
the
delinquent
we
found
him
standing
on
a
table
in
a
saloon
with
an
old
tin
lantern
in
one
hand
and
the
school
report
in
the
other
haranguing
a
gang
of
corned
miners
on
the
iniquity
of
squandering
the
public
money
on
education
when
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
honest
hard
working
men
were
literally
starving
for
whiskey
he
had
been
assisting
in
a
regal
spree
with
those
parties
for
hours
we
dragged
him
away
and
put
him
into
bed
of
course
there
was
no
school
report
in
the
union
and
boggs
held
me
accountable
though
i
was
innocent
of
any
intention
or
desire
to
compass
its
absence
from
that
paper
and
was
as
sorry
as
any
one
that
the
misfortune
had
occurred
but
we
were
perfectly
friendly
the
day
the
next
school
report
was
due
the
proprietor
of
the
tennessee
mine
furnished
us
a
buggy
and
asked
us
to
go
down
and
write
something
about
the
property
a
very
common
request
and
one
always
gladly
acceded
to
when
people
furnished
buggies
for
we
were
as
fond
of
pleasure
excursions
as
other
people
the
mine
was
a
hole
in
the
ground
ninety
feet
deep
and
no
way
of
getting
down
into
it
but
by
holding
on
to
a
rope
and
being
lowered
with
a
windlass
the
workmen
had
just
gone
off
somewhere
to
dinner
i
was
not
strong
enough
to
lower
boggs's
bulk
so
i
took
an
unlighted
candle
in
my
teeth
made
a
loop
for
my
foot
in
the
end
of
the
rope
implored
boggs
not
to
go
to
sleep
or
let
the
windlass
get
the
start
of
him
and
then
swung
out
over
the
shaft
i
reached
the
bottom
muddy
and
bruised
about
the
elbows
but
safe
i
lit
the
candle
made
an
examination
of
the
rock
selected
some
specimens
and
shouted
to
boggs
to
hoist
away
no
answer
presently
a
head
appeared
in
the
circle
of
daylight
away
aloft
and
a
voice
came
down
are
you
all
set
all
set
hoist
away
are
you
comfortable
perfectly
could
you
wait
a
little
oh
certainly
no
particular
hurry
well
good
bye
why
where
are
you
going
after
the
school
report
and
he
did
i
stayed
down
there
an
hour
and
surprised
the
workmen
when
they
hauled
up
and
found
a
man
on
the
rope
instead
of
a
bucket
of
rock
i
walked
home
too
five
miles
up
hill
we
had
no
school
report
next
morning
but
the
union
had
an
ideal
french
address
extract
from
paris
notes
in
tom
sawyer
abroad
etc
i
am
told
that
a
french
sermon
is
like
a
french
speech
it
never
names
an
historical
event
but
only
the
date
of
it
if
you
are
not
up
in
dates
you
get
left
a
french
speech
is
something
like
this
comrades
citizens
brothers
noble
parts
of
the
only
sublime
and
perfect
nation
let
us
not
forget
that
the
january
cast
off
our
chains
that
the
august
relieved
us
of
the
shameful
presence
of
foreign
spies
that
the
september
was
its
own
justification
before
heaven
and
humanity
that
the
brumaire
contained
the
seeds
of
its
own
punishment
that
the
july
was
the
mighty
voice
of
liberty
proclaiming
the
resurrection
the
new
day
and
inviting
the
oppressed
peoples
of
the
earth
to
look
upon
the
divine
face
of
france
and
live
and
let
us
here
record
our
everlasting
curse
against
the
man
of
the
december
and
declare
in
thunder
tones
the
native
tones
of
france
that
but
for
him
there
had
been
no
march
in
history
no
october
nor
january
no
april
no
november
no
september
no
july
no
february
no
june
no
august
no
may
that
but
for
him
france
the
pure
the
grand
the
peerless
had
had
a
serene
and
vacant
almanac
to
day
i
have
heard
of
one
french
sermon
which
closed
in
this
odd
yet
eloquent
way
my
hearers
we
have
sad
cause
to
remember
the
man
of
the
january
the
results
of
the
vast
crime
of
the
january
have
been
in
just
proportion
to
the
magnitude
of
the
act
itself
but
for
it
there
had
been
no
november
sorrowful
spectacle
the
grisly
deed
of
the
june
had
not
been
done
but
for
it
nor
had
the
man
of
the
june
known
existence
to
it
alone
the
september
was
due
also
the
fatal
october
shall
we
then
be
grateful
for
the
january
with
its
freight
of
death
for
you
and
me
and
all
that
breathe
yes
my
friends
for
it
gave
us
also
that
which
had
never
come
but
for
it
and
it
alone
the
blessed
december
it
may
be
well
enough
to
explain
the
man
of
the
january
is
adam
the
crime
of
that
date
was
the
eating
of
the
apple
the
sorrowful
spectacle
of
the
november
was
the
expulsion
from
eden
the
grisly
deed
of
the
june
was
the
murder
of
abel
the
act
of
the
september
was
the
beginning
of
the
journey
to
the
land
of
nod
the
day
of
october
the
last
mountaintops
disappeared
under
the
flood
when
you
go
to
church
in
france
you
want
to
take
your
almanac
with
you
annotated
statistics
extract
from
the
history
of
the
savage
club
during
that
period
of
gloom
when
domestic
bereavement
had
forced
mr
clemens
and
his
dear
ones
to
secure
the
privacy
they
craved
until
their
wounds
should
heal
his
address
was
known
to
only
a
very
few
of
his
closest
friends
one
old
friend
in
new
york
after
vain
efforts
to
get
his
address
wrote
him
a
letter
addressed
as
follows
mark
twain
god
knows
where
try
london
the
letter
found
him
and
mr
clemens
replied
to
the
letter
expressing
himself
surprised
and
complimented
that
the
person
who
was
credited
with
knowing
his
whereabouts
should
take
so
much
interest
in
him
adding
had
the
letter
been
addressed
to
the
care
of
the
other
party
i
would
naturally
have
expected
to
receive
it
without
delay
his
correspondent
tried
again
and
addressed
the
second
letter
mark
twain
the
devil
knows
where
try
london
this
found
him
also
no
less
promptly
on
june
he
consented
to
visit
the
savage
club
london
on
condition
that
there
was
to
be
no
publicity
and
no
speech
was
to
be
expected
from
him
the
toastmaster
in
proposing
the
health
of
their
guest
said
that
as
a
scotchman
and
therefore
as
a
born
expert
he
thought
mark
twain
had
little
or
no
claim
to
the
title
of
humorist
mr
clemens
had
tried
to
be
funny
but
had
failed
and
his
true
role
in
life
was
statistics
that
he
was
a
master
of
statistics
and
loved
them
for
their
own
sake
and
it
would
be
the
easiest
task
he
ever
undertook
if
he
would
try
to
count
all
the
real
jokes
he
had
ever
made
while
the
toastmaster
was
speaking
the
members
saw
mr
clemens's
eyes
begin
to
sparkle
and
his
cheeks
to
flush
he
jumped
up
and
made
a
characteristic
speech
perhaps
i
am
not
a
humorist
but
i
am
a
first
class
fool
a
simpleton
for
up
to
this
moment
i
have
believed
chairman
macalister
to
be
a
decent
person
whom
i
could
allow
to
mix
up
with
my
friends
and
relatives
the
exhibition
he
has
just
made
of
himself
reveals
him
to
be
a
scoundrel
and
a
knave
of
the
deepest
dye
i
have
been
cruelly
deceived
and
it
serves
me
right
for
trusting
a
scotchman
yes
i
do
understand
figures
and
i
can
count
i
have
counted
the
words
in
macalister's
drivel
i
certainly
cannot
call
it
a
speech
and
there
were
exactly
three
thousand
four
hundred
and
thirty
nine
i
also
carefully
counted
the
lies
there
were
exactly
three
thousand
four
hundred
and
thirty
nine
therefore
i
leave
macalister
to
his
fate
i
was
sorry
to
have
my
name
mentioned
as
one
of
the
great
authors
because
they
have
a
sad
habit
of
dying
off
chaucer
is
dead
spencer
is
dead
so
is
milton
so
is
shakespeare
and
i
am
not
feeling
very
well
myself
galveston
orphan
bazaar
address
at
a
fair
held
at
the
waldorf
astoria
new
york
in
october
in
aid
of
the
orphans
at
galveston
i
expected
that
the
governor
of
texas
would
occupy
this
place
first
and
would
speak
to
you
and
in
the
course
of
his
remarks
would
drop
a
text
for
me
to
talk
from
but
with
the
proverbial
obstinacy
that
is
proverbial
with
governors
they
go
back
on
their
duties
and
he
has
not
come
here
and
has
not
furnished
me
with
a
text
and
i
am
here
without
a
text
i
have
no
text
except
what
you
furnish
me
with
your
handsome
faces
and
but
i
won't
continue
that
for
i
could
go
on
forever
about
attractive
faces
beautiful
dresses
and
other
things
but
after
all
compliments
should
be
in
order
in
a
place
like
this
i
have
been
in
new
york
two
or
three
days
and
have
been
in
a
condition
of
strict
diligence
night
and
day
the
object
of
this
diligence
being
to
regulate
the
moral
and
political
situation
on
this
planet
put
it
on
a
sound
basis
and
when
you
are
regulating
the
conditions
of
a
planet
it
requires
a
great
deal
of
talk
in
a
great
many
kinds
of
ways
and
when
you
have
talked
a
lot
the
emptier
you
get
and
get
also
in
a
position
of
corking
when
i
am
situated
like
that
with
nothing
to
say
i
feel
as
though
i
were
a
sort
of
fraud
i
seem
to
be
playing
a
part
and
please
consider
i
am
playing
a
part
for
want
of
something
better
and
this
is
not
unfamiliar
to
me
i
have
often
done
this
before
when
i
was
here
about
eight
years
ago
i
was
coming
up
in
a
car
of
the
elevated
road
very
few
people
were
in
that
car
and
on
one
end
of
it
there
was
no
one
except
on
the
opposite
seat
where
sat
a
man
about
fifty
years
old
with
a
most
winning
face
and
an
elegant
eye
a
beautiful
eye
and
i
took
him
from
his
dress
to
be
a
master
mechanic
a
man
who
had
a
vocation
he
had
with
him
a
very
fine
little
child
of
about
four
or
five
years
i
was
watching
the
affection
which
existed
between
those
two
i
judged
he
was
the
grandfather
perhaps
it
was
really
a
pretty
child
and
i
was
admiring
her
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
i
was
admiring
her
he
began
to
notice
me
i
could
see
his
admiration
of
me
in
his
eye
and
i
did
what
everybody
else
would
do
admired
the
child
four
times
as
much
knowing
i
would
get
four
times
as
much
of
his
admiration
things
went
on
very
pleasantly
i
was
making
my
way
into
his
heart
by
and
by
when
he
almost
reached
the
station
where
he
was
to
get
off
he
got
up
crossed
over
and
he
said
now
i
am
going
to
say
something
to
you
which
i
hope
you
will
regard
as
a
compliment
and
then
he
went
on
to
say
i
have
never
seen
mark
twain
but
i
have
seen
a
portrait
of
him
and
any
friend
of
mine
will
tell
you
that
when
i
have
once
seen
a
portrait
of
a
man
i
place
it
in
my
eye
and
store
it
away
in
my
memory
and
i
can
tell
you
now
that
you
look
enough
like
mark
twain
to
be
his
brother
now
he
said
i
hope
you
take
this
as
a
compliment
yes
you
are
a
very
good
imitation
but
when
i
come
to
look
closer
you
are
probably
not
that
man
i
said
i
will
be
frank
with
you
in
my
desire
to
look
like
that
excellent
character
i
have
dressed
for
the
character
i
have
been
playing
a
part
he
said
that
is
all
right
that
is
all
right
you
look
very
well
on
the
outside
but
when
it
comes
to
the
inside
you
are
not
in
it
with
the
original
so
when
i
come
to
a
place
like
this
with
nothing
valuable
to
say
i
always
play
a
part
but
i
will
say
before
i
sit
down
that
when
it
comes
to
saying
anything
here
i
will
express
myself
in
this
way
i
am
heartily
in
sympathy
with
you
in
your
efforts
to
help
those
who
were
sufferers
in
this
calamity
and
in
your
desire
to
help
those
who
were
rendered
homeless
and
in
saying
this
i
wish
to
impress
on
you
the
fact
that
i
am
not
playing
a
part
san
francisco
earthquake
after
the
address
at
the
robert
fulton
fund
meeting
june
mr
clemens
talked
to
the
assembled
reporters
about
the
san
francisco
earthquake
i
haven't
been
there
since
and
that
great
city
of
san
francisco
has
grown
up
since
my
day
when
i
was
there
she
had
one
hundred
and
eighteen
thousand
people
and
of
this
number
eighteen
thousand
were
chinese
i
was
a
reporter
on
the
virginia
city
enterprise
in
nevada
in
and
stayed
there
i
think
about
two
years
when
i
went
to
san
francisco
and
got
a
job
as
a
reporter
on
the
call
i
was
there
three
or
four
years
i
remember
one
day
i
was
walking
down
third
street
in
san
francisco
it
was
a
sleepy
dull
sunday
afternoon
and
no
one
was
stirring
suddenly
as
i
looked
up
the
street
about
three
hundred
yards
the
whole
side
of
a
house
fell
out
the
street
was
full
of
bricks
and
mortar
at
the
same
time
i
was
knocked
against
the
side
of
a
house
and
stood
there
stunned
for
a
moment
i
thought
it
was
an
earthquake
nobody
else
had
heard
anything
about
it
and
no
one
said
earthquake
to
me
afterward
but
i
saw
it
and
i
wrote
it
nobody
else
wrote
it
and
the
house
i
saw
go
into
the
street
was
the
only
house
in
the
city
that
felt
it
i've
always
wondered
if
it
wasn't
a
little
performance
gotten
up
for
my
especial
entertainment
by
the
nether
regions
charity
and
actors
address
at
the
actors
fund
fair
in
the
metropolitan
opera
house
new
york
may
mr
clemens
in
his
white
suit
formally
declared
the
fair
open
mr
daniel
frohman
in
introducing
mr
clemens
said
we
intend
to
make
this
a
banner
week
in
the
history
of
the
fund
which
takes
an
interest
in
every
one
on
the
stage
be
he
actor
singer
dancer
or
workman
we
have
spent
more
than
during
the
past
year
charity
covers
a
multitude
of
sins
but
it
also
reveals
a
multitude
of
virtues
at
the
opening
of
the
former
fair
we
had
the
assistance
of
edwin
booth
and
joseph
jefferson
in
their
place
we
have
to
day
that
american
institution
and
apostle
of
wide
humanity
mark
twain
as
mr
frohman
has
said
charity
reveals
a
multitude
of
virtues
this
is
true
and
it
is
to
be
proved
here
before
the
week
is
over
mr
frohman
has
told
you
something
of
the
object
and
something
of
the
character
of
the
work
he
told
me
he
would
do
this
and
he
has
kept
his
word
i
had
expected
to
hear
of
it
through
the
newspapers
i
wouldn't
trust
anything
between
frohman
and
the
newspapers
except
when
it's
a
case
of
charity
you
should
all
remember
that
the
actor
has
been
your
benefactor
many
and
many
a
year
when
you
have
been
weary
and
downcast
he
has
lifted
your
heart
out
of
gloom
and
given
you
a
fresh
impulse
you
are
all
under
obligation
to
him
this
is
your
opportunity
to
be
his
benefactor
to
help
provide
for
him
in
his
old
age
and
when
he
suffers
from
infirmities
at
this
fair
no
one
is
to
be
persecuted
to
buy
if
you
offer
a
twenty
dollar
bill
in
payment
for
a
purchase
of
you
will
receive
in
change
there
is
to
be
no
robbery
here
there
is
to
be
no
creed
here
no
religion
except
charity
we
want
to
raise
and
that
is
a
great
task
to
attempt
the
president
has
set
the
fair
in
motion
by
pressing
the
button
in
washington
now
your
good
wishes
are
to
be
transmuted
into
cash
by
virtue
of
the
authority
in
me
vested
i
declare
the
fair
open
i
call
the
ball
game
let
the
transmuting
begin
russian
republic
the
american
auxiliary
movement
to
aid
the
cause
of
freedom
in
russia
was
launched
on
the
evening
of
april
at
the
club
a
house
fifth
avenue
with
mr
clemens
and
maxim
gorky
as
the
principal
spokesmen
mr
clemens
made
an
introductory
address
presenting
mr
gorky
if
we
can
build
a
russian
republic
to
give
to
the
persecuted
people
of
the
tsar's
domain
the
same
measure
of
freedom
that
we
enjoy
let
us
go
ahead
and
do
it
we
need
not
discuss
the
methods
by
which
that
purpose
is
to
be
attained
let
us
hope
that
fighting
will
be
postponed
or
averted
for
a
while
but
if
it
must
come
i
am
most
emphatically
in
sympathy
with
the
movement
now
on
foot
in
russia
to
make
that
country
free
i
am
certain
that
it
will
be
successful
as
it
deserves
to
be
any
such
movement
should
have
and
deserves
our
earnest
and
unanimous
co
operation
and
such
a
petition
for
funds
as
has
been
explained
by
mr
hunter
with
its
just
and
powerful
meaning
should
have
the
utmost
support
of
each
and
every
one
of
us
anybody
whose
ancestors
were
in
this
country
when
we
were
trying
to
free
ourselves
from
oppression
must
sympathize
with
those
who
now
are
trying
to
do
the
same
thing
in
russia
the
parallel
i
have
just
drawn
only
goes
to
show
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
oppression
is
bitter
or
not
men
with
red
warm
blood
in
their
veins
will
not
endure
it
but
will
seek
to
cast
it
off
if
we
keep
our
hearts
in
this
matter
russia
will
be
free
russian
sufferers
on
december
an
entertainment
was
given
at
the
casino
for
the
benefit
of
the
russian
sufferers
after
the
performance
mr
clemens
spoke
ladies
and
gentlemen
it
seems
a
sort
of
cruelty
to
inflict
upon
an
audience
like
this
our
rude
english
tongue
after
we
have
heard
that
divine
speech
flowing
in
that
lucid
gallic
tongue
it
has
always
been
a
marvel
to
me
that
french
language
it
has
always
been
a
puzzle
to
me
how
beautiful
that
language
is
how
expressive
it
seems
to
be
how
full
of
grace
it
is
and
when
it
comes
from
lips
like
those
how
eloquent
and
how
liquid
it
is
and
oh
i
am
always
deceived
i
always
think
i
am
going
to
understand
it
oh
it
is
such
a
delight
to
me
such
a
delight
to
me
to
meet
madame
bernhardt
and
laugh
hand
to
hand
and
heart
to
heart
with
her
i
have
seen
her
play
as
we
all
have
and
oh
that
is
divine
but
i
have
always
wanted
to
know
madame
bernhardt
herself
her
fiery
self
i
have
wanted
to
know
that
beautiful
character
why
she
is
the
youngest
person
i
ever
saw
except
myself
for
i
always
feel
young
when
i
come
in
the
presence
of
young
people
i
have
a
pleasant
recollection
of
an
incident
so
many
years
ago
when
madame
bernhardt
came
to
hartford
where
i
lived
and
she
was
going
to
play
and
the
tickets
were
three
dollars
and
there
were
two
lovely
women
a
widow
and
her
daughter
neighbors
of
ours
highly
cultivated
ladies
they
were
their
tastes
were
fine
and
elevated
but
they
were
very
poor
and
they
said
well
we
must
not
spend
six
dollars
on
a
pleasure
of
the
mind
a
pleasure
of
the
intellect
we
must
spend
it
if
it
must
go
at
all
to
furnish
to
somebody
bread
to
eat
and
so
they
sorrowed
over
the
fact
that
they
had
to
give
up
that
great
pleasure
of
seeing
madame
bernhardt
but
there
were
two
neighbors
equally
highly
cultivated
and
who
could
not
afford
bread
and
those
good
hearted
joneses
sent
that
six
dollars
deprived
themselves
of
it
and
sent
it
to
those
poor
smiths
to
buy
bread
with
and
those
smiths
took
it
and
bought
tickets
with
it
to
see
madame
bernhardt
oh
yes
some
people
have
tastes
and
intelligence
also
now
i
was
going
to
make
a
speech
i
supposed
i
was
but
i
am
not
it
is
late
late
and
so
i
am
going
to
tell
a
story
and
there
is
this
advantage
about
a
story
anyway
that
whatever
moral
or
valuable
thing
you
put
into
a
speech
why
it
gets
diffused
among
those
involuted
sentences
and
possibly
your
audience
goes
away
without
finding
out
what
that
valuable
thing
was
that
you
were
trying
to
confer
upon
it
but
dear
me
you
put
the
same
jewel
into
a
story
and
it
becomes
the
keystone
of
that
story
and
you
are
bound
to
get
it
it
flashes
it
flames
it
is
the
jewel
in
the
toad's
head
you
don't
overlook
that
now
if
i
am
going
to
talk
on
such
a
subject
as
for
instance
the
lost
opportunity
oh
the
lost
opportunity
anybody
in
this
house
who
has
reached
the
turn
of
life
sixty
or
seventy
or
even
fifty
or
along
there
when
he
goes
back
along
his
history
there
he
finds
it
mile
stoned
all
the
way
with
the
lost
opportunity
and
you
know
how
pathetic
that
is
you
younger
ones
cannot
know
the
full
pathos
that
lies
in
those
words
the
lost
opportunity
but
anybody
who
is
old
who
has
really
lived
and
felt
this
life
he
knows
the
pathos
of
the
lost
opportunity
now
i
will
tell
you
a
story
whose
moral
is
that
whose
lesson
is
that
whose
lament
is
that
i
was
in
a
village
which
is
a
suburb
of
new
bedford
several
years
ago
well
new
bedford
is
a
suburb
of
fair
haven
or
perhaps
it
is
the
other
way
in
any
case
it
took
both
of
those
towns
to
make
a
great
centre
of
the
great
whaling
industry
of
the
first
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
i
was
up
there
at
fair
haven
some
years
ago
with
a
friend
of
mine
there
was
a
dedication
of
a
great
town
hall
a
public
building
and
we
were
there
in
the
afternoon
this
great
building
was
filled
like
this
great
theatre
with
rejoicing
villagers
and
my
friend
and
i
started
down
the
centre
aisle
he
saw
a
man
standing
in
that
aisle
and
he
said
now
look
at
that
bronzed
veteran
at
that
mahogany
faced
man
now
tell
me
do
you
see
anything
about
that
man's
face
that
is
emotional
do
you
see
anything
about
it
that
suggests
that
inside
that
man
anywhere
there
are
fires
that
can
be
started
would
you
ever
imagine
that
that
is
a
human
volcano
why
no
i
said
i
would
not
he
looks
like
a
wooden
indian
in
front
of
a
cigar
store
very
well
said
my
friend
i
will
show
you
that
there
is
emotion
even
in
that
unpromising
place
i
will
just
go
to
that
man
and
i
will
just
mention
in
the
most
casual
way
an
incident
in
his
life
that
man
is
getting
along
toward
ninety
years
old
he
is
past
eighty
i
will
mention
an
incident
of
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
now
just
watch
the
effect
and
it
will
be
so
casual
that
if
you
don't
watch
you
won't
know
when
i
do
say
that
thing
but
you
just
watch
the
effect
he
went
on
down
there
and
accosted
this
antiquity
and
made
a
remark
or
two
i
could
not
catch
up
they
were
so
casual
i
could
not
recognize
which
one
it
was
that
touched
that
bottom
for
in
an
instant
that
old
man
was
literally
in
eruption
and
was
filling
the
whole
place
with
profanity
of
the
most
exquisite
kind
you
never
heard
such
accomplished
profanity
i
never
heard
it
also
delivered
with
such
eloquence
i
never
enjoyed
profanity
as
i
enjoyed
it
then
more
than
if
i
had
been
uttering
it
myself
there
is
nothing
like
listening
to
an
artist
all
his
passions
passing
away
in
lava
smoke
thunder
lightning
and
earthquake
then
this
friend
said
to
me
now
i
will
tell
you
about
that
about
sixty
years
ago
that
man
was
a
young
fellow
of
twenty
three
and
had
just
come
home
from
a
three
years
whaling
voyage
he
came
into
that
village
of
his
happy
and
proud
because
now
instead
of
being
chief
mate
he
was
going
to
be
master
of
a
whaleship
and
he
was
proud
and
happy
about
it
then
he
found
that
there
had
been
a
kind
of
a
cold
frost
come
upon
that
town
and
the
whole
region
roundabout
for
while
he
had
been
away
the
father
mathew
temperance
excitement
had
come
upon
the
whole
region
therefore
everybody
had
taken
the
pledge
there
wasn't
anybody
for
miles
and
miles
around
that
had
not
taken
the
pledge
so
you
can
see
what
a
solitude
it
was
to
this
young
man
who
was
fond
of
his
grog
and
he
was
just
an
outcast
because
when
they
found
he
would
not
join
father
mathew's
society
they
ostracized
him
and
he
went
about
that
town
three
weeks
day
and
night
in
utter
loneliness
the
only
human
being
in
the
whole
place
who
ever
took
grog
and
he
had
to
take
it
privately
if
you
don't
know
what
it
is
to
be
ostracized
to
be
shunned
by
your
fellow
man
may
you
never
know
it
then
he
recognized
that
there
was
something
more
valuable
in
this
life
than
grog
and
that
is
the
fellowship
of
your
fellow
man
and
at
last
he
gave
it
up
and
at
nine
o'clock
one
night
he
went
down
to
the
father
mathew
temperance
society
and
with
a
broken
heart
he
said
put
my
name
down
for
membership
in
this
society
and
then
he
went
away
crying
and
at
earliest
dawn
the
next
morning
they
came
for
him
and
routed
him
out
and
they
said
that
new
ship
of
his
was
ready
to
sail
on
a
three
years
voyage
in
a
minute
he
was
on
board
that
ship
and
gone
and
he
said
well
he
was
not
out
of
sight
of
that
town
till
he
began
to
repent
but
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
he
would
not
take
a
drink
and
so
that
whole
voyage
of
three
years
was
a
three
years
agony
to
that
man
because
he
saw
all
the
time
the
mistake
he
had
made
he
felt
it
all
through
he
had
constant
reminders
of
it
because
the
crew
would
pass
him
with
their
grog
come
out
on
the
deck
and
take
it
and
there
was
the
torturous
smell
of
it
he
went
through
the
whole
three
years
of
suffering
and
at
last
coming
into
port
it
was
snowy
it
was
cold
he
was
stamping
through
the
snow
two
feet
deep
on
the
deck
and
longing
to
get
home
and
there
was
his
crew
torturing
him
to
the
last
minute
with
hot
grog
but
at
last
he
had
his
reward
he
really
did
get
to
shore
at
last
and
jumped
and
ran
and
bought
a
jug
and
rushed
to
the
society's
office
and
said
to
the
secretary
take
my
name
off
your
membership
books
and
do
it
right
away
i
have
got
a
three
years
thirst
on
and
the
secretary
said
it
is
not
necessary
you
were

of
them

then
keep
still
and
give
him
a
chance
the
name
of
henry
watterson
carries
with
it
its
own
explanation
it
is
like
an
electric
light
on
top
of
madison
square
garden
you
touch
the
button
and
the
light
flashes
up
out
of
the
darkness
you
mention
the
name
of
henry
watterson
and
your
minds
are
at
once
illuminated
with
the
splendid
radiance
of
his
fame
and
achievements
a
journalist
a
soldier
an
orator
a
statesman
a
rebel
yes
he
was
a
rebel
and
better
still
now
he
is
a
reconstructed
rebel
it
is
a
curious
circumstance
a
circumstance
brought
about
without
any
collusion
or
prearrangement
that
he
and
i
both
of
whom
were
rebels
related
by
blood
to
each
other
should
be
brought
here
together
this
evening
bearing
a
tribute
in
our
hands
and
bowing
our
heads
in
reverence
to
that
noble
soul
who
for
three
years
we
tried
to
destroy
i
don't
know
as
the
fact
has
ever
been
mentioned
before
but
it
is
a
fact
nevertheless
colonel
watterson
and
i
were
both
rebels
and
we
are
blood
relations
i
was
a
second
lieutenant
in
a
confederate
company
for
a
while
oh
i
could
have
stayed
on
if
i
had
wanted
to
i
made
myself
felt
i
left
tracks
all
around
the
country
i
could
have
stayed
on
but
it
was
such
weather
i
never
saw
such
weather
to
be
out
of
doors
in
in
all
my
life
the
colonel
commanded
a
regiment
and
did
his
part
i
suppose
to
destroy
the
union
he
did
not
succeed
yet
if
he
had
obeyed
me
he
would
have
done
so
i
had
a
plan
and
i
fully
intended
to
drive
general
grant
into
the
pacific
ocean
if
i
could
get
transportation
i
told
colonel
watterson
about
it
i
told
him
what
he
had
to
do
what
i
wanted
him
to
do
was
to
surround
the
eastern
army
and
wait
until
i
came
up
but
he
was
insubordinate
he
stuck
on
some
quibble
of
military
etiquette
about
a
second
lieutenant
giving
orders
to
a
colonel
or
something
like
that
and
what
was
the
consequence
the
union
was
preserved
this
is
the
first
time
i
believe
that
that
secret
has
ever
been
revealed
no
one
outside
of
the
family
circle
i
think
knew
it
before
but
there
the
facts
are
watterson
saved
the
union
yes
he
saved
the
union
and
yet
there
he
sits
and
not
a
step
has
been
taken
or
a
movement
made
toward
granting
him
a
pension
that
is
the
way
things
are
done
it
is
a
case
where
some
blushing
ought
to
be
done
you
ought
to
blush
and
i
ought
to
blush
and
he
well
he's
a
little
out
of
practice
now
robert
fulton
fund
address
made
on
the
evening
of
april
mr
clemens
had
been
asked
to
address
the
association
by
gen
frederick
d
grant
president
he
was
offered
a
fee
of
but
refused
it
saying
i
shall
be
glad
to
do
it
but
i
must
stipulate
that
you
keep
the
and
add
it
to
the
memorial
fund
as
my
contribution
to
erect
a
monument
in
new
york
to
the
memory
of
the
man
who
applied
steam
to
navigation
at
this
meeting
mr
clemens
made
this
formal
announcement
from
the
platform
this
is
my
last
appearance
on
the
paid
platform
i
shall
not
retire
from
the
gratis
platform
until
i
am
buried
and
courtesy
will
compel
me
to
keep
still
and
not
disturb
the
others
now
since
i
must
i
shall
say
good
bye
i
see
many
faces
in
this
audience
well
known
to
me
they
are
all
my
friends
and
i
feel
that
those
i
don't
know
are
my
friends
too
i
wish
to
consider
that
you
represent
the
nation
and
that
in
saying
good
bye
to
you
i
am
saying
good
bye
to
the
nation
in
the
great
name
of
humanity
let
me
say
this
final
word
i
offer
an
appeal
in
behalf
of
that
vast
pathetic
multitude
of
fathers
mothers
and
helpless
little
children
they
were
sheltered
and
happy
two
days
ago
now
they
are
wandering
forlorn
hopeless
and
homeless
the
victims
of
a
great
disaster
so
i
beg
of
you
i
beg
of
you
to
open
your
hearts
and
open
your
purses
and
remember
san
francisco
the
smitten
city
i
wish
to
deliver
a
historical
address
i've
been
studying
the
history
of
er
a
let
me
see
a
he
stopped
in
confusion
and
walked
over
to
gen
fred
d
grant
who
sat
at
the
head
of
the
platform
he
leaned
over
in
a
whisper
and
then
returned
to
the
front
of
the
stage
and
oh
yes
i've
been
studying
robert
fulton
i've
been
studying
a
biographical
sketch
of
robert
fulton
the
inventor
of
er
a
let's
see
ah
yes
the
inventor
of
the
electric
telegraph
and
the
morse
sewing
machine
also
i
understand
he
invented
the
air
diria
pshaw
i
have
it
at
last
the
dirigible
balloon
yes
the
dirigible
but
it
is
a
difficult
word
and
i
don't
see
why
anybody
should
marry
a
couple
of
words
like
that
when
they
don't
want
to
be
married
at
all
and
are
likely
to
quarrel
with
each
other
all
the
time
i
should
put
that
couple
of
words
under
the
ban
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
under
its
decision
of
a
few
days
ago
and
take
em
out
and
drown
em
i
used
to
know
fulton
it
used
to
do
me
good
to
see
him
dashing
through
the
town
on
a
wild
broncho
and
fulton
was
born
in
er
a
well
it
doesn't
make
much
difference
where
he
was
born
does
it
i
remember
a
man
who
came
to
interview
me
once
to
get
a
sketch
of
my
life
i
consulted
with
a
friend
a
practical
man
before
he
came
to
know
how
i
should
treat
him
whenever
you
give
the
interviewer
a
fact
he
said
give
him
another
fact
that
will
contradict
it
then
he'll
go
away
with
a
jumble
that
he
can't
use
at
all
be
gentle
be
sweet
smile
like
an
idiot
just
be
natural
that's
what
my
friend
told
me
to
do
and
i
did
it
where
were
you
born
asked
the
interviewer
well
er
a
i
began
i
was
born
in
alabama
or
alaska
or
the
sandwich
islands
i
don't
know
where
but
right
around
there
somewhere
and
you
had
better
put
it
down
before
you
forget
it
but
you
weren't
born
in
all
those
places
he
said
well
i've
offered
you
three
places
take
your
choice
they're
all
at
the
same
price
how
old
are
you
he
asked
i
shall
be
nineteen
in
june
i
said
why
there's
such
a
discrepancy
between
your
age
and
your
looks
he
said
oh
that's
nothing
i
said
i
was
born
discrepantly
then
we
got
to
talking
about
my
brother
samuel
and
he
told
me
my
explanations
were
confusing
i
suppose
he
is
dead
i
said
some
said
that
he
was
dead
and
some
said
that
he
wasn't
did
you
bury
him
without
knowing
whether
he
was
dead
or
not
asked
the
reporter
there
was
a
mystery
said
i
we
were
twins
and
one
day
when
we
were
two
weeks
old
that
is
he
was
one
week
old
and
i
was
one
week
old
we
got
mixed
up
in
the
bath
tub
and
one
of
us
drowned
we
never
could
tell
which
one
of
us
had
a
strawberry
birthmark
on
the
back
of
his
hand
there
it
is
on
my
hand
this
is
the
one
that
was
drowned
there's
no
doubt
about
it
where's
the
mystery
he
said
why
don't
you
see
how
stupid
it
was
to
bury
the
wrong
twin
i
answered
i
didn't
explain
it
any
more
because
he
said
the
explanation
confused
him
to
me
it
is
perfectly
plain
but
to
get
back
to
fulton
i'm
going
along
like
an
old
man
i
used
to
know
who
used
to
start
to
tell
a
story
about
his
grandfather
he
had
an
awfully
retentive
memory
and
he
never
finished
the
story
because
he
switched
off
into
something
else
he
used
to
tell
about
how
his
grandfather
one
day
went
into
a
pasture
where
there
was
a
ram
the
old
man
dropped
a
silver
dime
in
the
grass
and
stooped
over
to
pick
it
up
the
ram
was
observing
him
and
took
the
old
man's
action
as
an
invitation
just
as
he
was
going
to
finish
about
the
ram
this
friend
of
mine
would
recall
that
his
grandfather
had
a
niece
who
had
a
glass
eye
she
used
to
loan
that
glass
eye
to
another
lady
friend
who
used
it
when
she
received
company
the
eye
didn't
fit
the
friend's
face
and
it
was
loose
and
whenever
she
winked
it
would
turn
over
then
he
got
on
the
subject
of
accidents
and
he
would
tell
a
story
about
how
he
believed
accidents
never
happened
there
was
an
irishman
coming
down
a
ladder
with
a
hod
of
bricks
he
said
and
a
dutchman
was
standing
on
the
ground
below
the
irishman
fell
on
the
dutchman
and
killed
him
accident
never
if
the
dutchman
hadn't
been
there
the
irishman
would
have
been
killed
why
didn't
the
irishman
fall
on
a
dog
which
was
next
to
the
dutchman
because
the
dog
would
have
seen
him
coming
then
he'd
get
off
from
the
dutchman
to
an
uncle
named
reginald
wilson
reginald
went
into
a
carpet
factory
one
day
and
got
twisted
into
the
machinery's
belt
he
went
excursioning
around
the
factory
until
he
was
properly
distributed
and
was
woven
into
sixty
nine
yards
of
the
best
three
ply
carpet
his
wife
bought
the
carpet
and
then
she
erected
a
monument
to
his
memory
it
read
sacred
to
the
memory
of
sixty
nine
yards
of
the
best
three
ply
carpet
containing
the
mortal
remainders
of
reginald
wilson
go
thou
and
do
likewise
and
so
on
he
would
ramble
about
telling
the
story
of
his
grandfather
until
we
never
were
told
whether
he
found
the
ten
cent
piece
or
whether
something
else
happened
fulton
day
jamestown
address
delivered
september
lieutenant
governor
ellyson
of
virginia
in
introducing
mr
clemens
said
the
people
have
come
here
to
bring
a
tribute
of
affectionate
recollection
for
the
man
who
has
contributed
so
much
to
the
progress
of
the
world
and
the
happiness
of
mankind
as
mr
clemens
came
down
to
the
platform
the
applause
became
louder
and
louder
until
mr
clemens
held
out
his
hand
for
silence
it
was
a
great
triumph
and
it
was
almost
a
minute
after
the
applause
ceased
before
mr
clemens
could
speak
he
attempted
it
once
and
when
the
audience
noticed
his
emotion
it
cheered
again
loudly
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
am
but
human
and
when
you
give
me
a
reception
like
that
i
am
obliged
to
wait
a
little
while
i
get
my
voice
when
you
appeal
to
my
head
i
don't
feel
it
but
when
you
appeal
to
my
heart
i
do
feel
it
we
are
here
to
celebrate
one
of
the
greatest
events
of
american
history
and
not
only
in
american
history
but
in
the
world's
history
indeed
it
was
the
application
of
steam
by
robert
fulton
it
was
a
world
event
there
are
not
many
of
them
it
is
peculiarly
an
american
event
that
is
true
but
the
influence
was
very
broad
in
effect
we
should
regard
this
day
as
a
very
great
american
holiday
we
have
not
many
that
are
exclusively
american
holidays
we
have
the
fourth
of
july
which
we
regard
as
an
american
holiday
but
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
i
am
waiting
for
a
dissenting
voice
all
great
efforts
that
led
up
to
the
fourth
of
july
were
made
not
by
americans
but
by
english
residents
of
america
subjects
of
the
king
of
england
they
fought
all
the
fighting
that
was
done
they
shed
and
spilt
all
the
blood
that
was
spilt
in
securing
to
us
the
invaluable
liberties
which
are
incorporated
in
the
declaration
of
independence
but
they
were
not
americans
they
signed
the
declaration
of
independence
no
american's
name
is
signed
to
that
document
at
all
there
never
was
an
american
such
as
you
and
i
are
until
after
the
revolution
when
it
had
all
been
fought
out
and
liberty
secured
after
the
adoption
of
the
constitution
and
the
recognition
of
the
independence
of
america
by
all
powers
while
we
revere
the
fourth
of
july
and
let
us
always
revere
it
and
the
liberties
it
conferred
upon
us
yet
it
was
not
an
american
event
a
great
american
day
it
was
an
american
who
applied
that
steam
successfully
there
are
not
a
great
many
world
events
and
we
have
our
full
share
the
telegraph
telephone
and
the
application
of
steam
to
navigation
these
are
great
american
events
to
day
i
have
been
requested
or
i
have
requested
myself
not
to
confine
myself
to
furnishing
you
with
information
but
to
remind
you
of
things
and
to
introduce
one
of
the
nation's
celebrants
admiral
harrington
here
is
going
to
tell
you
all
that
i
have
left
untold
i
am
going
to
tell
you
all
that
i
know
and
then
he
will
follow
up
with
such
rags
and
remnants
as
he
can
find
and
tell
you
what
he
knows
no
doubt
you
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
robert
fulton
and
the
influences
that
have
grown
from
his
invention
but
the
little
steamboat
is
suffering
neglect
you
probably
do
not
know
a
great
deal
about
that
boat
it
was
the
most
important
steamboat
in
the
world
i
was
there
and
saw
it
admiral
harrington
was
there
at
the
time
it
need
not
surprise
you
for
he
is
not
as
old
as
he
looks
that
little
boat
was
interesting
in
every
way
the
size
of
it
the
boat
was
one
he
said
ten
feet
long
the
breadth
of
that
boat
two
hundred
feet
you
see
the
first
and
most
important
detail
is
the
length
then
the
breadth
and
then
the
depth
the
depth
of
that
boat
was
the
admiral
says
it
was
a
flat
boat
then
her
tonnage
you
know
nothing
about
a
boat
until
you
know
two
more
things
her
speed
and
her
tonnage
we
know
the
speed
she
made
she
made
four
miles
and
sometimes
five
miles
it
was
on
her
initial
trip
on
august
that
she
made
her
initial
trip
when
she
went
from
jersey
city
to
chicago
that's
right
she
went
by
way
of
albany
now
comes
the
tonnage
of
that
boat
tonnage
of
a
boat
means
the
amount
of
displacement
displacement
means
the
amount
of
water
a
vessel
can
shove
in
a
day
the
tonnage
of
man
is
estimated
by
the
amount
of
whiskey
he
can
displace
in
a
day
robert
fulton
named
the
clermont
in
honor
of
his
bride
that
is
clermont
was
the
name
of
the
county
seat
i
feel
that
it
surprises
you
that
i
know
so
much
in
my
remarks
of
welcome
of
admiral
harrington
i
am
not
going
to
give
him
compliments
compliments
always
embarrass
a
man
you
do
not
know
anything
to
say
it
does
not
inspire
you
with
words
there
is
nothing
you
can
say
in
answer
to
a
compliment
i
have
been
complimented
myself
a
great
many
times
and
they
always
embarrass
me
i
always
feel
that
they
have
not
said
enough
the
admiral
and
myself
have
held
public
office
and
were
associated
together
a
great
deal
in
a
friendly
way
in
the
time
of
pocahontas
that
incident
where
pocahontas
saves
the
life
of
smith
from
her
father
powhatan's
club
was
gotten
up
by
the
admiral
and
myself
to
advertise
jamestown
at
that
time
the
admiral
and
myself
did
not
have
the
facilities
of
advertising
that
you
have
i
have
known
admiral
harrington
in
all
kinds
of
situations
in
public
service
on
the
platform
and
in
the
chain
gang
now
and
then
but
it
was
a
mistake
a
case
of
mistaken
identity
i
do
not
think
it
is
at
all
a
necessity
to
tell
you
admiral
harrington's
public
history
you
know
that
it
is
in
the
histories
i
am
not
here
to
tell
you
anything
about
his
public
life
but
to
expose
his
private
life
i
am
something
of
a
poet
when
the
great
poet
laureate
tennyson
died
and
i
found
that
the
place
was
open
i
tried
to
get
it
but
i
did
not
get
it
anybody
can
write
the
first
line
of
a
poem
but
it
is
a
very
difficult
task
to
make
the
second
line
rhyme
with
the
first
when
i
was
down
in
australia
there
were
two
towns
named
johnswood
and
par
am
i
made
this
rhyme
the
people
of
johnswood
are
pious
and
good
the
people
of
par
am
they
don't
care
a
i
do
not
want
to
compliment
admiral
harrington
but
as
long
as
such
men
as
he
devote
their
lives
to
the
public
service
the
credit
of
the
country
will
never
cease
i
will
say
that
the
same
high
qualities
the
same
moral
and
intellectual
attainments
the
same
graciousness
of
manner
of
conduct
of
observation
and
expression
have
caused
admiral
harrington
to
be
mistaken
for
me
and
i
have
been
mistaken
for
him
a
mutual
compliment
can
go
no
further
and
i
now
have
the
honor
and
privilege
of
introducing
to
you
admiral
harrington
lotos
club
dinner
in
honor
of
mark
twain
address
at
the
first
formal
dinner
in
the
new
club
house
november
in
introducing
the
guest
of
the
evening
mr
lawrence
said
to
night
the
old
faces
appear
once
more
amid
new
surroundings
the
place
where
last
we
met
about
the
table
has
vanished
and
to
night
we
have
our
first
lotos
dinner
in
a
home
that
is
all
our
own
it
is
peculiarly
fitting
that
the
board
should
now
be
spread
in
honor
of
one
who
has
been
a
member
of
the
club
for
full
a
score
of
years
and
it
is
a
happy
augury
for
the
future
that
our
fellow
member
whom
we
assemble
to
greet
should
be
the
bearer
of
a
most
distinguished
name
in
the
world
of
letters
for
the
lotos
club
is
ever
at
its
best
when
paying
homage
to
genius
in
literature
or
in
art
is
there
a
civilized
being
who
has
not
heard
the
name
of
mark
twain
we
knew
him
long
years
ago
before
he
came
out
of
the
boundless
west
brimful
of
wit
and
eloquence
with
no
reverence
for
anything
and
went
abroad
to
educate
the
untutored
european
in
the
subtleties
of
the
american
joke
the
world
has
looked
on
and
applauded
while
he
has
broken
many
images
he
has
led
us
in
imagination
all
over
the
globe
with
him
as
our
guide
we
have
traversed
alike
the
mississippi
and
the
sea
of
galilee
at
his
bidding
we
have
laughed
at
a
thousand
absurdities
by
a
laborious
process
of
reasoning
he
has
convinced
us
that
the
egyptian
mummies
are
actually
dead
he
has
held
us
spellbound
upon
the
plain
at
the
foot
of
the
great
sphinx
and
we
have
joined
him
in
weeping
bitter
tears
at
the
tomb
of
adam
to
night
we
greet
him
in
the
flesh
what
name
is
there
in
literature
that
can
be
likened
to
his
perhaps
some
of
the
distinguished
gentlemen
about
this
table
can
tell
us
but
i
know
of
none
himself
his
only
parallel
mr
president
gentlemen
and
fellow
members
of
the
lotos
club
i
have
seldom
in
my
lifetime
listened
to
compliments
so
felicitously
phrased
or
so
well
deserved
i
return
thanks
for
them
from
a
full
heart
and
an
appreciative
spirit
and
i
will
say
this
in
self
defence
while
i
am
charged
with
having
no
reverence
for
anything
i
wish
to
say
that
i
have
reverence
for
the
man
who
can
utter
such
truths
and
i
also
have
a
deep
reverence
and
a
sincere
one
for
a
club
that
can
do
such
justice
to
me
to
be
the
chief
guest
of
such
a
club
is
something
to
be
envied
and
if
i
read
your
countenances
rightly
i
am
envied
i
am
glad
to
see
this
club
in
such
palatial
quarters
i
remember
it
twenty
years
ago
when
it
was
housed
in
a
stable
now
when
i
was
studying
for
the
ministry
there
were
two
or
three
things
that
struck
my
attention
particularly
at
the
first
banquet
mentioned
in
history
that
other
prodigal
son
who
came
back
from
his
travels
was
invited
to
stand
up
and
have
his
say
they
were
all
there
his
brethren
david
and
goliath
and
er
and
if
he
had
had
such
experience
as
i
have
had
he
would
have
waited
until
those
other
people
got
through
talking
he
got
up
and
testified
to
all
his
failings
now
if
he
had
waited
before
telling
all
about
his
riotous
living
until
the
others
had
spoken
he
might
not
have
given
himself
away
as
he
did
and
i
think
that
i
would
give
myself
away
if
i
should
go
on
i
think
i'd
better
wait
until
the
others
hand
in
their
testimony
then
if
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
make
an
explanation
i
will
get
up
and
explain
and
if
i
cannot
do
that
i'll
deny
it
happened
later
in
the
evening
mr
clemens
made
another
speech
replying
to
a
fire
of
short
speeches
by
charles
dudley
warner
charles
a
dana
seth
low
general
porter
and
many
others
each
welcoming
the
guest
of
honor
i
don't
see
that
i
have
a
great
deal
to
explain
i
got
off
very
well
considering
the
opportunities
that
these
other
fellows
had
i
don't
see
that
mr
low
said
anything
against
me
and
neither
did
mr
dana
however
i
will
say
that
i
never
heard
so
many
lies
told
in
one
evening
as
were
told
by
mr
mckelway
and
i
consider
myself
very
capable
but
even
in
his
case
when
he
got
through
i
was
gratified
by
finding
how
much
he
hadn't
found
out
by
accident
he
missed
the
very
things
that
i
didn't
want
to
have
said
and
now
gentlemen
about
americanism
i
have
been
on
the
continent
of
europe
for
two
and
a
half
years
i
have
met
many
americans
there
some
sojourning
for
a
short
time
only
others
making
protracted
stays
and
it
has
been
very
gratifying
to
me
to
find
that
nearly
all
preserved
their
americanism
i
have
found
they
all
like
to
see
the
flag
fly
and
that
their
hearts
rise
when
they
see
the
stars
and
stripes
i
met
only
one
lady
who
had
forgotten
the
land
of
her
birth
and
glorified
monarchical
institutions
i
think
it
is
a
great
thing
to
say
that
in
two
and
a
half
years
i
met
only
one
person
who
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
shams
i
think
we
may
call
them
shams
of
nobilities
and
of
heredities
she
was
entirely
lost
in
them
after
i
had
listened
to
her
for
a
long
time
i
said
to
her
at
least
you
must
admit
that
we
have
one
merit
we
are
not
like
the
chinese
who
refuse
to
allow
their
citizens
who
are
tired
of
the
country
to
leave
it
thank
god
we
don't
copyright
with
mr
howells
edward
everett
hale
thomas
nelson
page
and
a
number
of
other
authors
mr
clemens
appeared
before
the
committee
december
the
new
copyright
bill
contemplated
an
author's
copyright
for
the
term
of
his
life
and
for
fifty
years
thereafter
applying
also
for
the
benefit
of
artists
musicians
and
others
but
the
authors
did
most
of
the
talking
f
d
millet
made
a
speech
for
the
artists
and
john
philip
sousa
for
the
musicians
mr
clemens
was
the
last
speaker
of
the
day
and
its
chief
feature
he
made
a
speech
the
serious
parts
of
which
created
a
strong
impression
and
the
humorous
parts
set
the
senators
and
representatives
in
roars
of
laughter
i
have
read
this
bill
at
least
i
have
read
such
portions
as
i
could
understand
nobody
but
a
practised
legislator
can
read
the
bill
and
thoroughly
understand
it
and
i
am
not
a
practised
legislator
i
am
interested
particularly
and
especially
in
the
part
of
the
bill
which
concerns
my
trade
i
like
that
extension
of
copyright
life
to
the
author's
life
and
fifty
years
afterward
i
think
that
would
satisfy
any
reasonable
author
because
it
would
take
care
of
his
children
let
the
grandchildren
take
care
of
themselves
that
would
take
care
of
my
daughters
and
after
that
i
am
not
particular
i
shall
then
have
long
been
out
of
this
struggle
independent
of
it
indifferent
to
it
it
isn't
objectionable
to
me
that
all
the
trades
and
professions
in
the
united
states
are
protected
by
the
bill
i
like
that
they
are
all
important
and
worthy
and
if
we
can
take
care
of
them
under
the
copyright
law
i
should
like
to
see
it
done
i
should
like
to
see
oyster
culture
added
and
anything
else
i
am
aware
that
copyright
must
have
a
limit
because
that
is
required
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
which
sets
aside
the
earlier
constitution
which
we
call
the
decalogue
the
decalogue
says
you
shall
not
take
away
from
any
man
his
profit
i
don't
like
to
be
obliged
to
use
the
harsh
term
what
the
decalogue
really
says
is
thou
shalt
not
steal
but
i
am
trying
to
use
more
polite
language
the
laws
of
england
and
america
do
take
it
away
do
select
but
one
class
the
people
who
create
the
literature
of
the
land
they
always
talk
handsomely
about
the
literature
of
the
land
always
what
a
fine
great
monumental
thing
a
great
literature
is
and
in
the
midst
of
their
enthusiasm
they
turn
around
and
do
what
they
can
to
discourage
it
i
know
we
must
have
a
limit
but
forty
two
years
is
too
much
of
a
limit
i
am
quite
unable
to
guess
why
there
should
be
a
limit
at
all
to
the
possession
of
the
product
of
a
man's
labor
there
is
no
limit
to
real
estate
doctor
hale
has
suggested
that
a
man
might
just
as
well
after
discovering
a
coal
mine
and
working
it
forty
two
years
have
the
government
step
in
and
take
it
away
what
is
the
excuse
it
is
that
the
author
who
produced
that
book
has
had
the
profit
of
it
long
enough
and
therefore
the
government
takes
a
profit
which
does
not
belong
to
it
and
generously
gives
it
to
the
of
people
but
it
doesn't
do
anything
of
the
kind
it
merely
takes
the
author's
property
takes
his
children's
bread
and
gives
the
publisher
double
profit
he
goes
on
publishing
the
book
and
as
many
of
his
confederates
as
choose
to
go
into
the
conspiracy
do
so
and
they
rear
families
in
affluence
and
they
continue
the
enjoyment
of
those
ill
gotten
gains
generation
after
generation
forever
for
they
never
die
in
a
few
weeks
or
months
or
years
i
shall
be
out
of
it
i
hope
under
a
monument
i
hope
i
shall
not
be
entirely
forgotten
and
i
shall
subscribe
to
the
monument
myself
but
i
shall
not
be
caring
what
happens
if
there
are
fifty
years
left
of
my
copyright
my
copyright
produces
annually
a
good
deal
more
than
i
can
use
but
my
children
can
use
it
i
can
get
along
i
know
a
lot
of
trades
but
that
goes
to
my
daughters
who
can't
get
along
as
well
as
i
can
because
i
have
carefully
raised
them
as
young
ladies
who
don't
know
anything
and
can't
do
anything
i
hope
congress
will
extend
to
them
the
charity
which
they
have
failed
to
get
from
me
why
if
a
man
who
is
not
even
mad
but
only
strenuous
strenuous
about
race
suicide
should
come
to
me
and
try
to
get
me
to
use
my
large
political
and
ecclesiastical
influence
to
get
a
bill
passed
by
this
congress
limiting
families
to
twenty
two
children
by
one
mother
i
should
try
to
calm
him
down
i
should
reason
with
him
i
should
say
to
him
leave
it
alone
leave
it
alone
and
it
will
take
care
of
itself
only
one
couple
a
year
in
the
united
states
can
reach
that
limit
if
they
have
reached
that
limit
let
them
go
right
on
let
them
have
all
the
liberty
they
want
in
restricting
that
family
to
twenty
two
children
you
are
merely
conferring
discomfort
and
unhappiness
on
one
family
per
year
in
a
nation
of
which
is
not
worth
while
it
is
the
very
same
with
copyright
one
author
per
year
produces
a
book
which
can
outlive
the
forty
two
year
limit
that's
all
this
nation
can't
produce
two
authors
a
year
that
can
do
it
the
thing
is
demonstrably
impossible
all
that
the
limited
copyright
can
do
is
to
take
the
bread
out
of
the
mouths
of
the
children
of
that
one
author
per
year
i
made
an
estimate
some
years
ago
when
i
appeared
before
a
committee
of
the
house
of
lords
that
we
had
published
in
this
country
since
the
declaration
of
independence
books
they
have
all
gone
they
had
all
perished
before
they
were
ten
years
old
it
is
only
one
book
in
that
can
outlive
the
forty
two
year
limit
therefore
why
put
a
limit
at
all
you
might
as
well
limit
the
family
to
twenty
two
children
if
you
recall
the
americans
in
the
nineteenth
century
who
wrote
books
that
lived
forty
two
years
you
will
have
to
begin
with
cooper
you
can
follow
with
washington
irving
harriet
beecher
stowe
edgar
allan
poe
and
there
you
have
to
wait
a
long
time
you
come
to
emerson
and
you
have
to
stand
still
and
look
further
you
find
howells
and
t
b
aldrich
and
then
your
numbers
begin
to
run
pretty
thin
and
you
question
if
you
can
name
twenty
persons
in
the
united
states
who
in
a
whole
century
have
written
books
that
would
live
forty
two
years
why
you
could
take
them
all
and
put
them
on
one
bench
there
add
the
wives
and
children
and
you
could
put
the
result
on
two
or
three
more
benches
one
hundred
persons
that
is
the
little
insignificant
crowd
whose
bread
and
butter
is
to
be
taken
away
for
what
purpose
for
what
profit
to
anybody
you
turn
these
few
books
into
the
hands
of
the
pirate
and
of
the
legitimate
publisher
too
and
they
get
the
profit
that
should
have
gone
to
the
wife
and
children
when
i
appeared
before
that
committee
of
the
house
of
lords
the
chairman
asked
me
what
limit
i
would
propose
i
said
perpetuity
i
could
see
some
resentment
in
his
manner
and
he
said
the
idea
was
illogical
for
the
reason
that
it
has
long
ago
been
decided
that
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
property
in
ideas
i
said
there
was
property
in
ideas
before
queen
anne's
time
they
had
perpetual
copyright
he
said
what
is
a
book
a
book
is
just
built
from
base
to
roof
on
ideas
and
there
can
be
no
property
in
it
i
said
i
wished
he
could
mention
any
kind
of
property
on
this
planet
that
had
a
pecuniary
value
which
was
not
derived
from
an
idea
or
ideas
he
said
real
estate
i
put
a
supposititious
case
a
dozen
englishmen
who
travel
through
south
africa
and
camp
out
and
eleven
of
them
see
nothing
at
all
they
are
mentally
blind
but
there
is
one
in
the
party
who
knows
what
this
harbor
means
and
what
the
lay
of
the
land
means
to
him
it
means
that
some
day
a
railway
will
go
through
here
and
there
on
that
harbor
a
great
city
will
spring
up
that
is
his
idea
and
he
has
another
idea
which
is
to
go
and
trade
his
last
bottle
of
scotch
whiskey
and
his
last
horse
blanket
to
the
principal
chief
of
that
region
and
buy
a
piece
of
land
the
size
of
pennsylvania
that
was
the
value
of
an
idea
that
the
day
would
come
when
the
cape
to
cairo
railway
would
be
built
every
improvement
that
is
put
upon
the
real
estate
is
the
result
of
an
idea
in
somebody's
head
the
skyscraper
is
another
idea
the
railroad
is
another
the
telephone
and
all
those
things
are
merely
symbols
which
represent
ideas
an
andiron
a
wash
tub
is
the
result
of
an
idea
that
did
not
exist
before
so
if
as
that
gentleman
said
a
book
does
consist
solely
of
ideas
that
is
the
best
argument
in
the
world
that
it
is
property
and
should
not
be
under
any
limitation
at
all
we
don't
ask
for
that
fifty
years
from
now
we
shall
ask
for
it
i
hope
the
bill
will
pass
without
any
deleterious
amendments
i
do
seem
to
be
extraordinarily
interested
in
a
whole
lot
of
arts
and
things
that
i
have
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
is
a
part
of
my
generous
liberal
nature
i
can't
help
it
i
feel
the
same
sort
of
charity
to
everybody
that
was
manifested
by
a
gentleman
who
arrived
at
home
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
from
the
club
and
was
feeling
so
perfectly
satisfied
with
life
so
happy
and
so
comfortable
and
there
was
his
house
weaving
weaving
weaving
around
he
watched
his
chance
and
by
and
by
when
the
steps
got
in
his
neighborhood
he
made
a
jump
and
climbed
up
and
got
on
the
portico
and
the
house
went
on
weaving
and
weaving
and
weaving
but
he
watched
the
door
and
when
it
came
around
his
way
he
plunged
through
it
he
got
to
the
stairs
and
when
he
went
up
on
all
fours
the
house
was
so
unsteady
that
he
could
hardly
make
his
way
but
at
last
he
got
to
the
top
and
raised
his
foot
and
put
it
on
the
top
step
but
only
the
toe
hitched
on
the
step
and
he
rolled
down
and
fetched
up
on
the
bottom
step
with
his
arm
around
the
newel
post
and
he
said
god
pity
the
poor
sailors
out
at
sea
on
a
night
like
this
in
aid
of
the
blind
address
at
a
public
meeting
of
the
new
york
association
for
promoting
the
interests
of
the
blind
at
the
waldorf
astoria
march
if
you
detect
any
awkwardness
in
my
movements
and
infelicities
in
my
conduct
i
will
offer
the
explanation
that
i
never
presided
at
a
meeting
of
any
kind
before
in
my
life
and
that
i
do
find
it
out
of
my
line
i
supposed
i
could
do
anything
anybody
else
could
but
i
recognize
that
experience
helps
and
i
do
feel
the
lack
of
that
experience
i
don't
feel
as
graceful
and
easy
as
i
ought
to
be
in
order
to
impress
an
audience
i
shall
not
pretend
that
i
know
how
to
umpire
a
meeting
like
this
and
i
shall
just
take
the
humble
place
of
the
essex
band
there
was
a
great
gathering
in
a
small
new
england
town
about
twenty
five
years
ago
i
remember
that
circumstance
because
there
was
something
that
happened
at
that
time
it
was
a
great
occasion
they
gathered
in
the
militia
and
orators
and
everybody
from
all
the
towns
around
it
was
an
extraordinary
occasion
the
little
local
paper
threw
itself
into
ecstasies
of
admiration
and
tried
to
do
itself
proud
from
beginning
to
end
it
praised
the
orators
the
militia
and
all
the
bands
that
came
from
everywhere
and
all
this
in
honest
country
newspaper
detail
but
the
writer
ran
out
of
adjectives
toward
the
end
having
exhausted
his
whole
magazine
of
praise
and
glorification
he
found
he
still
had
one
band
left
over
he
had
to
say
something
about
it
and
he
said
the
essex
band
done
the
best
it
could
i
am
an
essex
band
on
this
occasion
and
i
am
going
to
get
through
as
well
as
inexperience
and
good
intentions
will
enable
me
i
have
got
all
the
documents
here
necessary
to
instruct
you
in
the
objects
and
intentions
of
this
meeting
and
also
of
the
association
which
has
called
the
meeting
but
they
are
too
voluminous
i
could
not
pack
those
statistics
into
my
head
and
i
had
to
give
it
up
i
shall
have
to
just
reduce
all
that
mass
of
statistics
to
a
few
salient
facts
there
are
too
many
statistics
and
figures
for
me
i
never
could
do
anything
with
figures
never
had
any
talent
for
mathematics
never
accomplished
anything
in
my
efforts
at
that
rugged
study
and
to
day
the
only
mathematics
i
know
is
multiplication
and
the
minute
i
get
away
up
in
that
as
soon
as
i
reach
nine
times
seven
clemens
lapsed
into
deep
thought
for
a
moment
he
was
trying
to
figure
out
nine
times
seven
but
it
was
a
hopeless
task
and
he
turned
to
st
clair
mckelway
who
sat
near
him
mr
mckelway
whispered
the
answer
and
the
speaker
resumed
i've
got
it
now
it's
eighty
four
well
i
can
get
that
far
all
right
with
a
little
hesitation
after
that
i
am
uncertain
and
i
can't
manage
a
statistic
this
association
for
the
clemens
was
in
another
dilemma
again
he
was
obliged
to
turn
to
mr
mckelway
oh
yes
for
promoting
the
interests
of
the
blind
it's
a
long
name
if
i
could
i
would
write
it
out
for
you
and
let
you
take
it
home
and
study
it
but
i
don't
know
how
to
spell
it
and
mr
carnegie
is
down
in
virginia
somewhere
well
anyway
the
object
of
that
association
which
has
been
recently
organized
five
months
ago
in
fact
is
in
the
hands
of
very
very
energetic
intelligent
and
capable
people
and
they
will
push
it
to
success
very
surely
and
all
the
more
surely
if
you
will
give
them
a
little
of
your
assistance
out
of
your
pockets
the
intention
the
purpose
is
to
search
out
all
the
blind
and
find
work
for
them
to
do
so
that
they
may
earn
their
own
bread
now
it
is
dismal
enough
to
be
blind
it
is
dreary
dreary
life
at
best
but
it
can
be
largely
ameliorated
by
finding
something
for
these
poor
blind
people
to
do
with
their
hands
the
time
passes
so
heavily
that
it
is
never
day
or
night
with
them
it
is
always
night
and
when
they
have
to
sit
with
folded
hands
and
with
nothing
to
do
to
amuse
or
entertain
or
employ
their
minds
it
is
drearier
and
drearier
and
then
the
knowledge
they
have
that
they
must
subsist
on
charity
and
so
often
reluctant
charity
it
would
renew
their
lives
if
they
could
have
something
to
do
with
their
hands
and
pass
their
time
and
at
the
same
time
earn
their
bread
and
know
the
sweetness
of
the
bread
which
is
the
result
of
the
labor
of
one's
own
hands
they
need
that
cheer
and
pleasure
it
is
the
only
way
you
can
turn
their
night
into
day
to
give
them
happy
hearts
the
only
thing
you
can
put
in
the
place
of
the
blessed
sun
that
you
can
do
in
the
way
i
speak
of
blind
people
generally
who
have
seen
the
light
know
what
it
is
to
miss
the
light
those
who
have
gone
blind
since
they
were
twenty
years
old
their
lives
are
unendingly
dreary
but
they
can
be
taught
to
use
their
hands
and
to
employ
themselves
at
a
great
many
industries
that
association
from
which
this
draws
its
birth
in
cambridge
massachusetts
has
taught
its
blind
to
make
many
things
they
make
them
better
than
most
people
and
more
honest
than
people
who
have
the
use
of
their
eyes
the
goods
they
make
are
readily
salable
people
like
them
and
so
they
are
supporting
themselves
and
it
is
a
matter
of
cheer
cheer
they
pass
their
time
now
not
too
irksomely
as
they
formerly
did
what
this
association
needs
and
wants
is
the
figures
are
set
down
and
what
the
money
is
for
and
there
is
no
graft
in
it
or
i
would
not
be
here
and
they
hope
to
beguile
that
out
of
your
pockets
and
you
will
find
affixed
to
the
programme
an
opportunity
that
little
blank
which
you
will
fill
out
and
promise
so
much
money
now
or
to
morrow
or
some
time
then
there
is
another
opportunity
which
is
still
better
and
that
is
that
you
shall
subscribe
an
annual
sum
i
have
invented
a
good
many
useful
things
in
my
time
but
never
anything
better
than
that
of
getting
money
out
of
people
who
don't
want
to
part
with
it
it
is
always
for
good
objects
of
course
this
is
the
plan
when
you
call
upon
a
person
to
contribute
to
a
great
and
good
object
and
you
think
he
should
furnish
about
he
disappoints
you
as
like
as
not
much
the
best
way
to
work
him
to
supply
that
thousand
dollars
is
to
split
it
into
parts
and
contribute
say
a
hundred
dollars
a
year
or
fifty
or
whatever
the
sum
maybe
let
him
contribute
ten
or
twenty
a
year
he
doesn't
feel
that
but
he
does
feel
it
when
you
call
upon
him
to
contribute
a
large
amount
when
you
get
used
to
it
you
would
rather
contribute
than
borrow
money
i
tried
it
in
helen
keller's
case
mr
hutton
wrote
me
in
or
when
i
was
in
london
and
said
the
gentleman
who
has
been
so
liberal
in
taking
care
of
helen
keller
has
died
without
making
provision
for
her
in
his
will
and
now
they
don't
know
what
to
do
they
were
proposing
to
raise
a
fund
and
he
thought
enough
to
furnish
an
income
of
or
a
year
for
the
support
of
that
wonderful
girl
and
her
wonderful
teacher
miss
sullivan
now
mrs
macy
i
wrote
to
mr
hutton
and
said
go
on
get
up
your
fund
it
will
be
slow
but
if
you
want
quick
work
i
propose
this
system
the
system
i
speak
of
of
asking
people
to
contribute
such
and
such
a
sum
from
year
to
year
and
drop
out
whenever
they
please
and
he
would
find
there
wouldn't
be
any
difficulty
people
wouldn't
feel
the
burden
of
it
and
he
wrote
back
saying
he
had
raised
the
a
year
indefinitely
by
that
system
in
a
single
afternoon
we
would
like
to
do
something
just
like
that
to
night
we
will
take
as
many
checks
as
you
care
to
give
you
can
leave
your
donations
in
the
big
room
outside
i
knew
once
what
it
was
to
be
blind
i
shall
never
forget
that
experience
i
have
been
as
blind
as
anybody
ever
was
for
three
or
four
hours
and
the
sufferings
that
i
endured
and
the
mishaps
and
the
accidents
that
are
burning
in
my
memory
make
my
sympathy
rise
when
i
feel
for
the
blind
and
always
shall
feel
i
once
went
to
heidelberg
on
an
excursion
i
took
a
clergyman
along
with
me
the
rev
joseph
twichell
of
hartford
who
is
still
among
the
living
despite
that
fact
i
always
travel
with
clergymen
when
i
can
it
is
better
for
them
it
is
better
for
me
and
any
preacher
who
goes
out
with
me
in
stormy
weather
and
without
a
lightning
rod
is
a
good
one
the
reverend
twichell
is
one
of
those
people
filled
with
patience
and
endurance
two
good
ingredients
for
a
man
travelling
with
me
so
we
got
along
very
well
together
in
that
old
town
they
have
not
altered
a
house
nor
built
one
in
years
we
went
to
the
inn
and
they
placed
twichell
and
me
in
a
most
colossal
bedroom
the
largest
i
ever
saw
or
heard
of
it
was
as
big
as
this
room
i
didn't
take
much
notice
of
the
place
i
didn't
really
get
my
bearings
i
noticed
twichell
got
a
german
bed
about
two
feet
wide
the
kind
in
which
you've
got
to
lie
on
your
edge
because
there
isn't
room
to
lie
on
your
back
and
he
was
way
down
south
in
that
big
room
and
i
was
way
up
north
at
the
other
end
of
it
with
a
regular
sahara
in
between
we
went
to
bed
twichell
went
to
sleep
but
then
he
had
his
conscience
loaded
and
it
was
easy
for
him
to
get
to
sleep
i
couldn't
get
to
sleep
it
was
one
of
those
torturing
kinds
of
lovely
summer
nights
when
you
hear
various
kinds
of
noises
now
and
then
a
mouse
away
off
in
the
southwest
you
throw
things
at
the
mouse
that
encourages
the
mouse
but
i
couldn't
stand
it
and
about
two
o'clock
i
got
up
and
thought
i
would
give
it
up
and
go
out
in
the
square
where
there
was
one
of
those
tinkling
fountains
and
sit
on
its
brink
and
dream
full
of
romance
i
got
out
of
bed
and
i
ought
to
have
lit
a
candle
but
i
didn't
think
of
it
until
it
was
too
late
it
was
the
darkest
place
that
ever
was
there
has
never
been
darkness
any
thicker
than
that
it
just
lay
in
cakes
i
thought
that
before
dressing
i
would
accumulate
my
clothes
i
pawed
around
in
the
dark
and
found
everything
packed
together
on
the
floor
except
one
sock
i
couldn't
get
on
the
track
of
that
sock
it
might
have
occurred
to
me
that
maybe
it
was
in
the
wash
but
i
didn't
think
of
that
i
went
excursioning
on
my
hands
and
knees
presently
i
thought
i
am
never
going
to
find
it
i'll
go
back
to
bed
again
that
is
what
i
tried
to
do
during
the
next
three
hours
i
had
lost
the
bearings
of
that
bed
i
was
going
in
the
wrong
direction
all
the
time
by
and
by
i
came
in
collision
with
a
chair
and
that
encouraged
me
it
seemed
to
me
as
far
as
i
could
recollect
there
was
only
a
chair
here
and
there
and
yonder
five
or
six
of
them
scattered
over
this
territory
and
i
thought
maybe
after
i
found
that
chair
i
might
find
the
next
one
well
i
did
and
i
found
another
and
another
and
another
i
kept
going
around
on
my
hands
and
knees
having
those
sudden
collisions
and
finally
when
i
banged
into
another
chair
i
almost
lost
my
temper
and
i
raised
up
garbed
as
i
was
not
for
public
exhibition
right
in
front
of
a
mirror
fifteen
or
sixteen
feet
high
i
hadn't
noticed
the
mirror
didn't
know
it
was
there
and
when
i
saw
myself
in
the
mirror
i
was
frightened
out
of
my
wits
i
don't
allow
any
ghosts
to
bite
me
and
i
took
up
a
chair
and
smashed
at
it
a
million
pieces
then
i
reflected
that's
the
way
i
always
do
and
it's
unprofitable
unless
a
man
has
had
much
experience
that
way
and
has
clear
judgment
and
i
had
judgment
and
i
would
have
had
to
pay
for
that
mirror
if
i
hadn't
recollected
to
say
it
was
twichell
who
broke
it
then
i
got
down
on
my
hands
and
knees
and
went
on
another
exploring
expedition
as
far
as
i
could
remember
there
were
six
chairs
in
that
oklahoma
and
one
table
a
great
big
heavy
table
not
a
good
table
to
hit
with
your
head
when
rushing
madly
along
in
the
course
of
time
i
collided
with
thirty
five
chairs
and
tables
enough
to
stock
that
dining
room
out
there
it
was
a
hospital
for
decayed
furniture
and
it
was
in
a
worse
condition
when
i
got
through
with
it
i
went
on
and
on
and
at
last
got
to
a
place
where
i
could
feel
my
way
up
and
there
was
a
shelf
i
knew
that
wasn't
in
the
middle
of
the
room
up
to
that
time
i
was
afraid
i
had
gotten
out
of
the
city
i
was
very
careful
and
pawed
along
that
shelf
and
there
was
a
pitcher
of
water
about
a
foot
high
and
it
was
at
the
head
of
twichell's
bed
but
i
didn't
know
it
i
felt
that
pitcher
going
and
i
grabbed
at
it
but
it
didn't
help
any
and
came
right
down
in
twichell's
face
and
nearly
drowned
him
but
it
woke
him
up
i
was
grateful
to
have
company
on
any
terms
he
lit
a
match
and
there
i
was
way
down
south
when
i
ought
to
have
been
back
up
yonder
my
bed
was
out
of
sight
it
was
so
far
away
you
needed
a
telescope
to
find
it
twichell
comforted
me
and
i
scrubbed
him
off
and
we
got
sociable
but
that
night
wasn't
wasted
i
had
my
pedometer
on
my
leg
twichell
and
i
were
in
a
pedometer
match
twichell
had
longer
legs
than
i
the
only
way
i
could
keep
up
was
to
wear
my
pedometer
to
bed
i
always
walk
in
my
sleep
and
on
this
occasion
i
gained
sixteen
miles
on
him
after
all
i
never
found
that
sock
i
never
have
seen
it
from
that
day
to
this
but
that
adventure
taught
me
what
it
is
to
be
blind
that
was
one
of
the
most
serious
occasions
of
my
whole
life
yet
i
never
can
speak
of
it
without
somebody
thinking
it
isn't
serious
you
try
it
and
see
how
serious
it
is
to
be
as
the
blind
are
and
i
was
that
night
clemens
read
several
letters
of
regret
he
then
introduced
joseph
h
choate
saying
it
is
now
my
privilege
to
present
to
you
mr
choate
i
don't
have
to
really
introduce
him
i
don't
have
to
praise
him
or
to
flatter
him
i
could
say
truly
that
in
the
forty
seven
years
i
have
been
familiarly
acquainted
with
him
he
has
always
been
the
handsomest
man
america
has
ever
produced
and
i
hope
and
believe
he
will
hold
the
belt
forty
five
years
more
he
has
served
his
country
ably
faithfully
and
brilliantly
he
stands
at
the
summit
at
the
very
top
in
the
esteem
and
regard
of
his
countrymen
and
if
i
could
say
one
word
which
would
lift
him
any
higher
in
his
countrymen's
esteem
and
affection
i
would
say
that
word
whether
it
was
true
or
not

address
at
the
annual
dinner
of
the
new
york
post
graduate
medical
school
and
hospital
january
the
president
dr
george
n
miller
in
introducing
mr
clemens
referred
to
his
late
experience
with
burglars
gentlemen
and
doctors
i
am
glad
to
be
among
my
own
kind
to
night
i
was
once
a
sharpshooter
but
now
i
practise
a
much
higher
and
equally
as
deadly
a
profession
it
wasn't
so
very
long
ago
that
i
became
a
member
of
your
cult
and
for
the
time
i've
been
in
the
business
my
record
is
one
that
can't
be
scoffed
at
as
to
the
burglars
i
am
perfectly
familiar
with
these
people
i
have
always
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
burglars
not
officially
but
through
their
attentions
to
me
i
never
suffered
anything
at
the
hands
of
a
burglar
they
have
invaded
my
house
time
and
time
again
they
never
got
anything
then
those
people
who
burglarized
our
house
in
september
we
got
back
the
plated
ware
they
took
off
we
jailed
them
and
i
have
been
sorry
ever
since
they
did
us
a
great
service
they
scared
off
all
the
servants
in
the
place
i
consider
the
children's
theatre
of
which
i
am
president
and
the
post
graduate
medical
school
as
the
two
greatest
institutions
in
the
country
this
school
in
bringing
its
twenty
thousand
physicians
from
all
parts
of
the
country
bringing
them
up
to
date
and
sending
them
back
with
renewed
confidence
has
surely
saved
hundreds
of
thousands
of
lives
which
otherwise
would
have
been
lost
i
have
been
practising
now
for
seven
months
when
i
settled
on
my
farm
in
connecticut
in
june
i
found
the
community
very
thinly
settled
and
since
i
have
been
engaged
in
practice
it
has
become
more
thinly
settled
still
this
gratifies
me
as
indicating
that
i
am
making
an
impression
on
my
community
i
suppose
it
is
the
same
with
all
of
you
i
have
always
felt
that
i
ought
to
do
something
for
you
and
so
i
organized
a
redding
connecticut
branch
of
the
post
graduate
school
i
am
only
a
country
farmer
up
there
but
i
am
doing
the
best
i
can
of
course
the
practice
of
medicine
and
surgery
in
a
remote
country
district
has
its
disadvantages
but
in
my
case
i
am
happy
in
a
division
of
responsibility
i
practise
in
conjunction
with
a
horse
doctor
a
sexton
and
an
undertaker
the
combination
is
air
tight
and
once
a
man
is
stricken
in
our
district
escape
is
impossible
for
him
these
four
of
us
three
in
the
regular
profession
and
the
fourth
an
undertaker
are
all
good
men
there
is
bill
ferguson
the
redding
undertaker
bill
is
there
in
every
respect
he
is
a
little
lukewarm
on
general
practice
and
writes
his
name
with
a
rubber
stamp
like
my
old
southern
friend
he
is
one
of
the
finest
planters
anywhere
then
there
is
jim
ruggles
the
horse
doctor
ruggles
is
one
of
the
best
men
i
have
got
he
also
is
not
much
on
general
medicine
but
he
is
a
fine
horse
doctor
ferguson
doesn't
make
any
money
off
him
you
see
the
combination
started
this
way
when
i
got
up
to
redding
and
had
become
a
doctor
i
looked
around
to
see
what
my
chances
were
for
aiding
in
the
great
work
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
determine
what
manner
of
doctor
i
was
to
be
being
a
connecticut
farmer
i
naturally
consulted
my
farmacopia
and
at
once
decided
to
become
a
farmeopath
then
i
got
circulating
about
and
got
in
touch
with
ferguson
and
ruggles
ferguson
joined
readily
in
my
ideas
but
ruggles
kept
saying
that
while
it
was
all
right
for
an
undertaker
to
get
aboard
he
couldn't
see
where
it
helped
horses
well
we
started
to
find
out
what
was
the
trouble
with
the
community
and
it
didn't
take
long
to
find
out
that
there
was
just
one
disease
and
that
was
race
suicide
and
driving
about
the
country
side
i
was
told
by
my
fellow
farmers
that
it
was
the
only
rational
human
and
valuable
disease
but
it
is
cutting
into
our
profits
so
that
we'll
either
have
to
stop
it
or
we'll
have
to
move
we've
had
some
funny
experiences
up
there
in
redding
not
long
ago
a
fellow
came
along
with
a
rolling
gait
and
a
distressed
face
we
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
we
always
hold
consultations
on
every
case
as
there
isn't
business
enough
for
four
he
said
he
didn't
know
but
that
he
was
a
sailor
and
perhaps
that
might
help
us
to
give
a
diagnosis
we
treated
him
for
that
and
i
never
saw
a
man
die
more
peacefully
that
same
afternoon
my
dog
tige
treed
an
african
gentleman
we
chained
up
the
dog
and
then
the
gentleman
came
down
and
said
he
had
appendicitis
we
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
be
cut
open
and
he
said
yes
that
he'd
like
to
know
if
there
was
anything
in
it
so
we
cut
him
open
and
found
nothing
in
him
but
darkness
so
we
diagnosed
his
case
as
infidelity
because
he
was
dark
inside
tige
is
a
very
clever
dog
and
aids
us
greatly
the
other
day
a
patient
came
to
me
and
inquired
if
i
was
old
doctor
clemens
as
a
practitioner
i
have
given
a
great
deal
of
my
attention
to
bright's
disease
i
have
made
some
rules
for
treating
it
that
may
be
valuable
listen
rule
when
approaching
the
bedside
of
one
whom
an
all
wise
president
i
mean
an
all
wise
providence
well
anyway
it's
the
same
thing
has
seen
fit
to
afflict
with
disease
well
the
rule
is
simple
even
if
it
is
old
fashioned
rule
i've
forgotten
just
what
it
is
but
rule
this
is
always
indispensable

missouri
university
speech
address
delivered
june
at
columbia
mo
when
the
name
of
samuel
l
clemens
was
called
the
humorist
stepped
forward
put
his
hand
to
his
hair
and
apparently
hesitated
there
was
a
dead
silence
for
a
moment
suddenly
the
entire
audience
rose
and
stood
in
silence
some
one
began
to
spell
out
the
word
missouri
with
an
interval
between
the
letters
all
joined
in
then
the
house
again
became
silent
mr
clemens
broke
the
spell
as
you
are
all
standing
drawled
in
his
characteristic
i
guess
i
suppose
i
had
better
stand
too
came
a
laugh
and
loud
cries
for
a
speech
as
the
great
humorist
spoke
of
his
recent
visit
to
hannibal
his
old
home
his
voice
trembled
you
cannot
know
what
a
strain
it
was
on
my
emotions
in
fact
when
i
found
myself
shaking
hands
with
persons
i
had
not
seen
for
fifty
years
and
looking
into
wrinkled
faces
that
were
so
young
and
joyous
when
i
last
saw
them
i
experienced
emotions
that
i
had
never
expected
and
did
not
know
were
in
me
i
was
profoundly
moved
and
saddened
to
think
that
this
was
the
last
time
perhaps
that
i
would
ever
behold
those
kind
old
faces
and
dear
old
scenes
of
childhood
humorist
then
changed
to
a
lighter
mood
and
for
a
time
the
audience
was
in
a
continual
roar
of
laughter
he
was
particularly
amused
at
the
eulogy
on
himself
read
by
gardiner
lathrop
in
conferring
the
degree
he
has
a
fine
opportunity
to
distinguish
himself
mr
by
telling
the
truth
about
me
i
have
seen
it
stated
in
print
that
as
a
boy
i
had
been
guilty
of
stealing
peaches
apples
and
watermelons
i
read
a
story
to
this
effect
very
closely
not
long
ago
and
i
was
convinced
of
one
thing
which
was
that
the
man
who
wrote
it
was
of
the
opinion
that
it
was
wrong
to
steal
and
that
i
had
not
acted
right
in
doing
so
i
wish
now
however
to
make
an
honest
statement
which
is
that
i
do
not
believe
in
all
my
checkered
career
i
stole
a
ton
of
peaches
one
night
i
stole
i
mean
i
removed
a
watermelon
from
a
wagon
while
the
owner
was
attending
to
another
customer
i
crawled
off
to
a
secluded
spot
where
i
found
that
it
was
green
it
was
the
greenest
melon
in
the
mississippi
valley
then
i
began
to
reflect
i
began
to
be
sorry
i
wondered
what
george
washington
would
have
done
had
he
been
in
my
place
i
thought
a
long
time
and
then
suddenly
felt
that
strange
feeling
which
comes
to
a
man
with
a
good
resolution
and
i
took
up
that
watermelon
and
took
it
back
to
its
owner
i
handed
him
the
watermelon
and
told
him
to
reform
he
took
my
lecture
much
to
heart
and
when
he
gave
me
a
good
one
in
place
of
the
green
melon
i
forgave
him
i
told
him
that
i
would
still
be
a
customer
of
his
and
that
i
cherished
no
ill
feeling
because
of
the
incident
that
would
remain
green
in
my
memory
business
the
alumni
of
eastman
college
gave
their
annual
banquet
march
at
the
y
m
c
a
building
mr
james
g
cannon
of
the
fourth
national
bank
made
the
first
speech
of
the
evening
after
which
mr
clemens
was
introduced
by
mr
bailey
as
the
personal
friend
of
tom
sawyer
who
was
one
of
the
types
of
successful
business
men
mr
cannon
has
furnished
me
with
texts
enough
to
last
as
slow
a
speaker
as
myself
all
the
rest
of
the
night
i
took
exception
to
the
introducing
of
mr
cannon
as
a
great
financier
as
if
he
were
the
only
great
financier
present
i
am
a
financier
but
my
methods
are
not
the
same
as
mr
cannon's
i
cannot
say
that
i
have
turned
out
the
great
business
man
that
i
thought
i
was
when
i
began
life
but
i
am
comparatively
young
yet
and
may
learn
i
am
rather
inclined
to
believe
that
what
troubled
me
was
that
i
got
the
big
head
early
in
the
game
i
want
to
explain
to
you
a
few
points
of
difference
between
the
principles
of
business
as
i
see
them
and
those
that
mr
cannon
believes
in
he
says
that
the
primary
rule
of
business
success
is
loyalty
to
your
employer
that's
all
right
as
a
theory
what
is
the
matter
with
loyalty
to
yourself
as
nearly
as
i
can
understand
mr
cannon's
methods
there
is
one
great
drawback
to
them
he
wants
you
to
work
a
great
deal
diligence
is
a
good
thing
but
taking
things
easy
is
much
more
restful
my
idea
is
that
the
employer
should
be
the
busy
man
and
the
employee
the
idle
one
the
employer
should
be
the
worried
man
and
the
employee
the
happy
one
and
why
not
he
gets
the
salary
my
plan
is
to
get
another
man
to
do
the
work
for
me
in
that
there's
more
repose
what
i
want
is
repose
first
last
and
all
the
time
mr
cannon
says
that
there
are
three
cardinal
rules
of
business
success
they
are
diligence
honesty
and
truthfulness
well
diligence
is
all
right
let
it
go
as
a
theory
honesty
is
the
best
policy
when
there
is
money
in
it
but
truthfulness
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
why
this
man
is
misleading
you
i
had
an
experience
to
day
with
my
wife
which
illustrates
this
i
was
acknowledging
a
belated
invitation
to
another
dinner
for
this
evening
which
seemed
to
have
been
sent
about
ten
days
ago
it
only
reached
me
this
morning
i
was
mortified
at
the
discourtesy
into
which
i
had
been
brought
by
this
delay
and
wondered
what
was
being
thought
of
me
by
my
hosts
as
i
had
accepted
your
invitation
of
course
i
had
to
send
regrets
to
my
other
friends
when
i
started
to
write
this
note
my
wife
came
up
and
stood
looking
over
my
shoulder
women
always
want
to
know
what
is
going
on
said
she
should
not
that
read
in
the
third
person
i
conceded
that
it
should
put
aside
what
i
was
writing
and
commenced
over
again
that
seemed
to
satisfy
her
and
so
she
sat
down
and
let
me
proceed
i
then
finished
my
first
note
and
so
sent
what
i
intended
i
never
could
have
done
this
if
i
had
let
my
wife
know
the
truth
about
it
here
is
what
i
wrote
to
the
ohio
society
i
have
at
this
moment
received
a
most
kind
invitation
eleven
days
old
from
mr
southard
president
and
a
like
one
ten
days
old
from
mr
bryant
president
of
the
press
club
i
thank
the
society
cordially
for
the
compliment
of
these
invitations
although
i
am
booked
elsewhere
and
cannot
come
but
oh
i
should
like
to
know
the
name
of
the
lightning
express
by
which
they
were
forwarded
for
i
owe
a
friend
a
dozen
chickens
and
i
believe
it
will
be
cheaper
to
send
eggs
instead
and
let
them
develop
on
the
road
sincerely
yours
mark
twain
i
want
to
tell
you
of
some
of
my
experiences
in
business
and
then
i
will
be
in
a
position
to
lay
down
one
general
rule
for
the
guidance
of
those
who
want
to
succeed
in
business
my
first
effort
was
about
twenty
five
years
ago
i
took
hold
of
an
invention
i
don't
know
now
what
it
was
all
about
but
some
one
came
to
me
and
told
me
it
was
a
good
thing
and
that
there
was
lots
of
money
in
it
he
persuaded
me
to
invest
and
i
lived
up
to
my
beliefs
by
engaging
a
man
to
develop
it
to
make
a
long
story
short
i
sunk
in
it
then
i
took
up
the
publication
of
a
book
i
called
in
a
publisher
and
said
to
him
i
want
you
to
publish
this
book
along
lines
which
i
shall
lay
down
i
am
the
employer
and
you
are
the
employee
i
am
going
to
show
them
some
new
kinks
in
the
publishing
business
and
i
want
you
to
draw
on
me
for
money
as
you
go
along
which
he
did
he
drew
on
me
for
then
i
asked
him
to
take
the
book
and
call
it
off
but
he
refused
to
do
that
my
next
venture
was
with
a
machine
for
doing
something
or
other
i
knew
less
about
that
than
i
did
about
the
invention
but
i
sunk
in
the
business
and
i
can't
for
the
life
of
me
recollect
what
it
was
the
machine
was
to
do
i
was
still
undismayed
you
see
one
of
the
strong
points
about
my
business
life
was
that
i
never
gave
up
i
undertook
to
publish
general
grant's
book
and
made
in
six
months
my
axiom
is
to
succeed
in
business
avoid
my
example
carnegie
the
benefactor
at
the
dinner
given
in
honor
of
andrew
carnegie
by
the
lotos
club
march
mr
clemens
appeared
in
a
white
suit
from
head
to
feet
he
wore
a
white
double
breasted
coat
white
trousers
and
white
shoes
the
only
relief
was
a
big
black
cigar
which
he
confidentially
informed
the
company
was
not
from
his
usual
stack
bought
at
per
barrel
the
state
of
missouri
has
for
its
coat
of
arms
a
barrel
head
with
two
missourians
one
on
each
side
of
it
and
mark
the
motto

we
fall
mr
carnegie
this
evening
has
suffered
from
compliments
it
is
interesting
to
hear
what
people
will
say
about
a
man
why
at
the
banquet
given
by
this
club
in
my
honor
mr
carnegie
had
the
inspiration
for
which
the
club
is
now
honoring
him
if
dunfermline
contributed
so
much
to
the
united
states
in
contributing
mr
carnegie
what
would
have
happened
if
all
scotland
had
turned
out
these
dunfermline
folk
have
acquired
advantages
in
coming
to
america
doctor
mckelway
paid
the
top
compliment
the
cumulation
when
he
said
of
mr
carnegie
there
is
a
man
who
wants
to
pay
more
taxes
than
he
is
charged
richard
watson
gilder
did
very
well
for
a
poet
he
advertised
his
magazine
he
spoke
of
hiring
mr
carnegie
the
next
thing
he
will
be
trying
to
hire
me
if
i
undertook
to
pay
compliments
i
would
do
it
stronger
than
any
others
have
done
it
for
what
mr
carnegie
wants
are
strong
compliments
now
the
other
side
of
seventy
i
have
preserved
as
my
chiefest
virtue
modesty
on
poetry
veracity
and
suicide
address
at
a
dinner
of
the
manhattan
dickens
fellowship
new
york
city
february
this
dinner
was
in
commemoration
of
the
ninety
fourth
anniversary
of
the
birth
of
charles
dickens
on
an
other
occasion
mr
clemens
told
the
same
story
with
variations
and
a
different
conclusion
to
the
university
settlement
society
i
always
had
taken
an
interest
in
young
people
who
wanted
to
become
poets
i
remember
i
was
particularly
interested
in
one
budding
poet
when
i
was
a
reporter
his
name
was
butter
one
day
he
came
to
me
and
said
disconsolately
that
he
was
going
to
commit
suicide
he
was
tired
of
life
not
being
able
to
express
his
thoughts
in
poetic
form
butter
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
the
idea
i
said
i
would
that
it
was
a
good
idea
you
can
do
me
a
friendly
turn
you
go
off
in
a
private
place
and
do
it
there
and
i'll
get
it
all
you
do
it
and
i'll
do
as
much
for
you
some
time
at
first
he
determined
to
drown
himself
drowning
is
so
nice
and
clean
and
writes
up
so
well
in
a
newspaper
but
things
ne'er
do
go
smoothly
in
weddings
suicides
or
courtships
only
there
at
the
edge
of
the
water
where
butter
was
to
end
himself
lay
a
life
preserver
a
big
round
canvas
one
which
would
float
after
the
scrap
iron
was
soaked
out
of
it
butter
wouldn't
kill
himself
with
the
life
preserver
in
sight
and
so
i
had
an
idea
i
took
it
to
a
pawnshop
and
it
for
a
revolver
the
pawnbroker
didn't
think
much
of
the
exchange
but
when
i
explained
the
situation
he
acquiesced
we
went
up
on
top
of
a
high
building
and
this
is
what
happened
to
the
poet
he
put
the
revolver
to
his
forehead
and
blew
a
tunnel
straight
through
his
head
the
tunnel
was
about
the
size
of
your
finger
you
could
look
right
through
it
the
job
was
complete
there
was
nothing
in
it
well
after
that
that
man
never
could
write
prose
but
he
could
write
poetry
he
could
write
it
after
he
had
blown
his
brains
out
there
is
lots
of
that
talent
all
over
the
country
but
the
trouble
is
they
don't
develop
it
i
am
suffering
now
from
the
fact
that
i
who
have
told
the
truth
a
good
many
times
in
my
life
have
lately
received
more
letters
than
anybody
else
urging
me
to
lead
a
righteous
life
i
have
more
friends
who
want
to
see
me
develop
on
a
high
level
than
anybody
else
young
john
d
rockefeller
two
weeks
ago
taught
his
bible
class
all
about
veracity
and
why
it
was
better
that
everybody
should
always
keep
a
plentiful
supply
on
hand
some
of
the
letters
i
have
received
suggest
that
i
ought
to
attend
his
class
and
learn
too
why
i
know
mr
rockefeller
and
he
is
a
good
fellow
he
is
competent
in
many
ways
to
teach
a
bible
class
but
when
it
comes
to
veracity
he
is
only
thirty
five
years
old
i'm
seventy
years
old
i
have
been
familiar
with
veracity
twice
as
long
as
he
and
the
story
about
george
washington
and
his
little
hatchet
has
also
been
suggested
to
me
in
these
letters
in
a
fugitive
way
as
if
i
needed
some
of
george
washington
and
his
hatchet
in
my
constitution
why
dear
me
they
overlook
the
real
point
in
that
story
the
point
is
not
the
one
that
is
usually
suggested
and
you
can
readily
see
that
the
point
is
not
that
george
said
to
his
father
yes
father
i
cut
down
the
cheery
tree
i
can't
tell
a
lie
but
that
the
little
boy
only
seven
years
old
should
have
his
sagacity
developed
under
such
circumstances
he
was
a
boy
wise
beyond
his
years
his
conduct
then
was
a
prophecy
of
later
years
yes
i
think
he
was
the
most
remarkable
man
the
country
ever
produced
up
to
my
time
anyway
now
then
little
george
realized
that
circumstantial
evidence
was
against
him
he
knew
that
his
father
would
know
from
the
size
of
the
chips
that
no
full
grown
hatchet
cut
that
tree
down
and
that
no
man
would
have
haggled
it
so
he
knew
that
his
father
would
send
around
the
plantation
and
inquire
for
a
small
boy
with
a
hatchet
and
he
had
the
wisdom
to
come
out
and
confess
it
now
the
idea
that
his
father
was
overjoyed
when
he
told
little
george
that
he
would
rather
have
him
cut
down
a
thousand
cheery
trees
than
tell
a
lie
is
all
nonsense
what
did
he
really
mean
why
that
he
was
absolutely
astonished
that
he
had
a
son
who
had
the
chance
to
tell
a
lie
and
didn't
i
admire
old
george
if
that
was
his
name
for
his
discernment
he
knew
when
he
said
that
his
son
couldn't
tell
a
lie
that
he
was
stretching
it
a
good
deal
he
wouldn't
have
to
go
to
john
d
rockefeller's
bible
class
to
find
that
out
the
way
the
old
george
washington
story
goes
down
it
doesn't
do
anybody
any
good
it
only
discourages
people
who
can
tell
a
lie
welcome
home
address
at
the
dinner
in
his
honor
at
the
lotos
club
november
in
august
just
before
sailing
for
australia
mr
clemens
issued
the
following
statement
it
has
been
reported
that
i
sacrificed
for
the
benefit
of
the
creditors
the
property
of
the
publishing
firm
whose
financial
backer
i
was
and
that
i
am
now
lecturing
for
my
own
benefit
this
is
an
error
i
intend
the
lectures
as
well
as
the
property
for
the
creditors
the
law
recognizes
no
mortgage
on
a
man's
brains
and
a
merchant
who
has
given
up
all
he
has
may
take
advantage
of
the
laws
of
insolvency
and
may
start
free
again
for
himself
but
i
am
not
a
business
man
and
honor
is
a
harder
master
than
the
law
it
cannot
compromise
for
less
than
one
hundred
cents
on
a
dollar
and
its
debts
are
never
outlawed
i
had
a
two
thirds
interest
in
the
publishing
firm
whose
capital
i
furnished
if
the
firm
had
prospered
i
would
have
expected
to
collect
two
thirds
of
the
profits
as
it
is
i
expect
to
pay
all
the
debts
my
partner
has
no
resources
and
i
do
not
look
for
assistance
to
my
wife
whose
contributions
in
cash
from
her
own
means
have
nearly
equalled
the
claims
of
all
the
creditors
combined
she
has
taken
nothing
on
the
contrary
she
has
helped
and
intends
to
help
me
to
satisfy
the
obligations
due
to
the
rest
of
the
creditors
it
is
my
intention
to
ask
my
creditors
to
accept
that
as
a
legal
discharge
and
trust
to
my
honor
to
pay
the
other
fifty
per
cent
as
fast
as
i
can
earn
it
from
my
reception
thus
far
on
my
lecturing
tour
i
am
confident
that
if
i
live
i
can
pay
off
the
last
debt
within
four
years
after
which
at
the
age
of
sixty
four
i
can
make
a
fresh
and
unincumbered
start
in
life
i
am
going
to
australia
india
and
south
africa
and
next
year
i
hope
to
make
a
tour
of
the
great
cities
of
the
united
states
i
thank
you
all
out
of
my
heart
for
this
fraternal
welcome
and
it
seems
almost
too
fine
almost
too
magnificent
for
a
humble
missourian
such
as
i
am
far
from
his
native
haunts
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
yet
my
modesty
is
in
a
degree
fortified
by
observing
that
i
am
not
the
only
missourian
who
has
been
honored
here
to
night
for
i
see
at
this
very
table
here
is
a
missourian
mr
and
there
is
a
missourian
mr
and
there
is
another
missourian
and
hendrix
and
clemens
and
last
but
not
least
the
greatest
missourian
of
them
all
here
he
sits
tom
reed
who
has
always
concealed
his
birth
till
now
and
since
i
have
been
away
i
know
what
has
been
happening
in
his
case
he
has
deserted
politics
and
now
is
leading
a
creditable
life
he
has
reformed
and
god
prosper
him
and
i
judge
by
a
remark
which
he
made
up
stairs
awhile
ago
that
he
had
found
a
new
business
that
is
utterly
suited
to
his
make
and
constitution
and
all
he
is
doing
now
is
that
he
is
around
raising
the
average
of
personal
beauty
but
i
am
grateful
to
the
president
for
the
kind
words
which
he
has
said
of
me
and
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
whether
these
praises
were
deserved
or
not
i
prefer
to
accept
them
just
as
they
stand
without
concerning
myself
with
the
statistics
upon
which
they
have
been
built
but
only
with
that
large
matter
that
essential
matter
the
good
fellowship
the
kindliness
the
magnanimity
and
generosity
that
prompted
their
utterance
well
many
things
have
happened
since
i
sat
here
before
and
now
that
i
think
of
it
the
president's
reference
to
the
debts
which
were
left
by
the
bankrupt
firm
of
charles
l
webster
co
gives
me
an
opportunity
to
say
a
word
which
i
very
much
wish
to
say
not
for
myself
but
for
ninety
five
men
and
women
whom
i
shall
always
hold
in
high
esteem
and
in
pleasant
remembrance
the
creditors
of
that
firm
they
treated
me
well
they
treated
me
handsomely
there
were
ninety
six
of
them
and
by
not
a
finger's
weight
did
ninety
five
of
them
add
to
the
burden
of
that
time
for
me
ninety
five
out
of
the
ninety
six
they
didn't
indicate
by
any
word
or
sign
that
they
were
anxious
about
their
money
they
treated
me
well
and
i
shall
not
forget
it
i
could
not
forget
it
if
i
wanted
to
many
of
them
said
don't
you
worry
don't
you
hurry
that's
what
they
said
why
if
i
could
have
that
kind
of
creditors
always
and
that
experience
i
would
recognize
it
as
a
personal
loss
to
be
out
of
debt
i
owe
those
ninety
five
creditors
a
debt
of
homage
and
i
pay
it
now
in
such
measure
as
one
may
pay
so
fine
a
debt
in
mere
words
yes
they
said
that
very
thing
i
was
not
personally
acquainted
with
ten
of
them
and
yet
they
said
don't
you
worry
and
don't
you
hurry
i
know
that
phrase
by
heart
and
if
all
the
other
music
should
perish
out
of
the
world
it
would
still
sing
to
me
i
appreciate
that
i
am
glad
to
say
this
word
people
say
so
much
about
me
and
they
forget
those
creditors
they
were
handsomer
than
i
was
or
tom
reed
oh
you
have
been
doing
many
things
in
this
time
that
i
have
been
absent
you
have
done
lots
of
things
some
that
are
well
worth
remembering
too
now
we
have
fought
a
righteous
war
since
i
have
gone
and
that
is
rare
in
history
a
righteous
war
is
so
rare
that
it
is
almost
unknown
in
history
but
by
the
grace
of
that
war
we
set
cuba
free
and
we
joined
her
to
those
three
or
four
nations
that
exist
on
this
earth
and
we
started
out
to
set
those
poor
filipinos
free
too
and
why
why
why
that
most
righteous
purpose
of
ours
has
apparently
miscarried
i
suppose
i
never
shall
know
but
we
have
made
a
most
creditable
record
in
china
in
these
days
our
sound
and
level
headed
administration
has
made
a
most
creditable
record
over
there
and
there
are
some
of
the
powers
that
cannot
say
that
by
any
means
the
yellow
terror
is
threatening
this
world
to
day
it
is
looming
vast
and
ominous
on
that
distant
horizon
i
do
not
know
what
is
going
to
be
the
result
of
that
yellow
terror
but
our
government
has
had
no
hand
in
evoking
it
and
let's
be
happy
in
that
and
proud
of
it
we
have
nursed
free
silver
we
watched
by
its
cradle
we
have
done
the
best
we
could
to
raise
that
child
but
those
pestiferous
republicans
have
well
they
keep
giving
it
the
measles
every
chance
they
get
and
we
never
shall
raise
that
child
well
that's
no
matter
there's
plenty
of
other
things
to
do
and
we
must
think
of
something
else
well
we
have
tried
a
president
four
years
criticised
him
and
found
fault
with
him
the
whole
time
and
turned
around
a
day
or
two
ago
with
votes
enough
to
spare
to
elect
another
o
consistency
consistency
thy
name
i
don't
know
what
thy
name
is
thompson
will
do
any
name
will
do
but
you
see
there
is
the
fact
there
is
the
consistency
then
we
have
tried
for
governor
an
illustrious
rough
rider
and
we
liked
him
so
much
in
that
great
office
that
now
we
have
made
him
vice
president
not
in
order
that
that
office
shall
give
him
distinction
but
that
he
may
confer
distinction
upon
that
office
and
it's
needed
too
it's
needed
and
now
for
a
while
anyway
we
shall
not
be
stammering
and
embarrassed
when
a
stranger
asks
us
what
is
the
name
of
the
vice
president
this
one
is
known
this
one
is
pretty
well
known
pretty
widely
known
and
in
some
quarters
favorably
i
am
not
accustomed
to
dealing
in
these
fulsome
compliments
and
i
am
probably
overdoing
it
a
little
but
well
my
old
affectionate
admiration
for
governor
roosevelt
has
probably
betrayed
me
into
the
complimentary
excess
but
i
know
him
and
you
know
him
and
if
you
give
him
rope
enough
i
mean
if
oh
yes
he
will
justify
that
compliment
leave
it
just
as
it
is
and
now
we
have
put
in
his
place
mr
odell
another
rough
rider
i
suppose
all
the
fat
things
go
to
that
profession
now
why
i
could
have
been
a
rough
rider
myself
if
i
had
known
that
this
political
klondike
was
going
to
open
up
and
i
would
have
been
a
rough
rider
if
i
could
have
gone
to
war
on
an
automobile
but
not
on
a
horse
no
i
know
the
horse
too
well
i
have
known
the
horse
in
war
and
in
peace
and
there
is
no
place
where
a
horse
is
comfortable
the
horse
has
too
many
caprices
and
he
is
too
much
given
to
initiative
he
invents
too
many
new
ideas
no
i
don't
want
anything
to
do
with
a
horse
and
then
we
have
taken
chauncey
depew
out
of
a
useful
and
active
life
and
made
him
a
senator
embalmed
him
corked
him
up
and
i
am
not
grieving
that
man
has
said
many
a
true
thing
about
me
in
his
time
and
i
always
said
something
would
happen
to
him
look
at
that
to
mr
gilded
mummy
he
has
made
my
life
a
sorrow
to
me
at
many
a
banquet
on
both
sides
of
the
ocean
and
now
he
has
got
it
perish
the
hand
that
pulls
that
cork
all
these
things
have
happened
all
these
things
have
come
to
pass
while
i
have
been
away
and
it
just
shows
how
little
a
mugwump
can
be
missed
in
a
cold
unfeeling
world
even
when
he
is
the
last
one
that
is
left
a
grand
old
party
all
by
himself
and
there
is
another
thing
that
has
happened
perhaps
the
most
imposing
event
of
them
all
the
institution
called
the
daughters
of
the
crown
the
daughters
of
the
royal
crown
has
established
itself
and
gone
into
business
now
there's
an
american
idea
for
you
there's
an
idea
born
of
god
knows
what
kind
of
specialized
insanity
but
not
softening
of
the
brain
you
cannot
soften
a
thing
that
doesn't
exist
the
daughters
of
the
royal
crown
nobody
eligible
but
american
descendants
of
charles
ii
dear
me
how
the
fancy
product
of
that
old
harem
still
holds
out
well
i
am
truly
glad
to
foregather
with
you
again
and
partake
of
the
bread
and
salt
of
this
hospitable
house
once
more
seven
years
ago
when
i
was
your
guest
here
when
i
was
old
and
despondent
you
gave
me
the
grip
and
the
word
that
lift
a
man
up
and
make
him
glad
to
be
alive
and
now
i
come
back
from
my
exile
young
again
fresh
and
alive
and
ready
to
begin
life
once
more
and
your
welcome
puts
the
finishing
touch
upon
my
restored
youth
and
makes
it
real
to
me
and
not
a
gracious
dream
that
must
vanish
with
the
morning
i
thank
you
an
undelivered
speech
the
steamship
st
paul
was
to
have
been
launched
from
cramp's
shipyard
in
philadelphia
on
march
after
the
launching
a
luncheon
was
to
have
been
given
at
which
mr
clemens
was
to
make
a
speech
just
before
the
final
word
was
given
a
reporter
asked
mr
clemens
for
a
copy
of
his
speech
to
be
delivered
at
the
luncheon
to
facilitate
the
work
of
the
reporter
he
loaned
him
a
typewritten
copy
of
the
speech
it
happened
however
that
when
the
blocks
were
knocked
away
the
big
ship
refused
to
budge
and
no
amount
of
labor
could
move
her
an
inch
she
had
stuck
fast
upon
the
ways
as
a
result
the
launching
was
postponed
for
a
week
or
two
but
in
the
mean
time
mr
clemens
had
gone
to
europe
years
after
a
reporter
called
on
mr
clemens
and
submitted
the
manuscript
of
the
speech
which
was
as
follows
day
after
to
morrow
i
sail
for
england
in
a
ship
of
this
line
the
paris
it
will
be
my
fourteenth
crossing
in
three
years
and
a
half
therefore
my
presence
here
as
you
see
is
quite
natural
quite
commercial
i
am
interested
in
ships
they
interest
me
more
now
than
hotels
do
when
a
new
ship
is
launched
i
feel
a
desire
to
go
and
see
if
she
will
be
good
quarters
for
me
to
live
in
particularly
if
she
belongs
to
this
line
for
it
is
by
this
line
that
i
have
done
most
of
my
ferrying
people
wonder
why
i
go
so
much
well
i
go
partly
for
my
health
partly
to
familiarize
myself
with
the
road
i
have
gone
over
the
same
road
so
many
times
now
that
i
know
all
the
whales
that
belong
along
the
route
and
latterly
it
is
an
embarrassment
to
me
to
meet
them
for
they
do
not
look
glad
to
see
me
but
annoyed
and
they
seem
to
say
here
is
this
old
derelict
again
earlier
in
life
this
would
have
pained
me
and
made
me
ashamed
but
i
am
older
now
and
when
i
am
behaving
myself
and
doing
right
i
do
not
care
for
a
whale's
opinion
about
me
when
we
are
young
we
generally
estimate
an
opinion
by
the
size
of
the
person
that
holds
it
but
later
we
find
that
that
is
an
uncertain
rule
for
we
realize
that
there
are
times
when
a
hornet's
opinion
disturbs
us
more
than
an
emperor's
i
do
not
mean
that
i
care
nothing
at
all
for
a
whale's
opinion
for
that
would
be
going
to
too
great
a
length
of
course
it
is
better
to
have
the
good
opinion
of
a
whale
than
his
disapproval
but
my
position
is
that
if
you
cannot
have
a
whale's
good
opinion
except
at
some
sacrifice
of
principle
or
personal
dignity
it
is
better
to
try
to
live
without
it
that
is
my
idea
about
whales
yes
i
have
gone
over
that
same
route
so
often
that
i
know
my
way
without
a
compass
just
by
the
waves
i
know
all
the
large
waves
and
a
good
many
of
the
small
ones
also
the
sunsets
i
know
every
sunset
and
where
it
belongs
just
by
its
color
necessarily
then
i
do
not
make
the
passage
now
for
scenery
that
is
all
gone
by
what
i
prize
most
is
safety
and
in
the
second
place
swift
transit
and
handiness
these
are
best
furnished
by
the
american
line
whose
watertight
compartments
have
no
passage
through
them
no
doors
to
be
left
open
and
consequently
no
way
for
water
to
get
from
one
of
them
to
another
in
time
of
collision
if
you
nullify
the
peril
which
collisions
threaten
you
with
you
nullify
the
only
very
serious
peril
which
attends
voyages
in
the
great
liners
of
our
day
and
makes
voyaging
safer
than
staying
at
home
when
the
paris
was
half
torn
to
pieces
some
years
ago
enough
of
the
atlantic
ebbed
and
flowed
through
one
end
of
her
during
her
long
agony
to
sink
the
fleets
of
the
world
if
distributed
among
them
but
she
floated
in
perfect
safety
and
no
life
was
lost
in
time
of
collision
the
rock
of
gibraltar
is
not
safer
than
the
paris
and
other
great
ships
of
this
line
this
seems
to
be
the
only
great
line
in
the
world
that
takes
a
passenger
from
metropolis
to
metropolis
without
the
intervention
of
tugs
and
barges
or
bridges
takes
him
through
without
breaking
bulk
so
to
speak
on
the
english
side
he
lands
at
a
dock
on
the
dock
a
special
train
is
waiting
in
an
hour
and
three
quarters
he
is
in
london
nothing
could
be
handier
if
your
journey
were
from
a
sand
pit
on
our
side
to
a
lighthouse
on
the
other
you
could
make
it
quicker
by
other
lines
but
that
is
not
the
case
the
journey
is
from
the
city
of
new
york
to
the
city
of
london
and
no
line
can
do
that
journey
quicker
than
this
one
nor
anywhere
near
as
conveniently
and
handily
and
when
the
passenger
lands
on
our
side
he
lands
on
the
american
side
of
the
river
not
in
the
provinces
as
a
very
learned
man
said
on
the
last
voyage
he
is
head
quartermaster
of
the
new
york
land
garboard
streak
of
the
middle
watch
when
we
land
a
passenger
on
the
american
side
there's
nothing
betwix
him
and
his
hotel
but
hell
and
the
hackman
i
am
glad
with
you
and
the
nation
to
welcome
the
new
ship
she
is
another
pride
another
consolation
for
a
great
country
whose
mighty
fleets
have
all
vanished
and
which
has
almost
forgotten
what
it
is
to
fly
its
flag
to
sea
i
am
not
sure
as
to
which
st
paul
she
is
named
for
some
think
it
is
the
one
that
is
on
the
upper
mississippi
but
the
head
quartermaster
told
me
it
was
the
one
that
killed
goliath
but
it
is
not
important
no
matter
which
it
is
let
us
give
her
hearty
welcome
and
godspeed
sixty
seventh
birthday
at
the
metropolitan
club
new
york
november
address
at
a
dinner
given
in
honor
of
mr
clemens
by
colonel
harvey
president
of
harper
amp
brothers
i
think
i
ought
to
be
allowed
to
talk
as
long
as
i
want
to
for
the
reason
that
i
have
cancelled
all
my
winter's
engagements
of
every
kind
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
and
am
making
no
new
engagements
for
this
winter
and
therefore
this
is
the
only
chance
i
shall
have
to
disembowel
my
skull
for
a
year
close
the
mouth
in
that
portrait
for
a
year
i
want
to
offer
thanks
and
homage
to
the
chairman
for
this
innovation
which
he
has
introduced
here
which
is
an
improvement
as
i
consider
it
on
the
old
fashioned
style
of
conducting
occasions
like
this
that
was
bad
that
was
a
bad
bad
bad
arrangement
under
that
old
custom
the
chairman
got
up
and
made
a
speech
he
introduced
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
and
covered
him
all
over
with
compliments
nothing
but
compliments
not
a
thing
but
compliments
never
a
slur
and
sat
down
and
left
that
man
to
get
up
and
talk
without
a
text
you
cannot
talk
on
compliments
that
is
not
a
text
no
modest
person
and
i
was
born
one
can
talk
on
compliments
a
man
gets
up
and
is
filled
to
the
eyes
with
happy
emotions
but
his
tongue
is
tied
he
has
nothing
to
say
he
is
in
the
condition
of
doctor
rice's
friend
who
came
home
drunk
and
explained
it
to
his
wife
and
his
wife
said
to
him
john
when
you
have
drunk
all
the
whiskey
you
want
you
ought
to
ask
for
sarsaparilla
he
said
yes
but
when
i
have
drunk
all
the
whiskey
i
want
i
can't
say
sarsaparilla
and
so
i
think
it
is
much
better
to
leave
a
man
unmolested
until
the
testimony
and
pleadings
are
all
in
otherwise
he
is
dumb
he
is
at
the
sarsaparilla
stage
before
i
get
to
the
higgledy
piggledy
point
as
mr
howells
suggested
i
do
i
want
to
thank
you
gentlemen
for
this
very
high
honor
you
are
doing
me
and
i
am
quite
competent
to
estimate
it
at
its
value
i
see
around
me
captains
of
all
the
illustrious
industries
most
distinguished
men
there
are
more
than
fifty
here
and
i
believe
i
know
thirty
nine
of
them
well
i
could
probably
borrow
money
from
from
the
others
anyway
it
is
a
proud
thing
to
me
indeed
to
see
such
a
distinguished
company
gather
here
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
when
there
is
no
foreign
prince
to
be
feted
when
you
have
come
here
not
to
do
honor
to
hereditary
privilege
and
ancient
lineage
but
to
do
reverence
to
mere
moral
excellence
and
elemental
veracity
and
dear
me
how
old
it
seems
to
make
me
i
look
around
me
and
i
see
three
or
four
persons
i
have
known
so
many
many
years
i
have
known
mr
secretary
hay
john
hay
as
the
nation
and
the
rest
of
his
friends
love
to
call
him
i
have
known
john
hay
and
tom
reed
and
the
reverend
twichell
close
upon
thirty
six
years
close
upon
thirty
six
years
i
have
known
those
venerable
men
i
have
known
mr
howells
nearly
thirty
four
years
and
i
knew
chauncey
depew
before
he
could
walk
straight
and
before
he
learned
to
tell
the
truth
twenty
seven
years
ago
i
heard
him
make
the
most
noble
and
eloquent
and
beautiful
speech
that
has
ever
fallen
from
even
his
capable
lips
tom
reed
said
that
my
principal
defect
was
inaccuracy
of
statement
well
suppose
that
that
is
true
what's
the
use
of
telling
the
truth
all
the
time
i
never
tell
the
truth
about
tom
reed
but
that
is
his
defect
truth
he
speaks
the
truth
always
tom
reed
has
a
good
heart
and
he
has
a
good
intellect
but
he
hasn't
any
judgment
why
when
tom
reed
was
invited
to
lecture
to
the
ladies
society
for
the
procreation
or
procrastination
or
something
of
morals
i
don't
know
what
it
was
advancement
i
suppose
of
pure
morals
he
had
the
immortal
indiscretion
to
begin
by
saying
that
some
of
us
can't
be
optimists
but
by
judiciously
utilizing
the
opportunities
that
providence
puts
in
our
way
we
can
all
be
bigamists
you
perceive
his
limitations
anything
he
has
in
his
mind
he
states
if
he
thinks
it
is
true
well
that
was
true
but
that
was
no
place
to
say
it
so
they
fired
him
out
a
lot
of
accounts
have
been
settled
here
tonight
for
me
i
have
held
grudges
against
some
of
these
people
but
they
have
all
been
wiped
out
by
the
very
handsome
compliments
that
have
been
paid
me
even
wayne
macveagh
i
have
had
a
grudge
against
him
many
years
the
first
time
i
saw
wayne
macveagh
was
at
a
private
dinner
party
at
charles
a
dana's
and
when
i
got
there
he
was
clattering
along
and
i
tried
to
get
a
word
in
here
and
there
but
you
know
what
wayne
macveagh
is
when
he
is
started
and
i
could
not
get
in
five
words
to
his
one
or
one
word
to
his
five
i
struggled
along
and
struggled
along
and
well
i
wanted
to
tell
and
i
was
trying
to
tell
a
dream
i
had
had
the
night
before
and
it
was
a
remarkable
dream
a
dream
worth
people's
while
to
listen
to
a
dream
recounting
sam
jones
the
revivalist's
reception
in
heaven
i
was
on
a
train
and
was
approaching
the
celestial
way
station
i
had
a
through
ticket
and
i
noticed
a
man
sitting
alongside
of
me
asleep
and
he
had
his
ticket
in
his
hat
he
was
the
remains
of
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
i
recognized
him
by
his
photograph
i
had
nothing
against
him
so
i
took
his
ticket
and
let
him
have
mine
he
didn't
object
he
wasn't
in
a
condition
to
object
and
presently
when
the
train
stopped
at
the
heavenly
station
well
i
got
off
and
he
went
on
by
request
but
there
they
all
were
the
angels
you
know
millions
of
them
every
one
with
a
torch
they
had
arranged
for
a
torch
light
procession
they
were
expecting
the
archbishop
and
when
i
got
off
they
started
to
raise
a
shout
but
it
didn't
materialize
i
don't
know
whether
they
were
disappointed
i
suppose
they
had
a
lot
of
superstitious
ideas
about
the
archbishop
and
what
he
should
look
like
and
i
didn't
fill
the
bill
and
i
was
trying
to
explain
to
saint
peter
and
was
doing
it
in
the
german
tongue
because
i
didn't
want
to
be
too
explicit
well
i
found
it
was
no
use
i
couldn't
get
along
for
wayne
macveagh
was
occupying
the
whole
place
and
i
said
to
mr
dana
what
is
the
matter
with
that
man
who
is
that
man
with
the
long
tongue
what's
the
trouble
with
him
that
long
lank
cadaver
old
oil
derrick
out
of
a
job
who
is
that
well
now
mr
dana
said
you
don't
want
to
meddle
with
him
you
had
better
keep
quiet
just
keep
quiet
because
that's
a
bad
man
talk
he
was
born
to
talk
don't
let
him
get
out
with
you
he'll
skin
you
i
said
i
have
been
skinned
skinned
and
skinned
for
years
there
is
nothing
left
he
said
oh
you'll
find
there
is
that
man
is
the
very
seed
and
inspiration
of
that
proverb
which
says
no
matter
how
close
you
skin
an
onion
a
clever
man
can
always
peel
it
again
well
i
reflected
and
i
quieted
down
that
would
never
occur
to
tom
reed
he's
got
no
discretion
well
macveagh
is
just
the
same
man
he
hasn't
changed
a
bit
in
all
those
years
he
has
been
peeling
mr
mitchell
lately
that's
the
kind
of
man
he
is
mr
howells
that
poem
of
his
is
admirable
that's
the
way
to
treat
a
person
howells
has
a
peculiar
gift
for
seeing
the
merits
of
people
and
he
has
always
exhibited
them
in
my
favor
howells
has
never
written
anything
about
me
that
i
couldn't
read
six
or
seven
times
a
day
he
is
always
just
and
always
fair
he
has
written
more
appreciatively
of
me
than
any
one
in
this
world
and
published
it
in
the
north
american
review
he
did
me
the
justice
to
say
that
my
intentions
he
italicized
that
that
my
intentions
were
always
good
that
i
wounded
people's
conventions
rather
than
their
convictions
now
i
wouldn't
want
anything
handsomer
than
that
said
of
me
i
would
rather
wait
with
anything
harsh
i
might
have
to
say
till
the
convictions
become
conventions
bangs
has
traced
me
all
the
way
down
he
can't
find
that
honest
man
but
i
will
look
for
him
in
the
looking
glass
when
i
get
home
it
was
intimated
by
the
colonel
that
it
is
new
england
that
makes
new
york
and
builds
up
this
country
and
makes
it
great
overlooking
the
fact
that
there's
a
lot
of
people
here
who
came
from
elsewhere
like
john
hay
from
away
out
west
and
howells
from
ohio
and
st
clair
mckelway
and
me
from
missouri
and
we
are
doing
what
we
can
to
build
up
new
york
a
little
elevate
it
why
when
i
was
living
in
that
village
of
hannibal
missouri
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
and
hay
up
in
the
town
of
warsaw
also
on
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
river
it
is
an
emotional
bit
of
the
mississippi
and
when
it
is
low
water
you
have
to
climb
up
to
it
on
a
ladder
and
when
it
floods
you
have
to
hunt
for
it
with
a
deep
sea
lead
but
it
is
a
great
and
beautiful
country
in
that
old
time
it
was
a
paradise
for
simplicity
it
was
a
simple
simple
life
cheap
but
comfortable
and
full
of
sweetness
and
there
was
nothing
of
this
rage
of
modern
civilization
there
at
all
it
was
a
delectable
land
i
went
out
there
last
june
and
i
met
in
that
town
of
hannibal
a
schoolmate
of
mine
john
briggs
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
more
than
fifty
years
i
tell
you
that
was
a
meeting
that
pal
whom
i
had
known
as
a
little
boy
long
ago
and
knew
now
as
a
stately
man
three
or
four
inches
over
six
feet
and
browned
by
exposure
to
many
climes
he
was
back
there
to
see
that
old
place
again
we
spent
a
whole
afternoon
going
about
here
and
there
and
yonder
and
hunting
up
the
scenes
and
talking
of
the
crimes
which
we
had
committed
so
long
ago
it
was
a
heartbreaking
delight
full
of
pathos
laughter
and
tears
all
mixed
together
and
we
called
the
roll
of
the
boys
and
girls
that
we
picnicked
and
sweethearted
with
so
many
years
ago
and
there
were
hardly
half
a
dozen
of
them
left
the
rest
were
in
their
graves
and
we
went
up
there
on
the
summit
of
that
hill
a
treasured
place
in
my
memory
the
summit
of
holiday's
hill
and
looked
out
again
over
that
magnificent
panorama
of
the
mississippi
river
sweeping
along
league
after
league
a
level
green
paradise
on
one
side
and
retreating
capes
and
promontories
as
far
as
you
could
see
on
the
other
fading
away
in
the
soft
rich
lights
of
the
remote
distance
i
recognized
then
that
i
was
seeing
now
the
most
enchanting
river
view
the
planet
could
furnish
i
never
knew
it
when
i
was
a
boy
it
took
an
educated
eye
that
had
travelled
over
the
globe
to
know
and
appreciate
it
and
john
said
can
you
point
out
the
place
where
bear
creek
used
to
be
before
the
railroad
came
i
said
yes
it
ran
along
yonder
and
can
you
point
out
the
swimming
hole
yes
out
there
and
he
said
can
you
point
out
the
place
where
we
stole
the
skiff
well
i
didn't
know
which
one
he
meant
such
a
wilderness
of
events
had
intervened
since
that
day
more
than
fifty
years
ago
it
took
me
more
than
five
minutes
to
call
back
that
little
incident
and
then
i
did
call
it
back
it
was
a
white
skiff
and
we
painted
it
red
to
allay
suspicion
and
the
saddest
saddest
man
came
along
a
stranger
he
was
and
he
looked
that
red
skiff
over
so
pathetically
and
he
said
well
if
it
weren't
for
the
complexion
i'd
know
whose
skiff
that
was
he
said
it
in
that
pleading
way
you
know
that
appeals
for
sympathy
and
suggestion
we
were
full
of
sympathy
for
him
but
we
weren't
in
any
condition
to
offer
suggestions
i
can
see
him
yet
as
he
turned
away
with
that
same
sad
look
on
his
face
and
vanished
out
of
history
forever
i
wonder
what
became
of
that
man
i
know
what
became
of
the
skiff
well
it
was
a
beautiful
life
a
lovely
life
there
was
no
crime
merely
little
things
like
pillaging
orchards
and
watermelon
patches
and
breaking
the
sabbath
we
didn't
break
the
sabbath
often
enough
to
signify
once
a
week
perhaps
but
we
were
good
boys
good
presbyterian
boys
all
presbyterian
boys
and
loyal
and
all
that
anyway
we
were
good
presbyterian
boys
when
the
weather
was
doubtful
when
it
was
fair
we
did
wander
a
little
from
the
fold
look
at
john
hay
and
me
there
we
were
in
obscurity
and
look
where
we
are
now
consider
the
ladder
which
he
has
climbed
the
illustrious
vocations
he
has
served
and
vocations
is
the
right
word
he
has
in
all
those
vocations
acquitted
himself
with
high
credit
and
honor
to
his
country
and
to
the
mother
that
bore
him
scholar
soldier
diplomat
poet
historian
now
see
where
we
are
he
is
secretary
of
state
and
i
am
a
gentleman
it
could
not
happen
in
any
other
country
our
institutions
give
men
the
positions
that
of
right
belong
to
them
through
merit
all
you
men
have
won
your
places
not
by
heredities
and
not
by
family
influence
or
extraneous
help
but
only
by
the
natural
gifts
god
gave
you
at
your
birth
made
effective
by
your
own
energies
this
is
the
country
to
live
in
now
there
is
one
invisible
guest
here
a
part
of
me
is
present
the
larger
part
the
better
part
is
yonder
at
her
home
that
is
my
wife
and
she
has
a
good
many
personal
friends
here
and
i
think
it
won't
distress
any
one
of
them
to
know
that
although
she
is
going
to
be
confined
to
that
bed
for
many
months
to
come
from
that
nervous
prostration
there
is
not
any
danger
and
she
is
coming
along
very
well
and
i
think
it
quite
appropriate
that
i
should
speak
of
her
i
knew
her
for
the
first
time
just
in
the
same
year
that
i
first
knew
john
hay
and
tom
reed
and
mr
twichell
thirty
six
years
ago
and
she
has
been
the
best
friend
i
have
ever
had
and
that
is
saying
a
good
deal
she
has
reared
me
she
and
twichell
together
and
what
i
am
i
owe
to
them
twichell
why
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
look
upon
twichell's
face
for
five
and
twenty
years
i
was
under
the
rev
mr
twichell's
tuition
i
was
in
his
pastorate
occupying
a
pew
in
his
church
and
held
him
in
due
reverence
that
man
is
full
of
all
the
graces
that
go
to
make
a
person
companionable
and
beloved
and
wherever
twichell
goes
to
start
a
church
the
people
flock
there
to
buy
the
land
they
find
real
estate
goes
up
all
around
the
spot
and
the
envious
and
the
thoughtful
always
try
to
get
twichell
to
move
to
their
neighborhood
and
start
a
church
and
wherever
you
see
him
go
you
can
go
and
buy
land
there
with
confidence
feeling
sure
that
there
will
be
a
double
price
for
you
before
very
long
i
am
not
saying
this
to
flatter
mr
twichell
it
is
the
fact
many
and
many
a
time
i
have
attended
the
annual
sale
in
his
church
and
bought
up
all
the
pews
on
a
margin
and
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
spiritually
and
financially
if
i
had
stayed
under
his
wing
i
have
tried
to
do
good
in
this
world
and
it
is
marvellous
in
how
many
different
ways
i
have
done
good
and
it
is
comfortable
to
reflect
now
there's
mr
rogers
just
out
of
the
affection
i
bear
that
man
many
a
time
i
have
given
him
points
in
finance
that
he
had
never
thought
of
and
if
he
could
lay
aside
envy
prejudice
and
superstition
and
utilize
those
ideas
in
his
business
it
would
make
a
difference
in
his
bank
account
well
i
like
the
poetry
i
like
all
the
speeches
and
the
poetry
too
i
liked
doctor
van
dyke's
poem
i
wish
i
could
return
thanks
in
proper
measure
to
you
gentlemen
who
have
spoken
and
violated
your
feelings
to
pay
me
compliments
some
were
merited
and
some
you
overlooked
it
is
true
and
colonel
harvey
did
slander
every
one
of
you
and
put
things
into
my
mouth
that
i
never
said
never
thought
of
at
all
and
now
my
wife
and
i
out
of
our
single
heart
return
you
our
deepest
and
most
grateful
thanks
and
yesterday
was
her
birthday
to
the
whitefriars
address
at
the
dinner
given
by
the
whitefriars
club
in
honor
of
mr
clemens
london
june
the
whitefriars
club
was
founded
by
dr
samuel
johnson
and
mr
clemens
was
made
an
honorary
member
in
the
members
are
representative
of
literary
and
journalistic
london
the
toast
of
our
guest
was
proposed
by
louis
f
austin
of
the
illustrated
london
news
and
in
the
course
of
some
humorous
remarks
he
referred
to
the
vow
and
to
the
imaginary
woes
of
the
friars
as
the
members
of
the
club
style
themselves
mr
chairman
and
brethren
of
the
vow
in
whatever
the
vow
is
for
although
i
have
been
a
member
of
this
club
for
five
and
twenty
years
i
don't
know
any
more
about
what
that
vow
is
than
mr
austin
seems
to
but
what
ever
the
vow
is
i
don't
care
what
it
is
i
have
made
a
thousand
vows
there
is
no
pleasure
comparable
to
making
a
vow
in
the
presence
of
one
who
appreciates
that
vow
in
the
presence
of
men
who
honor
and
appreciate
you
for
making
the
vow
and
men
who
admire
you
for
making
the
vow
there
is
only
one
pleasure
higher
than
that
and
that
is
to
get
outside
and
break
the
vow
a
vow
is
always
a
pledge
of
some
kind
or
other
for
the
protection
of
your
own
morals
and
principles
or
somebody
else's
and
generally
by
the
irony
of
fate
it
is
for
the
protection
of
your
own
morals
hence
we
have
pledges
that
make
us
eschew
tobacco
or
wine
and
while
you
are
taking
the
pledge
there
is
a
holy
influence
about
that
makes
you
feel
you
are
reformed
and
that
you
can
never
be
so
happy
again
in
this
world
until
you
get
outside
and
take
a
drink
i
had
forgotten
that
i
was
a
member
of
this
club
it
is
so
long
ago
but
now
i
remember
that
i
was
here
five
and
twenty
years
ago
and
that
i
was
then
at
a
dinner
of
the
whitefriars
club
and
it
was
in
those
old
days
when
you
had
just
made
two
great
finds
all
london
was
talking
about
nothing
else
than
that
they
had
found
livingstone
and
that
the
lost
sir
roger
tichborne
had
been
found
and
they
were
trying
him
for
it
and
at
the
dinner
chairman
i
do
not
know
who
he
was
failed
to
come
to
time
the
gentleman
who
had
been
appointed
to
pay
me
the
customary
compliments
and
to
introduce
me
forgot
the
compliments
and
did
not
know
what
they
were
and
george
augustus
sala
came
in
at
the
last
moment
just
when
i
was
about
to
go
without
compliments
altogether
and
that
man
was
a
gifted
man
they
just
called
on
him
instantaneously
while
he
was
going
to
sit
down
to
introduce
the
stranger
and
sala
made
one
of
those
marvellous
speeches
which
he
was
capable
of
making
i
think
no
man
talked
so
fast
as
sala
did
one
did
not
need
wine
while
he
was
making
a
speech
the
rapidity
of
his
utterance
made
a
man
drunk
in
a
minute
an
incomparable
speech
was
that
an
impromptu
speech
and
an
impromptu
speech
is
a
seldom
thing
and
he
did
it
so
well
he
went
into
the
whole
history
of
the
united
states
and
made
it
entirely
new
to
me
he
filled
it
with
episodes
and
incidents
that
washington
never
heard
of
and
he
did
it
so
convincingly
that
although
i
knew
none
of
it
had
happened
from
that
day
to
this
i
do
not
know
any
history
but
sala's
i
do
not
know
anything
so
sad
as
a
dinner
where
you
are
going
to
get
up
and
say
something
by
and
by
and
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
you
sit
and
wonder
and
wonder
what
the
gentleman
is
going
to
say
who
is
going
to
introduce
you
you
know
that
if
he
says
something
severe
that
if
he
will
deride
you
or
traduce
you
or
do
anything
of
that
kind
he
will
furnish
you
with
a
text
because
anybody
can
get
up
and
talk
against
that
anybody
can
get
up
and
straighten
out
his
character
but
when
a
gentleman
gets
up
and
merely
tells
the
truth
about
you
what
can
you
do
mr
austin
has
done
well
he
has
supplied
so
many
texts
that
i
will
have
to
drop
out
a
lot
of
them
and
that
is
about
as
difficult
as
when
you
do
not
have
any
text
at
all
now
he
made
a
beautiful
and
smooth
speech
without
any
difficulty
at
all
and
i
could
have
done
that
if
i
had
gone
on
with
the
schooling
with
which
i
began
i
see
here
a
gentleman
on
my
left
who
was
my
master
in
the
art
of
oratory
more
than
twenty
five
years
ago
when
i
look
upon
the
inspiring
face
of
mr
depew
it
carries
me
a
long
way
back
an
old
and
valued
friend
of
mine
is
he
and
i
saw
his
career
as
it
came
along
and
it
has
reached
pretty
well
up
to
now
when
he
by
another
miscarriage
of
justice
is
a
united
states
senator
but
those
were
delightful
days
when
i
was
taking
lessons
in
oratory
my
other
master
the
ambassador
is
not
here
yet
under
those
two
gentlemen
i
learned
to
make
after
dinner
speeches
and
it
was
charming
you
know
the
new
england
dinner
is
the
great
occasion
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
it
is
held
every
year
to
celebrate
the
landing
of
the
pilgrims
those
pilgrims
were
a
lot
of
people
who
were
not
needed
in
england
and
you
know
they
had
great
rivalry
and
they
were
persuaded
to
go
elsewhere
and
they
chartered
a
ship
called
mayflower
and
set
sail
and
i
have
heard
it
said
that
they
pumped
the
atlantic
ocean
through
that
ship
sixteen
times
they
fell
in
over
there
with
the
dutch
from
rotterdam
amsterdam
and
a
lot
of
other
places
with
profane
names
and
it
is
from
that
gang
that
mr
depew
is
descended
on
the
other
hand
mr
choate
is
descended
from
those
puritans
who
landed
on
a
bitter
night
in
december
every
year
those
people
used
to
meet
at
a
great
banquet
in
new
york
and
those
masters
of
mind
in
oratory
had
to
make
speeches
it
was
doctor
depew's
business
to
get
up
there
and
apologise
for
the
dutch
and
mr
choate
had
to
get
up
later
and
explain
the
crimes
of
the
puritans
and
grand
beautiful
times
we
used
to
have
it
is
curious
that
after
that
long
lapse
of
time
i
meet
the
whitefriars
again
some
looking
as
young
and
fresh
as
in
the
old
days
others
showing
a
certain
amount
of
wear
and
tear
and
here
after
all
this
time
i
find
one
of
the
masters
of
oratory
and
the
others
named
in
the
list
and
here
we
three
meet
again
as
exiles
on
one
pretext
or
another
and
you
will
notice
that
while
we
are
absent
there
is
a
pleasing
tranquillity
in
america
a
building
up
of
public
confidence
we
are
doing
the
best
we
can
for
our
country
i
think
we
have
spent
our
lives
in
serving
our
country
and
we
never
serve
it
to
greater
advantage
than
when
we
get
out
of
it
but
impromptu
speaking
that
is
what
i
was
trying
to
learn
that
is
a
difficult
thing
i
used
to
do
it
in
this
way
i
used
to
begin
about
a
week
ahead
and
write
out
my
impromptu
speech
and
get
it
by
heart
then
i
brought
it
to
the
new
england
dinner
printed
on
a
piece
of
paper
in
my
pocket
so
that
i
could
pass
it
to
the
reporters
all
cut
and
dried
and
in
order
to
do
an
impromptu
speech
as
it
should
be
done
you
have
to
indicate
the
places
for
pauses
and
hesitations
i
put
them
all
in
it
and
then
you
want
the
applause
in
the
right
places
when
i
got
to
the
place
where
it
should
come
in
if
it
did
not
come
in
i
did
not
care
but
i
had
it
marked
in
the
paper
and
these
masters
of
mind
used
to
wonder
why
it
was
my
speech
came
out
in
the
morning
in
the
first
person
while
theirs
went
through
the
butchery
of
synopsis
i
do
that
kind
of
speech
i
mean
an
offhand
speech
and
do
it
well
and
make
no
mistake
in
such
a
way
to
deceive
the
audience
completely
and
make
that
audience
believe
it
is
an
impromptu
speech
that
is
art
i
was
frightened
out
of
it
at
last
by
an
experience
of
doctor
hayes
he
was
a
sort
of
nansen
of
that
day
he
had
been
to
the
north
pole
and
it
made
him
celebrated
he
had
even
seen
the
polar
bear
climb
the
pole
he
had
made
one
of
those
magnificent
voyages
such
as
nansen
made
and
in
those
days
when
a
man
did
anything
which
greatly
distinguished
him
for
the
moment
he
had
to
come
on
to
the
lecture
platform
and
tell
all
about
it
doctor
hayes
was
a
great
magnificent
creature
like
nansen
superbly
built
he
was
to
appear
in
boston
he
wrote
his
lecture
out
and
it
was
his
purpose
to
read
it
from
manuscript
but
in
an
evil
hour
he
concluded
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
preface
it
with
something
rather
handsome
poetical
and
beautiful
that
he
could
get
off
by
heart
and
deliver
as
if
it
were
the
thought
of
the
moment
he
had
not
had
my
experience
and
could
not
do
that
he
came
on
the
platform
held
his
manuscript
down
and
began
with
a
beautiful
piece
of
oratory
he
spoke
something
like
this
when
a
lonely
human
being
a
pigmy
in
the
midst
of
the
architecture
of
nature
stands
solitary
on
those
icy
waters
and
looks
abroad
to
the
horizon
and
sees
mighty
castles
and
temples
of
eternal
ice
raising
up
their
pinnacles
tipped
by
the
pencil
of
the
departing
sun
here
a
man
came
across
the
platform
and
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
and
said
one
minute
and
then
to
the
audience
is
mrs
john
smith
in
the
house
her
husband
has
slipped
on
the
ice
and
broken
his
leg
and
you
could
see
the
mrs
john
smiths
get
up
everywhere
and
drift
out
of
the
house
and
it
made
great
gaps
everywhere
then
doctor
hayes
began
again
when
a
lonely
man
a
pigmy
in
the
architecture
the
janitor
came
in
again
and
shouted
it
is
not
mrs
john
smith
it
is
mrs
john
jones
then
all
the
mrs
jones
got
up
and
left
once
more
the
speaker
started
and
was
in
the
midst
of
the
sentence
when
he
was
interrupted
again
and
the
result
was
that
the
lecture
was
not
delivered
but
the
lecturer
interviewed
the
janitor
afterward
in
a
private
room
and
of
the
fragments
of
the
janitor
they
took
twelve
basketsful
now
i
don't
want
to
sit
down
just
in
this
way
i
have
been
talking
with
so
much
levity
that
i
have
said
no
serious
thing
and
you
are
really
no
better
or
wiser
although
robert
buchanan
has
suggested
that
i
am
a
person
who
deals
in
wisdom
i
have
said
nothing
which
would
make
you
better
than
when
you
came
here
i
should
be
sorry
to
sit
down
without
having
said
one
serious
word
which
you
can
carry
home
and
relate
to
your
children
and
the
old
people
who
are
not
able
to
get
away
and
this
is
just
a
little
maxim
which
has
saved
me
from
many
a
difficulty
and
many
a
disaster
and
in
times
of
tribulation
and
uncertainty
has
come
to
my
rescue
as
it
shall
to
yours
if
you
observe
it
as
i
do
day
and
night
i
always
use
it
in
an
emergency
and
you
can
take
it
home
as
a
legacy
from
me
and
it
is
when
in
doubt
tell
the
truth
the
ascot
gold
cup
the
news
of
mr
clemens's
arrival
in
england
in
june
was
announced
in
the
papers
with
big
headlines
immediately
following
the
announcement
was
the
news
also
with
big
headlines
that
the
ascot
gold
cup
had
been
stolen
the
same
day
the
combination
mark
twain
arrives
ascot
cup
stolen
amused
the
public
the
lord
mayor
of
london
gave
a
banquet
at
the
mansion
house
in
honor
of
mr
clemens
i
do
assure
you
that
i
am
not
so
dishonest
as
i
look
i
have
been
so
busy
trying
to
rehabilitate
my
honor
about
that
ascot
cup
that
i
have
had
no
time
to
prepare
a
speech
i
was
not
so
honest
in
former
days
as
i
am
now
but
i
have
always
been
reasonably
honest
well
you
know
how
a
man
is
influenced
by
his
surroundings
once
upon
a
time
i
went
to
a
public
meeting
where
the
oratory
of
a
charitable
worker
so
worked
on
my
feelings
that
in
common
with
others
i
would
have
dropped
something
substantial
in
the
hat
if
it
had
come
round
at
that
moment
the
speaker
had
the
power
of
putting
those
vivid
pictures
before
one
we
were
all
affected
that
was
the
moment
for
the
hat
i
would
have
put
two
hundred
dollars
in
before
he
had
finished
i
could
have
put
in
four
hundred
dollars
i
felt
i
could
have
filled
up
a
blank
check
with
somebody
else's
name
and
dropped
it
in
well
now
another
speaker
got
up
and
in
fifteen
minutes
damped
my
spirit
and
during
the
speech
of
the
third
speaker
all
my
enthusiasm
went
away
when
at
last
the
hat
came
round
i
dropped
in
ten
cents
and
took
out
twenty
five
i
came
over
here
to
get
the
honorary
degree
from
oxford
and
i
would
have
encompassed
the
seven
seas
for
an
honor
like
that
the
greatest
honor
that
has
ever
fallen
to
my
share
i
am
grateful
to
oxford
for
conferring
that
honor
upon
me
and
i
am
sure
my
country
appreciates
it
because
first
and
foremost
it
is
an
honor
to
my
country
and
now
i
am
going
home
again
across
the
sea
i
am
in
spirit
young
but
in
the
flesh
old
so
that
it
is
unlikely
that
when
i
go
away
i
shall
ever
see
england
again
but
i
shall
go
with
the
recollection
of
the
generous
and
kindly
welcome
i
have
had
i
suppose
i
must
say
good
bye
i
say
it
not
with
my
lips
only
but
from
the
heart
the
savage
club
dinner
a
portrait
of
mr
clemens
signed
by
all
the
members
of
the
club
attending
the
dinner
was
presented
to
him
july
and
in
submitting
the
toast
the
health
of
mark
twain
mr
j
scott
stokes
recalled
the
fact
that
he
had
read
parts
of
doctor
clemens's
works
to
harold
frederic
during
frederic's
last
illness
mr
chairman
and
fellow
savages
i
am
very
glad
indeed
to
have
that
portrait
i
think
it
is
the
best
one
that
i
have
ever
had
and
there
have
been
opportunities
before
to
get
a
good
photograph
i
have
sat
to
photographers
twenty
two
times
to
day
those
sittings
added
to
those
that
have
preceded
them
since
i
have
been
in
europe
if
we
average
at
that
rate
must
have
numbered
one
hundred
to
two
hundred
sittings
out
of
all
those
there
ought
to
be
some
good
photographs
this
is
the
best
i
have
had
and
i
am
glad
to
have
your
honored
names
on
it
i
did
not
know
harold
frederic
personally
but
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
him
and
nothing
that
was
not
pleasant
and
nothing
except
such
things
as
lead
a
man
to
honor
another
man
and
to
love
him
i
consider
that
it
is
a
misfortune
of
mine
that
i
have
never
had
the
luck
to
meet
him
and
if
any
book
of
mine
read
to
him
in
his
last
hours
made
those
hours
easier
for
him
and
more
comfortable
i
am
very
glad
and
proud
of
that
i
call
to
mind
such
a
case
many
years
ago
of
an
english
authoress
well
known
in
her
day
who
wrote
such
beautiful
child
tales
touching
and
lovely
in
every
possible
way
in
a
little
biographical
sketch
of
her
i
found
that
her
last
hours
were
spent
partly
in
reading
a
book
of
mine
until
she
was
no
longer
able
to
read
that
has
always
remained
in
my
mind
and
i
have
always
cherished
it
as
one
of
the
good
things
of
my
life
i
had
read
what
she
had
written
and
had
loved
her
for
what
she
had
done
stanley
apparently
carried
a
book
of
mine
feloniously
away
to
africa
and
i
have
not
a
doubt
that
it
had
a
noble
and
uplifting
influence
there
in
the
wilds
of
africa
because
on
his
previous
journeys
he
never
carried
anything
to
read
except
shakespeare
and
the
bible
i
did
not
know
of
that
circumstance
i
did
not
know
that
he
had
carried
a
book
of
mine
i
only
noticed
that
when
he
came
back
he
was
a
reformed
man
i
knew
stanley
very
well
in
those
old
days
stanley
was
the
first
man
who
ever
reported
a
lecture
of
mine
and
that
was
in
st
louis
when
i
was
down
there
the
next
time
to
give
the
same
lecture
i
was
told
to
give
them
something
fresh
as
they
had
read
that
in
the
papers
i
met
stanley
here
when
he
came
back
from
that
first
expedition
of
his
which
closed
with
the
finding
of
livingstone
you
remember
how
he
would
break
out
at
the
meetings
of
the
british
association
and
find
fault
with
what
people
said
because
stanley
had
notions
of
his
own
and
could
not
contain
them
they
had
to
come
out
or
break
him
up
and
so
he
would
go
round
and
address
geographical
societies
he
was
always
on
the
warpath
in
those
days
and
people
always
had
to
have
stanley
contradicting
their
geography
for
them
and
improving
it
but
he
always
came
back
and
sat
drinking
beer
with
me
in
the
hotel
up
to
two
in
the
morning
and
he
was
then
one
of
the
most
civilized
human
beings
that
ever
was
i
saw
in
a
newspaper
this
evening
a
reference
to
an
interview
which
appeared
in
one
of
the
papers
the
other
day
in
which
the
interviewer
said
that
i
characterized
mr
birrell's
speech
the
other
day
at
the
pilgrims
club
as
bully
now
if
you
will
excuse
me
i
never
use
slang
to
an
interviewer
or
anybody
else
that
distresses
me
whatever
i
said
about
mr
birrell's
speech
was
said
in
english
as
good
english
as
anybody
uses
if
i
could
not
describe
mr
birrell's
delightful
speech
without
using
slang
i
would
not
describe
it
at
all
i
would
close
my
mouth
and
keep
it
closed
much
as
it
would
discomfort
me
now
that
comes
of
interviewing
a
man
in
the
first
person
which
is
an
altogether
wrong
way
to
interview
him
it
is
entirely
wrong
because
none
of
you
i
or
anybody
else
could
interview
a
man
could
listen
to
a
man
talking
any
length
of
time
and
then
go
off
and
reproduce
that
talk
in
the
first
person
it
can't
be
done
what
results
is
merely
that
the
interviewer
gives
the
substance
of
what
is
said
and
puts
it
in
his
own
language
and
puts
it
in
your
mouth
it
will
always
be
either
better
language
than
you
use
or
worse
and
in
my
case
it
is
always
worse
i
have
a
great
respect
for
the
english
language
i
am
one
of
its
supporters
its
promoters
its
elevators
i
don't
degrade
it
a
slip
of
the
tongue
would
be
the
most
that
you
would
get
from
me
i
have
always
tried
hard
and
faithfully
to
improve
my
english
and
never
to
degrade
it
i
always
try
to
use
the
best
english
to
describe
what
i
think
and
what
i
feel
or
what
i
don't
feel
and
what
i
don't
think
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
in
expressing
opinions
confine
themselves
to
facts
i
don't
know
anything
that
mars
good
literature
so
completely
as
too
much
truth
facts
contain
a
deal
of
poetry
but
you
can't
use
too
many
of
them
without
damaging
your
literature
i
love
all
literature
and
as
long
as
i
am
a
doctor
of
literature
i
have
suggested
to
you
for
twenty
years
i
have
been
diligently
trying
to
improve
my
own
literature
and
now
by
virtue
of
the
university
of
oxford
i
mean
to
doctor
everybody
else's
now
i
think
i
ought
to
apologize
for
my
clothes
at
home
i
venture
things
that
i
am
not
permitted
by
my
family
to
venture
in
foreign
parts
i
was
instructed
before
i
left
home
and
ordered
to
refrain
from
white
clothes
in
england
i
meant
to
keep
that
command
fair
and
clean
and
i
would
have
done
it
if
i
had
been
in
the
habit
of
obeying
instructions
but
i
can't
invent
a
new
process
in
life
right
away
i
have
not
had
white
clothes
on
since
i
crossed
the
ocean
until
now
in
these
three
or
four
weeks
i
have
grown
so
tired
of
gray
and
black
that
you
have
earned
my
gratitude
in
permitting
me
to
come
as
i
have
i
wear
white
clothes
in
the
depth
of
winter
in
my
home
but
i
don't
go
out
in
the
streets
in
them
i
don't
go
out
to
attract
too
much
attention
i
like
to
attract
some
and
always
i
would
like
to
be
dressed
so
that
i
may
be
more
conspicuous
than
anybody
else
if
i
had
been
an
ancient
briton
i
would
not
have
contented
myself
with
blue
paint
but
i
would
have
bankrupted
the
rainbow
i
so
enjoy
gay
clothes
in
which
women
clothe
themselves
that
it
always
grieves
me
when
i
go
to
the
opera
to
see
that
while
women
look
like
a
flower
bed
the
men
are
a
few
gray
stumps
among
them
in
their
black
evening
dress
these
are
two
or
three
reasons
why
i
wish
to
wear
white
clothes
when
i
find
myself
in
assemblies
like
this
with
everybody
in
black
clothes
i
know
i
possess
something
that
is
superior
to
everybody
else's
clothes
are
never
clean
you
don't
know
whether
they
are
clean
or
not
because
you
can't
see
here
or
anywhere
you
must
scour
your
head
every
two
or
three
days
or
it
is
full
of
grit
your
clothes
must
collect
just
as
much
dirt
as
your
hair
if
you
wear
white
clothes
you
are
clean
and
your
cleaning
bill
gets
so
heavy
that
you
have
to
take
care
i
am
proud
to
say
that
i
can
wear
a
white
suit
of
clothes
without
a
blemish
for
three
days
if
you
need
any
further
instruction
in
the
matter
of
clothes
i
shall
be
glad
to
give
it
to
you
i
hope
i
have
convinced
some
of
you
that
it
is
just
as
well
to
wear
white
clothes
as
any
other
kind
i
do
not
want
to
boast
i
only
want
to
make
you
understand
that
you
are
not
clean
as
to
age
the
fact
that
i
am
nearly
seventy
two
years
old
does
not
clearly
indicate
how
old
i
am
because
part
of
every
day
it
is
with
me
as
with
you
you
try
to
describe
your
age
and
you
cannot
do
it
sometimes
you
are
only
fifteen
sometimes
you
are
twenty
five
it
is
very
seldom
in
a
day
that
i
am
seventy
two
years
old
i
am
older
now
sometimes
than
i
was
when
i
used
to
rob
orchards
a
thing
which
i
would
not
do
to
day
if
the
orchards
were
watched
i
am
so
glad
to
be
here
to
night
i
am
so
glad
to
renew
with
the
savages
that
now
ancient
time
when
i
first
sat
with
a
company
of
this
club
in
london
in
that
is
a
long
time
ago
but
i
did
stay
with
the
savages
a
night
in
london
long
ago
and
as
i
had
come
into
a
very
strange
land
and
was
with
friends
as
i
could
see
that
has
always
remained
in
my
mind
as
a
peculiarly
blessed
evening
since
it
brought
me
into
contact
with
men
of
my
own
kind
and
my
own
feelings
i
am
glad
to
be
here
and
to
see
you
all
again
because
it
is
very
likely
that
i
shall
not
see
you
again
it
is
easier
than
i
thought
to
come
across
the
atlantic
i
have
been
received
as
you
know
in
the
most
delightfully
generous
way
in
england
ever
since
i
came
here
it
keeps
me
choked
up
all
the
time
everybody
is
so
generous
and
they
do
seem
to
give
you
such
a
hearty
welcome
nobody
in
the
world
can
appreciate
it
higher
than
i
do
it
did
not
wait
till
i
got
to
london
but
when
i
came
ashore
at
tilbury
the
stevedores
on
the
dock
raised
the
first
welcome
a
good
and
hearty
welcome
from
the
men
who
do
the
heavy
labor
in
the
world
and
save
you
and
me
having
to
do
it
they
are
the
men
who
with
their
hands
build
empires
and
make
them
prosper
it
is
because
of
them
that
the
others
are
wealthy
and
can
live
in
luxury
they
received
me
with
a
hurrah
that
went
to
my
heart
they
are
the
men
that
build
civilization
and
without
them
no
civilization
can
be
built
so
i
came
first
to
the
authors
and
creators
of
civilization
and
i
blessedly
end
this
happy
meeting
with
the
savages
who
destroy
it
general
miles
and
the
dog
mr
clemens
was
the
guest
of
honor
at
a
dinner
given
by
the
pleiades
club
at
the
hotel
brevoort
december
the
toastmaster
introduced
the
guest
of
the
evening
with
a
high
tribute
to
his
place
in
american
literature
saying
that
he
was
dear
to
the
hearts
of
all
americans
it
is
hard
work
to
make
a
speech
when
you
have
listened
to
compliments
from
the
powers
in
authority
a
compliment
is
a
hard
text
to
preach
to
when
the
chairman
introduces
me
as
a
person
of
merit
and
when
he
says
pleasant
things
about
me
i
always
feel
like
answering
simply
that
what
he
says
is
true
that
it
is
all
right
that
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
the
things
he
said
can
stand
as
they
are
but
you
always
have
to
say
something
and
that
is
what
frightens
me
i
remember
out
in
sydney
once
having
to
respond
to
some
complimentary
toast
and
my
one
desire
was
to
turn
in
my
tracks
like
any
other
worm
and
run
for
it
i
was
remembering
that
occasion
at
a
later
date
when
i
had
to
introduce
a
speaker
hoping
then
to
spur
his
speech
by
putting
him
in
joke
on
the
defensive
i
accused
him
in
my
introduction
of
everything
i
thought
it
impossible
for
him
to
have
committed
when
i
finished
there
was
an
awful
calm
i
had
been
telling
his
life
history
by
mistake
one
must
keep
up
one's
character
earn
a
character
first
if
you
can
and
if
you
can't
then
assume
one
from
the
code
of
morals
i
have
been
following
and
revising
and
revising
for
seventy
two
years
i
remember
one
detail
all
my
life
i
have
been
honest
comparatively
honest
i
could
never
use
money
i
had
not
made
honestly
i
could
only
lend
it
last
spring
i
met
general
miles
again
and
he
commented
on
the
fact
that
we
had
known
each
other
thirty
years
he
said
it
was
strange
that
we
had
not
met
years
before
when
we
had
both
been
in
washington
at
that
point
i
changed
the
subject
and
i
changed
it
with
art
but
the
facts
are
these
i
was
then
under
contract
for
my
innocents
abroad
but
did
not
have
a
cent
to
live
on
while
i
wrote
it
so
i
went
to
washington
to
do
a
little
journalism
there
i
met
an
equally
poor
friend
william
davidson
who
had
not
a
single
vice
unless
you
call
it
a
vice
in
a
scot
to
love
scotch
together
we
devised
the
first
and
original
newspaper
syndicate
selling
two
letters
a
week
to
twelve
newspapers
and
getting
a
letter
that
a
week
would
have
been
enough
for
us
if
we
had
not
had
to
support
the
jug
but
there
was
a
day
when
we
felt
that
we
must
have
right
away
at
once
that
was
how
i
met
the
general
it
doesn't
matter
now
what
we
wanted
so
much
money
at
one
time
for
but
that
scot
and
i
did
occasionally
want
it
the
scot
sent
me
out
one
day
to
get
it
he
had
a
great
belief
in
providence
that
scottish
friend
of
mine
he
said
the
lord
will
provide
i
had
given
up
trying
to
find
the
money
lying
about
and
was
in
a
hotel
lobby
in
despair
when
i
saw
a
beautiful
unfriended
dog
the
dog
saw
me
too
and
at
once
we
became
acquainted
then
general
miles
came
in
admired
the
dog
and
asked
me
to
price
it
i
priced
it
at
he
offered
me
an
opportunity
to
reconsider
the
value
of
the
beautiful
animal
but
i
refused
to
take
more
than
providence
knew
i
needed
the
general
carried
the
dog
to
his
room
then
came
in
a
sweet
little
middle
aged
man
who
at
once
began
looking
around
the
lobby
did
you
lose
a
dog
i
asked
he
said
he
had
i
think
i
could
find
it
i
volunteered
for
a
small
sum
how
much
he
asked
and
i
told
him
he
urged
me
to
accept
more
but
i
did
not
wish
to
outdo
providence
then
i
went
to
the
general's
room
and
asked
for
the
dog
back
he
was
very
angry
and
wanted
to
know
why
i
had
sold
him
a
dog
that
did
not
belong
to
me
that's
a
singular
question
to
ask
me
sir
i
replied
didn't
you
ask
me
to
sell
him
you
started
it
and
he
let
me
have
him
i
gave
him
back
his
and
returned
the
dog
collect
to
its
owner
that
second
i
carried
home
to
the
scot
and
we
enjoyed
it
but
the
first
the
money
i
got
from
the
general
i
would
have
had
to
lend
the
general
seemed
not
to
remember
my
part
in
that
adventure
and
i
never
had
the
heart
to
tell
him
about
it
when
in
doubt
tell
the
truth
mark
twain's
speech
at
the
dinner
of
the
freundschaft
society
march
had
as
a
basis
the
words
of
introduction
used
by
toastmaster
frank
who
referring
to
pudd'nhead
wilson
used
the
phrase
when
in
doubt
tell
the
truth
mr
chairman
mr
putzel
and
gentlemen
of
the
freundschaft
that
maxim
i
did
invent
but
never
expected
it
to
be
applied
to
me
i
did
say
when
you
are
in
doubt
but
when
i
am
in
doubt
myself
i
use
more
sagacity
mr
grout
suggested
that
if
i
have
anything
to
say
against
mr
putzel
or
any
criticism
of
his
career
or
his
character
i
am
the
last
person
to
come
out
on
account
of
that
maxim
and
tell
the
truth
that
is
altogether
a
mistake
i
do
think
it
is
right
for
other
people
to
be
virtuous
so
that
they
can
be
happy
hereafter
but
if
i
knew
every
impropriety
that
even
mr
putzel
has
committed
in
his
life
i
would
not
mention
one
of
them
my
judgment
has
been
maturing
for
seventy
years
and
i
have
got
to
that
point
where
i
know
better
than
that
mr
putzel
stands
related
to
me
in
a
very
tender
way
through
the
tax
office
and
it
does
not
behoove
me
to
say
anything
which
could
by
any
possibility
militate
against
that
condition
of
things
now
that
word
taxes
taxes
taxes
i
have
heard
it
to
night
i
have
heard
it
all
night
i
wish
somebody
would
change
that
subject
that
is
a
very
sore
subject
to
me
i
was
so
relieved
when
judge
leventritt
did
find
something
that
was
not
taxable
when
he
said
that
the
commissioner
could
not
tax
your
patience
and
that
comforted
me
we've
got
so
much
taxation
i
don't
know
of
a
single
foreign
product
that
enters
this
country
untaxed
except
the
answer
to
prayer
on
an
occasion
like
this
the
proprieties
require
that
you
merely
pay
compliments
to
the
guest
of
the
occasion
and
i
am
merely
here
to
pay
compliments
to
the
guest
of
the
occasion
not
to
criticise
him
in
any
way
and
i
can
say
only
complimentary
things
to
him
when
i
went
down
to
the
tax
office
some
time
ago
for
the
first
time
in
new
york
i
saw
mr
putzel
sitting
in
the
seat
of
perjury
i
recognized
him
right
away
i
warmed
to
him
on
the
spot
i
didn't
know
that
i
had
ever
seen
him
before
but
just
as
soon
as
i
saw
him
i
recognized
him
i
had
met
him
twenty
five
years
before
and
at
that
time
had
achieved
a
knowledge
of
his
abilities
and
something
more
than
that
i
thought
now
this
is
the
man
whom
i
saw
twenty
five
years
ago
on
that
occasion
i
not
only
went
free
at
his
hands
but
carried
off
something
more
than
that
i
hoped
it
would
happen
again
it
was
twenty
five
years
ago
when
i
saw
a
young
clerk
in
putnam's
bookstore
i
went
in
there
and
asked
for
george
haven
putnam
and
handed
him
my
card
and
then
the
young
man
said
mr
putnam
was
busy
and
i
couldn't
see
him
well
i
had
merely
called
in
a
social
way
and
so
it
didn't
matter
i
was
going
out
when
i
saw
a
great
big
fat
interesting
looking
book
lying
there
and
i
took
it
up
it
was
an
account
of
the
invasion
of
england
in
the
fourteenth
century
by
the
preaching
friar
and
it
interested
me
i
asked
him
the
price
of
it
and
he
said
four
dollars
well
i
said
what
discount
do
you
allow
to
publishers
he
said
forty
percent
off
i
said
all
right
i
am
a
publisher
he
put
down
the
figure
forty
per
cent
off
on
a
card
then
i
said
what
discount
do
you
allow
to
authors
he
said
forty
per
cent
off
well
i
said
set
me
down
as
an
author
now
said
i
what
discount
do
you
allow
to
the
clergy
he
said
forty
per
cent
off
i
said
to
him
that
i
was
only
on
the
road
and
that
i
was
studying
for
the
ministry
i
asked
him
wouldn't
he
knock
off
twenty
per
cent
for
that
he
set
down
the
figure
and
he
never
smiled
once
i
was
working
off
these
humorous
brilliancies
on
him
and
getting
no
return
not
a
scintillation
in
his
eye
not
a
spark
of
recognition
of
what
i
was
doing
there
i
was
almost
in
despair
i
thought
i
might
try
him
once
more
so
i
said
now
i
am
also
a
member
of
the
human
race
will
you
let
me
have
the
ten
per
cent
off
for
that
he
set
it
down
and
never
smiled
well
i
gave
it
up
i
said
there
is
my
card
with
my
address
on
it
but
i
have
not
any
money
with
me
will
you
please
send
the
bill
to
hartford
i
took
up
the
book
and
was
going
away
he
said
wait
a
minute
there
is
forty
cents
coming
to
you
when
i
met
him
in
the
tax
office
i
thought
maybe
i
could
make
something
again
but
i
could
not
but
i
had
not
any
idea
i
could
when
i
came
and
as
it
turned
out
i
did
get
off
entirely
free
i
put
up
my
hand
and
made
a
statement
it
gave
me
a
good
deal
of
pain
to
do
that
i
was
not
used
to
it
i
was
born
and
reared
in
the
higher
circles
of
missouri
and
there
we
don't
do
such
things
didn't
in
my
time
but
we
have
got
that
little
matter
settled
got
a
sort
of
tax
levied
on
me
then
he
touched
me
yes
he
touched
me
this
time
because
he
cried
cried
he
was
moved
to
tears
to
see
that
i
a
virtuous
person
only
a
year
before
after
immersion
for
one
year
during
one
year
in
the
new
york
morals
had
no
more
conscience
than
a
millionaire
the
day
we
celebrate
address
at
the
fourth
of
july
dinner
of
the
american
society
london
i
noticed
in
ambassador
choate's
speech
that
he
said
you
may
be
americans
or
englishmen
but
you
cannot
be
both
at
the
same
time
you
responded
by
applause
consider
the
effect
of
a
short
residence
here
i
find
the
ambassador
rises
first
to
speak
to
a
toast
followed
by
a
senator
and
i
come
third
what
a
subtle
tribute
that
to
monarchial
influence
of
the
country
when
you
place
rank
above
respectability
i
was
born
modest
and
if
i
had
not
been
things
like
this
would
force
it
upon
me
i
understand
it
quite
well
i
am
here
to
see
that
between
them
they
do
justice
to
the
day
we
celebrate
and
in
case
they
do
not
i
must
do
it
myself
but
i
notice
they
have
considered
this
day
merely
from
one
side
its
sentimental
patriotic
poetic
side
but
it
has
another
side
it
has
a
commercial
a
business
side
that
needs
reforming
it
has
a
historical
side
i
do
not
say
an
historical
side
because
i
am
speaking
the
american
language
i
do
not
see
why
our
cousins
should
continue
to
say
an
hospital
an
historical
fact
an
horse
it
seems
to
me
the
congress
of
women
now
in
session
should
look
to
it
i
think
an
is
having
a
little
too
much
to
do
with
it
it
comes
of
habit
which
accounts
for
many
things
yesterday
for
example
i
was
at
a
luncheon
party
at
the
end
of
the
party
a
great
dignitary
of
the
english
established
church
went
away
half
an
hour
before
anybody
else
and
carried
off
my
hat
now
that
was
an
innocent
act
on
his
part
he
went
out
first
and
of
course
had
the
choice
of
hats
as
a
rule
i
try
to
get
out
first
myself
but
i
hold
that
it
was
an
innocent
unconscious
act
due
perhaps
to
heredity
he
was
thinking
about
ecclesiastical
matters
and
when
a
man
is
in
that
condition
of
mind
he
will
take
anybody's
hat
the
result
was
that
the
whole
afternoon
i
was
under
the
influence
of
his
clerical
hat
and
could
not
tell
a
lie
of
course
he
was
hard
at
it
it
is
a
compliment
to
both
of
us
his
hat
fitted
me
exactly
my
hat
fitted
him
exactly
so
i
judge
i
was
born
to
rise
to
high
dignity
in
the
church
some
how
or
other
but
i
do
not
know
what
he
was
born
for
that
is
an
illustration
of
the
influence
of
habit
and
it
is
perceptible
here
when
they
say
an
hospital
an
european
an
historical
the
business
aspects
of
the
fourth
of
july
is
not
perfect
as
it
stands
see
what
it
costs
us
every
year
with
loss
of
life
the
crippling
of
thousands
with
its
fireworks
and
the
burning
down
of
property
it
is
not
only
sacred
to
patriotism
and
universal
freedom
but
to
the
surgeon
the
undertaker
the
insurance
offices
and
they
are
working
it
for
all
it
is
worth
i
am
pleased
to
see
that
we
have
a
cessation
of
war
for
the
time
this
coming
from
me
a
soldier
you
will
appreciate
i
was
a
soldier
in
the
southern
war
for
two
weeks
and
when
gentlemen
get
up
to
speak
of
the
great
deeds
our
army
and
navy
have
recently
done
why
it
goes
all
through
me
and
fires
up
the
old
war
spirit
i
had
in
my
first
engagement
three
horses
shot
under
me
the
next
ones
went
over
my
head
the
next
hit
me
in
the
back
then
i
retired
to
meet
an
engagement
i
thank
you
gentlemen
for
making
even
a
slight
reference
to
the
war
profession
in
which
i
distinguished
myself
short
as
my
career
was
independence
day
the
american
society
in
london
gave
a
banquet
july
at
the
hotel
cecil
ambassador
choate
called
on
mr
clemens
to
respond
to
the
toast
the
day
we
celebrate
mr
chairman
my
lord
and
gentlemen
once
more
it
happens
as
it
has
happened
so
often
since
i
arrived
in
england
a
week
or
two
ago
that
instead
of
celebrating
the
fourth
of
july
properly
as
has
been
indicated
i
have
to
first
take
care
of
my
personal
character
sir
mortimer
durand
still
remains
unconvinced
well
i
tried
to
convince
these
people
from
the
beginning
that
i
did
not
take
the
ascot
cup
and
as
i
have
failed
to
convince
anybody
that
i
did
not
take
the
cup
i
might
as
well
confess
i
did
take
it
and
be
done
with
it
i
don't
see
why
this
uncharitable
feeling
should
follow
me
everywhere
and
why
i
should
have
that
crime
thrown
up
to
me
on
all
occasions
the
tears
that
i
have
wept
over
it
ought
to
have
created
a
different
feeling
than
this
and
besides
i
don't
think
it
is
very
right
or
fair
that
considering
england
has
been
trying
to
take
a
cup
of
ours
for
forty
years
i
don't
see
why
they
should
take
so
much
trouble
when
i
tried
to
go
into
the
business
myself
sir
mortimer
durand
too
has
had
trouble
from
going
to
a
dinner
here
and
he
has
told
you
what
he
suffered
in
consequence
but
what
did
he
suffer
he
only
missed
his
train
and
one
night
of
discomfort
and
he
remembers
it
to
this
day
oh
if
you
could
only
think
what
i
have
suffered
from
a
similar
circumstance
two
or
three
years
ago
in
new
york
with
that
society
there
which
is
made
up
of
people
from
all
british
colonies
and
from
great
britain
generally
who
were
educated
in
british
colleges
and
british
schools
i
was
there
to
respond
to
a
toast
of
some
kind
or
other
and
i
did
then
what
i
have
been
in
the
habit
of
doing
from
a
selfish
motive
for
a
long
time
and
that
is
i
got
myself
placed
no
in
the
list
of
speakers
then
you
get
home
early
i
had
to
go
five
miles
up
river
and
had
to
catch
a
particular
train
or
not
get
there
but
see
the
magnanimity
which
is
born
in
me
which
i
have
cultivated
all
my
life
a
very
famous
and
very
great
british
clergyman
came
to
me
presently
and
he
said
i
am
away
down
in
the
list
i
have
got
to
catch
a
certain
train
this
saturday
night
if
i
don't
catch
that
train
i
shall
be
carried
beyond
midnight
and
break
the
sabbath
won't
you
change
places
with
me
i
said
certainly
i
will
i
did
it
at
once
now
see
what
happened
talk
about
sir
mortimer
durand's
sufferings
for
a
single
night
i
have
suffered
ever
since
because
i
saved
that
gentleman
from
breaking
the
sabbath
yes
saved
him
i
took
his
place
but
i
lost
my
train
and
it
was
i
who
broke
the
sabbath
up
to
that
time
i
never
had
broken
the
sabbath
in
my
life
and
from
that
day
to
this
i
never
have
kept
it
oh
i
am
learning
much
here
to
night
i
find
i
didn't
know
anything
about
the
american
society
that
is
i
didn't
know
its
chief
virtue
i
didn't
know
its
chief
virtue
until
his
excellency
our
ambassador
revealed
it
i
may
say
exposed
it
i
was
intending
to
go
home
on
the
of
this
month
but
i
look
upon
that
in
a
different
light
now
i
am
going
to
stay
here
until
the
american
society
pays
my
passage
our
ambassador
has
spoken
of
our
fourth
of
july
and
the
noise
it
makes
we
have
got
a
double
fourth
of
july
a
daylight
fourth
and
a
midnight
fourth
during
the
day
in
america
as
our
ambassador
has
indicated
we
keep
the
fourth
of
july
properly
in
a
reverent
spirit
we
devote
it
to
teaching
our
children
patriotic
things
reverence
for
the
declaration
of
independence
we
honor
the
day
all
through
the
daylight
hours
and
when
night
comes
we
dishonor
it
presently
before
long
they
are
getting
nearly
ready
to
begin
now
on
the
atlantic
coast
when
night
shuts
down
that
pandemonium
will
begin
and
there
will
be
noise
and
noise
and
noise
all
night
long
and
there
will
be
more
than
noise
there
will
be
people
crippled
there
will
be
people
killed
there
will
be
people
who
will
lose
their
eyes
and
all
through
that
permission
which
we
give
to
irresponsible
boys
to
play
with
firearms
and
fire
crackers
and
all
sorts
of
dangerous
things
we
turn
that
fourth
of
july
alas
over
to
rowdies
to
drink
and
get
drunk
and
make
the
night
hideous
and
we
cripple
and
kill
more
people
than
you
would
imagine
we
probably
began
to
celebrate
our
fourth
of
july
night
in
that
way
one
hundred
and
twenty
five
years
ago
and
on
every
fourth
of
july
night
since
these
horrors
have
grown
and
grown
until
now
in
our
five
thousand
towns
of
america
somebody
gets
killed
or
crippled
on
every
fourth
of
july
night
besides
those
cases
of
sick
persons
whom
we
never
hear
of
who
die
as
the
result
of
the
noise
or
the
shock
they
cripple
and
kill
more
people
on
the
fourth
of
july
in
america
than
they
kill
and
cripple
in
our
wars
nowadays
and
there
are
no
pensions
for
these
folk
and
too
we
burn
houses
really
we
destroy
more
property
on
every
fourth
of
july
night
than
the
whole
of
the
united
states
was
worth
one
hundred
and
twenty
five
years
ago
really
our
fourth
of
july
is
our
day
of
mourning
our
day
of
sorrow
fifty
thousand
people
who
have
lost
friends
or
who
have
had
friends
crippled
receive
that
fourth
of
july
when
it
comes
as
a
day
of
mourning
for
the
losses
they
have
sustained
in
their
families
i
have
suffered
in
that
way
myself
i
have
had
relatives
killed
in
that
way
one
was
in
chicago
years
ago
an
uncle
of
mine
just
as
good
an
uncle
as
i
have
ever
had
and
i
had
lots
of
them
yes
uncles
to
burn
uncles
to
spare
this
poor
uncle
full
of
patriotism
opened
his
mouth
to
hurrah
and
a
rocket
went
down
his
throat
before
that
man
could
ask
for
a
drink
of
water
to
quench
that
thing
it
blew
up
and
scattered
him
all
over
the
forty
five
states
and
really
now
this
is
true
i
know
about
it
myself
twenty
four
hours
after
that
it
was
raining
buttons
recognizable
as
his
on
the
atlantic
seaboard
a
person
cannot
have
a
disaster
like
that
and
be
entirely
cheerful
the
rest
of
his
life
i
had
another
uncle
on
an
entirely
different
fourth
of
july
who
was
blown
up
that
way
and
really
it
trimmed
him
as
it
would
a
tree
he
had
hardly
a
limb
left
on
him
anywhere
all
we
have
left
now
is
an
expurgated
edition
of
that
uncle
but
never
mind
about
these
things
they
are
merely
passing
matters
don't
let
me
make
you
sad
sir
mortimer
durand
said
that
you
the
english
people
gave
up
your
colonies
over
there
got
tired
of
them
and
did
it
with
reluctance
now
i
wish
you
just
to
consider
that
he
was
right
about
that
and
that
he
had
his
reasons
for
saying
that
england
did
not
look
upon
our
revolution
as
a
foreign
war
but
as
a
civil
war
fought
by
englishmen
our
fourth
of
july
which
we
honor
so
much
and
which
we
love
so
much
and
which
we
take
so
much
pride
in
is
an
english
institution
not
an
american
one
and
it
comes
of
a
great
ancestry
the
first
fourth
of
july
in
that
noble
genealogy
dates
back
seven
centuries
lacking
eight
years
that
is
the
day
of
the
great
charter
the
magna
charta
which
was
born
at
runnymede
in
the
next
to
the
last
year
of
king
john
and
portions
of
the
liberties
secured
thus
by
those
hardy
barons
from
that
reluctant
king
john
are
a
part
of
our
declaration
of
independence
of
our
fourth
of
july
of
our
american
liberties
and
the
second
of
those
fourths
of
july
was
not
born
until
four
centuries
later
in
charles
the
first's
time
in
the
bill
of
rights
and
that
is
ours
that
is
part
of
our
liberties
the
next
one
was
still
english
in
new
england
where
they
established
that
principle
which
remains
with
us
to
this
day
and
will
continue
to
remain
with
us
no
taxation
without
representation
that
is
always
going
to
stand
and
that
the
english
colonies
in
new
england
gave
us
the
fourth
of
july
and
the
one
which
you
are
celebrating
now
born
in
philadelphia
on
the
of
july
that
is
english
too
it
is
not
american
those
were
english
colonists
subjects
of
king
george
iii
englishmen
at
heart
who
protested
against
the
oppressions
of
the
home
government
though
they
proposed
to
cure
those
oppressions
and
remove
them
still
remaining
under
the
crown
they
were
not
intending
a
revolution
the
revolution
was
brought
about
by
circumstances
which
they
could
not
control
the
declaration
of
independence
was
written
by
a
british
subject
every
name
signed
to
it
was
the
name
of
a
british
subject
there
was
not
the
name
of
a
single
american
attached
to
the
declaration
of
independence
in
fact
there
was
not
an
american
in
the
country
in
that
day
except
the
indians
out
on
the
plains
they
were
englishmen
all
englishmen
americans
did
not
begin
until
seven
years
later
when
that
fourth
of
july
had
become
seven
years
old
and
then
the
american
republic
was
established
since
then
there
have
been
americans
so
you
see
what
we
owe
to
england
in
the
matter
of
liberties
we
have
however
one
fourth
of
july
which
is
absolutely
our
own
and
that
is
that
great
proclamation
issued
forty
years
ago
by
that
great
american
to
whom
sir
mortimer
durand
paid
that
just
and
beautiful
tribute
abraham
lincoln
lincoln's
proclamation
which
not
only
set
the
black
slaves
free
but
set
the
white
man
free
also
the
owner
was
set
free
from
the
burden
and
offence
that
sad
condition
of
things
where
he
was
in
so
many
instances
a
master
and
owner
of
slaves
when
he
did
not
want
to
be
that
proclamation
set
them
all
free
but
even
in
this
matter
england
suggested
it
for
england
had
set
her
slaves
free
thirty
years
before
and
we
followed
her
example
we
always
followed
her
example
whether
it
was
good
or
bad
and
it
was
an
english
judge
that
issued
that
other
great
proclamation
and
established
that
great
principle
that
when
a
slave
let
him
belong
to
whom
he
may
and
let
him
come
whence
he
may
sets
his
foot
upon
english
soil
his
fetters
by
that
act
fall
away
and
he
is
a
free
man
before
the
world
we
followed
the
example
of
and
we
freed
our
slaves
as
i
have
said
it
is
true
then
that
all
our
fourths
of
july
and
we
have
five
of
them
england
gave
to
us
except
that
one
that
i
have
mentioned
the
emancipation
proclamation
and
lest
we
forget
let
us
all
remember
that
we
owe
these
things
to
england
let
us
be
able
to
say
to
old
england
this
great
hearted
venerable
old
mother
of
the
race
you
gave
us
our
fourths
of
july
that
we
love
and
that
we
honor
and
revere
you
gave
us
the
declaration
of
independence
which
is
the
charter
of
our
rights
you
the
venerable
mother
of
liberties
the
protector
of
anglo
saxon
freedom
you
gave
us
these
things
and
we
do
most
honestly
thank
you
for
them
americans
and
the
english
address
at
a
gathering
of
americans
in
london
july
mr
chairman
and
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
thank
you
for
the
compliment
which
has
just
been
tendered
me
and
to
show
my
appreciation
of
it
i
will
not
afflict
you
with
many
words
it
is
pleasant
to
celebrate
in
this
peaceful
way
upon
this
old
mother
soil
the
anniversary
of
an
experiment
which
was
born
of
war
with
this
same
land
so
long
ago
and
wrought
out
to
a
successful
issue
by
the
devotion
of
our
ancestors
it
has
taken
nearly
a
hundred
years
to
bring
the
english
and
americans
into
kindly
and
mutually
appreciative
relations
but
i
believe
it
has
been
accomplished
at
last
it
was
a
great
step
when
the
two
last
misunderstandings
were
settled
by
arbitration
instead
of
cannon
it
is
another
great
step
when
england
adopts
our
sewing
machines
without
claiming
the
invention
as
usual
it
was
another
when
they
imported
one
of
our
sleeping
cars
the
other
day
and
it
warmed
my
heart
more
than
i
can
tell
yesterday
when
i
witnessed
the
spectacle
of
an
englishman
ordering
an
american
sherry
cobbler
of
his
own
free
will
and
accord
and
not
only
that
but
with
a
great
brain
and
a
level
head
reminding
the
barkeeper
not
to
forget
the
strawberries
with
a
common
origin
a
common
language
a
common
literature
a
common
religion
and
common
drinks
what
is
longer
needful
to
the
cementing
of
the
two
nations
together
in
a
permanent
bond
of
brotherhood
this
is
an
age
of
progress
and
ours
is
a
progressive
land
a
great
and
glorious
land
too
a
land
which
has
developed
a
washington
a
franklin
a
wm
m
tweed
a
longfellow
a
motley
a
jay
gould
a
samuel
c
pomeroy
a
recent
congress
which
has
never
had
its
equal
in
some
respects
and
a
united
states
army
which
conquered
sixty
indians
in
eight
months
by
tiring
them
out
which
is
much
better
than
uncivilized
slaughter
god
knows
we
have
a
criminal
jury
system
which
is
superior
to
any
in
the
world
and
its
efficiency
is
only
marred
by
the
difficulty
of
finding
twelve
men
every
day
who
don't
know
anything
and
can't
read
and
i
may
observe
that
we
have
an
insanity
plea
that
would
have
saved
cain
i
think
i
can
say
and
say
with
pride
that
we
have
some
legislatures
that
bring
higher
prices
than
any
in
the
world
i
refer
with
effusion
to
our
railway
system
which
consents
to
let
us
live
though
it
might
do
the
opposite
being
our
owners
it
only
destroyed
three
thousand
and
seventy
lives
last
year
by
collisions
and
twenty
seven
thousand
two
hundred
and
sixty
by
running
over
heedless
and
unnecessary
people
at
crossings
the
companies
seriously
regretted
the
killing
of
these
thirty
thousand
people
and
went
so
far
as
to
pay
for
some
of
them
voluntarily
of
course
for
the
meanest
of
us
would
not
claim
that
we
possess
a
court
treacherous
enough
to
enforce
a
law
against
a
railway
company
but
thank
heaven
the
railway
companies
are
generally
disposed
to
do
the
right
and
kindly
thing
without
compulsion
i
know
of
an
instance
which
greatly
touched
me
at
the
time
after
an
accident
the
company
sent
home
the
remains
of
a
dear
distant
old
relative
of
mine
in
a
basket
with
the
remark
please
state
what
figure
you
hold
him
at
and
return
the
basket
now
there
couldn't
be
anything
friendlier
than
that
but
i
must
not
stand
here
and
brag
all
night
however
you
won't
mind
a
body
bragging
a
little
about
his
country
on
the
fourth
of
july
it
is
a
fair
and
legitimate
time
to
fly
the
eagle
i
will
say
only
one
more
word
of
brag
and
a
hopeful
one
it
is
this
we
have
a
form
of
government
which
gives
each
man
a
fair
chance
and
no
favor
with
us
no
individual
is
born
with
a
right
to
look
down
upon
his
neighbor
and
hold
him
in
contempt
let
such
of
us
as
are
not
dukes
find
our
consolation
in
that
and
we
may
find
hope
for
the
future
in
the
fact
that
as
unhappy
as
is
the
condition
of
our
political
morality
to
day
england
has
risen
up
out
of
a
far
fouler
since
the
days
when
charles
i
ennobled
courtesans
and
all
political
place
was
a
matter
of
bargain
and
sale
there
is
hope
for
us
yet
at
least
the
above
is
the
speech
which
i
was
going
to
make
but
our
minister
general
schenck
presided
and
after
the
blessing
got
up
and
made
a
great
long
inconceivably
dull
harangue
and
wound
up
by
saying
that
inasmuch
as
speech
making
did
not
seem
to
exhilarate
the
guests
much
all
further
oratory
would
be
dispensed
with
during
the
evening
and
we
could
just
sit
and
talk
privately
to
our
elbow
neighbors
and
have
a
good
sociable
time
it
is
known
that
in
consequence
of
that
remark
forty
four
perfected
speeches
died
in
the
womb
the
depression
the
gloom
the
solemnity
that
reigned
over
the
banquet
from
that
time
forth
will
be
a
lasting
memory
with
many
that
were
there
by
that
one
thoughtless
remark
general
schenck
lost
forty
four
of
the
best
friends
he
had
in
england
more
than
one
said
that
night
and
this
is
the
sort
of
person
that
is
sent
to
represent
us
in
a
great
sister
empire
about
london
address
at
a
dinner
given
by
the
savage
club
london
september
reported
by
moncure
d
conway
in
the
cincinnati
commercial
it
affords
me
sincere
pleasure
to
meet
this
distinguished
club
a
club
which
has
extended
its
hospitalities
and
its
cordial
welcome
to
so
many
of
my
countrymen
i
hope
here
the
speaker's
voice
became
low
and
you
will
excuse
these
clothes
i
am
going
to
the
theatre
that
will
explain
these
clothes
i
have
other
clothes
than
these
judging
human
nature
by
what
i
have
seen
of
it
i
suppose
that
the
customary
thing
for
a
stranger
to
do
when
he
stands
here
is
to
make
a
pun
on
the
name
of
this
club
under
the
impression
of
course
that
he
is
the
first
man
that
that
idea
has
occurred
to
it
is
a
credit
to
our
human
nature
not
a
blemish
upon
it
for
it
shows
that
underlying
all
our
depravity
and
god
knows
and
you
know
we
are
depraved
enough
and
all
our
sophistication
and
untarnished
by
them
there
is
a
sweet
germ
of
innocence
and
simplicity
still
when
a
stranger
says
to
me
with
a
glow
of
inspiration
in
his
eye
some
gentle
innocuous
little
thing
about
twain
and
one
flesh
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
don't
try
to
crush
that
man
into
the
earth
no
i
feel
like
saying
let
me
take
you
by
the
hand
sir
let
me
embrace
you
i
have
not
heard
that
pun
for
weeks
we
will
deal
in
palpable
puns
we
will
call
parties
named
king
your
majesty
and
we
will
say
to
the
smiths
that
we
think
we
have
heard
that
name
before
somewhere
such
is
human
nature
we
cannot
alter
this
it
is
god
that
made
us
so
for
some
good
and
wise
purpose
let
us
not
repine
but
though
i
may
seem
strange
may
seem
eccentric
i
mean
to
refrain
from
punning
upon
the
name
of
this
club
though
i
could
make
a
very
good
one
if
i
had
time
to
think
about
it
a
week
i
cannot
express
to
you
what
entire
enjoyment
i
find
in
this
first
visit
to
this
prodigious
metropolis
of
yours
its
wonders
seem
to
me
to
be
limitless
i
go
about
as
in
a
dream
as
in
a
realm
of
enchantment
where
many
things
are
rare
and
beautiful
and
all
things
are
strange
and
marvellous
hour
after
hour
i
stand
i
stand
spellbound
as
it
were
and
gaze
upon
the
statuary
in
leicester
square
square
being
a
horrible
chaos
with
the
relic
of
an
equestrian
statue
in
the
centre
the
king
being
headless
and
limbless
and
the
horse
in
little
better
condition
i
visit
the
mortuary
effigies
of
noble
old
henry
viii
and
judge
jeffreys
and
the
preserved
gorilla
and
try
to
make
up
my
mind
which
of
my
ancestors
i
admire
the
most
i
go
to
that
matchless
hyde
park
and
drive
all
around
it
and
then
i
start
to
enter
it
at
the
marble
arch
and
am
induced
to
change
my
mind
are
not
permitted
in
hyde
park
nothing
less
aristocratic
than
a
private
carriage
it
is
a
great
benefaction
is
hyde
park
there
in
his
hansom
cab
the
invalid
can
go
the
poor
sad
child
of
misfortune
and
insert
his
nose
between
the
railings
and
breathe
the
pure
health
giving
air
of
the
country
and
of
heaven
and
if
he
is
a
swell
invalid
who
isn't
obliged
to
depend
upon
parks
for
his
country
air
he
can
drive
inside
if
he
owns
his
vehicle
i
drive
round
and
round
hyde
park
and
the
more
i
see
of
the
edges
of
it
the
more
grateful
i
am
that
the
margin
is
extensive
and
i
have
been
to
the
zoological
gardens
what
a
wonderful
place
that
is
i
never
have
seen
such
a
curious
and
interesting
variety
of
wild
animals
in
any
garden
before
except
mabilie
i
never
believed
before
there
were
so
many
different
kinds
of
animals
in
the
world
as
you
can
find
there
and
i
don't
believe
it
yet
i
have
been
to
the
british
museum
i
would
advise
you
to
drop
in
there
some
time
when
you
have
nothing
to
do
for
five
minutes
if
you
have
never
been
there
it
seems
to
me
the
noblest
monument
that
this
nation
has
yet
erected
to
her
greatness
i
say
to
her
our
greatness
as
a
nation
true
she
has
built
other
monuments
and
stately
ones
as
well
but
these
she
has
uplifted
in
honor
of
two
or
three
colossal
demigods
who
have
stalked
across
the
world's
stage
destroying
tyrants
and
delivering
nations
and
whose
prodigies
will
still
live
in
the
memories
of
men
ages
after
their
monuments
shall
have
crumbled
to
dust
i
refer
to
the
wellington
and
nelson
monuments
and
the
albert
memorial
the
albert
memorial
is
the
finest
monument
in
the
world
and
celebrates
the
existence
of
as
commonplace
a
person
as
good
luck
ever
lifted
out
of
obscurity
the
library
at
the
british
museum
i
find
particularly
astounding
i
have
read
there
hours
together
and
hardly
made
an
impression
on
it
i
revere
that
library
it
is
the
author's
friend
i
don't
care
how
mean
a
book
is
it
always
takes
one
copy
copy
of
every
book
printed
in
great
britain
must
by
law
be
sent
to
the
british
museum
a
law
much
complained
of
by
publishers
and
then
every
day
that
author
goes
there
to
gaze
at
that
book
and
is
encouraged
to
go
on
in
the
good
work
and
what
a
touching
sight
it
is
of
a
saturday
afternoon
to
see
the
poor
careworn
clergymen
gathered
together
in
that
vast
reading
room
cabbaging
sermons
for
sunday
you
will
pardon
my
referring
to
these
things
everything
in
this
monster
city
interests
me
and
i
cannot
keep
from
talking
even
at
the
risk
of
being
instructive
people
here
seem
always
to
express
distances
by
parables
to
a
stranger
it
is
just
a
little
confusing
to
be
so
parabolic
so
to
speak
i
collar
a
citizen
and
i
think
i
am
going
to
get
some
valuable
information
out
of
him
i
ask
him
how
far
it
is
to
birmingham
and
he
says
it
is
twenty
one
shillings
and
sixpence
now
we
know
that
doesn't
help
a
man
who
is
trying
to
learn
i
find
myself
down
town
somewhere
and
i
want
to
get
some
sort
of
idea
where
i
am
being
usually
lost
when
alone
and
i
stop
a
citizen
and
say
how
far
is
it
to
charing
cross
shilling
fare
in
a
cab
and
off
he
goes
i
suppose
if
i
were
to
ask
a
londoner
how
far
it
is
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
he
would
try
to
express
it
in
coin
but
i
am
trespassing
upon
your
time
with
these
geological
statistics
and
historical
reflections
i
will
not
longer
keep
you
from
your
orgies
tis
a
real
pleasure
for
me
to
be
here
and
i
thank
you
for
it
the
name
of
the
savage
club
is
associated
in
my
mind
with
the
kindly
interest
and
the
friendly
offices
which
you
lavished
upon
an
old
friend
of
mine
who
came
among
you
a
stranger
and
you
opened
your
english
hearts
to
him
and
gave
him
welcome
and
a
home
artemus
ward
asking
that
you
will
join
me
i
give
you
his
memory
princeton
mr
clemens
spent
several
days
in
may
in
princeton
new
jersey
as
the
guest
of
lawrence
hutton
he
gave
a
reading
one
evening
before
a
large
audience
composed
of
university
students
and
professors
before
the
reading
mr
clemens
said
i
feel
exceedingly
surreptitious
in
coming
down
here
without
an
announcement
of
any
kind
i
do
not
want
to
see
any
advertisements
around
for
the
reason
that
i'm
not
a
lecturer
any
longer
i
reformed
long
ago
and
i
break
over
and
commit
this
sin
only
just
one
time
this
year
and
that
is
moderate
i
think
for
a
person
of
my
disposition
it
is
not
my
purpose
to
lecture
any
more
as
long
as
i
live
i
never
intend
to
stand
up
on
a
platform
any
more
unless
by
the
request
of
a
sheriff
or
something
like
that
the
st
louis
harbor
boat
mark
twain
the
countess
de
rochambeau
christened
the
st
louis
harbor
boat
mark
twain
in
honor
of
mr
clemens
june
just
before
the
luncheon
he
acted
as
pilot
lower
away
lead
boomed
out
the
voice
of
the
pilot
mark
twain
quarter
five
and
one
half
six
feet
replied
the
leadsman
below
you
are
all
dead
safe
as
long
as
i
have
the
wheel
but
this
is
my
last
time
at
the
wheel
at
the
luncheon
mr
clemens
made
a
short
address
first
of
all
no
second
of
all
i
wish
to
offer
my
thanks
for
the
honor
done
me
by
naming
this
last
rose
of
summer
of
the
mississippi
valley
for
me
this
boat
which
represents
a
perished
interest
which
i
fortified
long
ago
but
did
not
save
its
life
and
in
the
first
place
i
wish
to
thank
the
countess
de
rochambeau
for
the
honor
she
has
done
me
in
presiding
at
this
christening
i
believe
that
it
is
peculiarly
appropriate
that
i
should
be
allowed
the
privilege
of
joining
my
voice
with
the
general
voice
of
st
louis
and
missouri
in
welcoming
to
the
mississippi
valley
and
this
part
of
the
continent
these
illustrious
visitors
from
france
when
la
salle
came
down
this
river
a
century
and
a
quarter
ago
there
was
nothing
on
its
banks
but
savages
he
opened
up
this
great
river
and
by
his
simple
act
was
gathered
in
this
great
louisiana
territory
i
would
have
done
it
myself
for
half
the
money
seventieth
birthday
address
at
a
dinner
given
by
colonel
george
harvey
at
delmonico's
december
to
celebrate
the
seventieth
anniversary
of
mr
clemens
birth
mr
howells
introduced
mr
clemens
now
ladies
and
gentlemen
and
colonel
harvey
i
will
try
not
to
be
greedy
on
your
behalf
in
wishing
the
health
of
our
honored
and
in
view
of
his
great
age
our
revered
guest
i
will
not
say
oh
king
live
forever
but
oh
king
live
as
long
as
you
like
great
applause
and
waving
of
napkins
all
rise
and
drink
to
mark
twain
well
if
i
made
that
joke
it
is
the
best
one
i
ever
made
and
it
is
in
the
prettiest
language
too
i
never
can
get
quite
to
that
height
but
i
appreciate
that
joke
and
i
shall
remember
it
and
i
shall
use
it
when
occasion
requires
i
have
had
a
great
many
birthdays
in
my
time
i
remember
the
first
one
very
well
and
i
always
think
of
it
with
indignation
everything
was
so
crude
unaesthetic
primeval
nothing
like
this
at
all
no
proper
appreciative
preparation
made
nothing
really
ready
now
for
a
person
born
with
high
and
delicate
instincts
why
even
the
cradle
wasn't
whitewashed
nothing
ready
at
all
i
hadn't
any
hair
i
hadn't
any
teeth
i
hadn't
any
clothes
i
had
to
go
to
my
first
banquet
just
like
that
well
everybody
came
swarming
in
it
was
the
merest
little
bit
of
a
village
hardly
that
just
a
little
hamlet
in
the
backwoods
of
missouri
where
nothing
ever
happened
and
the
people
were
all
interested
and
they
all
came
they
looked
me
over
to
see
if
there
was
anything
fresh
in
my
line
why
nothing
ever
happened
in
that
village
i
why
i
was
the
only
thing
that
had
really
happened
there
for
months
and
months
and
months
and
although
i
say
it
myself
that
shouldn't
i
came
the
nearest
to
being
a
real
event
that
had
happened
in
that
village
in
more
than
two
years
well
those
people
came
they
came
with
that
curiosity
which
is
so
provincial
with
that
frankness
which
also
is
so
provincial
and
they
examined
me
all
around
and
gave
their
opinion
nobody
asked
them
and
i
shouldn't
have
minded
if
anybody
had
paid
me
a
compliment
but
nobody
did
their
opinions
were
all
just
green
with
prejudice
and
i
feel
those
opinions
to
this
day
well
i
stood
that
as
long
as
well
you
know
i
was
born
courteous
and
i
stood
it
to
the
limit
i
stood
it
an
hour
and
then
the
worm
turned
i
was
the
worm
it
was
my
turn
to
turn
and
i
turned
i
knew
very
well
the
strength
of
my
position
i
knew
that
i
was
the
only
spotlessly
pure
and
innocent
person
in
that
whole
town
and
i
came
out
and
said
so
and
they
could
not
say
a
word
it
was
so
true
they
blushed
they
were
embarrassed
well
that
was
the
first
after
dinner
speech
i
ever
made
i
think
it
was
after
dinner
it's
a
long
stretch
between
that
first
birthday
speech
and
this
one
that
was
my
cradle
song
and
this
is
my
swan
song
i
suppose
i
am
used
to
swan
songs
i
have
sung
them
several
times
this
is
my
seventieth
birthday
and
i
wonder
if
you
all
rise
to
the
size
of
that
proposition
realizing
all
the
significance
of
that
phrase
seventieth
birthday
the
seventieth
birthday
it
is
the
time
of
life
when
you
arrive
at
a
new
and
awful
dignity
when
you
may
throw
aside
the
decent
reserves
which
have
oppressed
you
for
a
generation
and
stand
unafraid
and
unabashed
upon
your
seven
terraced
summit
and
look
down
and
teach
unrebuked
you
can
tell
the
world
how
you
got
there
it
is
what
they
all
do
you
shall
never
get
tired
of
telling
by
what
delicate
arts
and
deep
moralities
you
climbed
up
to
that
great
place
you
will
explain
the
process
and
dwell
on
the
particulars
with
senile
rapture
i
have
been
anxious
to
explain
my
own
system
this
long
time
and
now
at
last
i
have
the
right
i
have
achieved
my
seventy
years
in
the
usual
way
by
sticking
strictly
to
a
scheme
of
life
which
would
kill
anybody
else
it
sounds
like
an
exaggeration
but
that
is
really
the
common
rule
for
attaining
to
old
age
when
we
examine
the
programme
of
any
of
these
garrulous
old
people
we
always
find
that
the
habits
which
have
preserved
them
would
have
decayed
us
that
the
way
of
life
which
enabled
them
to
live
upon
the
property
of
their
heirs
so
long
as
mr
choate
says
would
have
put
us
out
of
commission
ahead
of
time
i
will
offer
here
as
a
sound
maxim
this
that
we
can't
reach
old
age
by
another
man's
road
i
will
now
teach
offering
my
way
of
life
to
whomsoever
desires
to
commit
suicide
by
the
scheme
which
has
enabled
me
to
beat
the
doctor
and
the
hangman
for
seventy
years
some
of
the
details
may
sound
untrue
but
they
are
not
i
am
not
here
to
deceive
i
am
here
to
teach
we
have
no
permanent
habits
until
we
are
forty
then
they
begin
to
harden
presently
they
petrify
then
business
begins
since
forty
i
have
been
regular
about
going
to
bed
and
getting
up
and
that
is
one
of
the
main
things
i
have
made
it
a
rule
to
go
to
bed
when
there
wasn't
anybody
left
to
sit
up
with
and
i
have
made
it
a
rule
to
get
up
when
i
had
to
this
has
resulted
in
an
unswerving
regularity
of
irregularity
it
has
saved
me
sound
but
it
would
injure
another
person
in
the
matter
of
diet
which
is
another
main
thing
i
have
been
persistently
strict
in
sticking
to
the
things
which
didn't
agree
with
me
until
one
or
the
other
of
us
got
the
best
of
it
until
lately
i
got
the
best
of
it
myself
but
last
spring
i
stopped
frolicking
with
mince
pie
after
midnight
up
to
then
i
had
always
believed
it
wasn't
loaded
for
thirty
years
i
have
taken
coffee
and
bread
at
eight
in
the
morning
and
no
bite
nor
sup
until
seven
thirty
in
the
evening
eleven
hours
that
is
all
right
for
me
and
is
wholesome
because
i
have
never
had
a
headache
in
my
life
but
headachy
people
would
not
reach
seventy
comfortably
by
that
road
and
they
would
be
foolish
to
try
it
and
i
wish
to
urge
upon
you
this
which
i
think
is
wisdom
that
if
you
find
you
can't
make
seventy
by
any
but
an
uncomfortable
road
don't
you
go
when
they
take
off
the
pullman
and
retire
you
to
the
rancid
smoker
put
on
your
things
count
your
checks
and
get
out
at
the
first
way
station
where
there's
a
cemetery
i
have
made
it
a
rule
never
to
smoke
more
than
one
cigar
at
a
time
i
have
no
other
restriction
as
regards
smoking
i
do
not
know
just
when
i
began
to
smoke
i
only
know
that
it
was
in
my
father's
lifetime
and
that
i
was
discreet
he
passed
from
this
life
early
in
when
i
was
a
shade
past
eleven
ever
since
then
i
have
smoked
publicly
as
an
example
to
others
and
not
that
i
care
for
moderation
myself
it
has
always
been
my
rule
never
to
smoke
when
asleep
and
never
to
refrain
when
awake
it
is
a
good
rule
i
mean
for
me
but
some
of
you
know
quite
well
that
it
wouldn't
answer
for
everybody
that's
trying
to
get
to
be
seventy
i
smoke
in
bed
until
i
have
to
go
to
sleep
i
wake
up
in
the
night
sometimes
once
sometimes
twice
sometimes
three
times
and
i
never
waste
any
of
these
opportunities
to
smoke
this
habit
is
so
old
and
dear
and
precious
to
me
that
i
would
feel
as
you
sir
would
feel
if
you
should
lose
the
only
moral
you've
got
meaning
the
chairman
if
you've
got
one
i
am
making
no
charges
i
will
grant
here
that
i
have
stopped
smoking
now
and
then
for
a
few
months
at
a
time
but
it
was
not
on
principle
it
was
only
to
show
off
it
was
to
pulverize
those
critics
who
said
i
was
a
slave
to
my
habits
and
couldn't
break
my
bonds
to
day
it
is
all
of
sixty
years
since
i
began
to
smoke
the
limit
i
have
never
bought
cigars
with
life
belts
around
them
i
early
found
that
those
were
too
expensive
for
me
i
have
always
bought
cheap
cigars
reasonably
cheap
at
any
rate
sixty
years
ago
they
cost
me
four
dollars
a
barrel
but
my
taste
has
improved
latterly
and
i
pay
seven
now
six
or
seven
seven
i
think
yes
it's
seven
but
that
includes
the
barrel
i
often
have
smoking
parties
at
my
house
but
the
people
that
come
have
always
just
taken
the
pledge
i
wonder
why
that
is
as
for
drinking
i
have
no
rule
about
that
when
the
others
drink
i
like
to
help
otherwise
i
remain
dry
by
habit
and
preference
this
dryness
does
not
hurt
me
but
it
could
easily
hurt
you
because
you
are
different
you
let
it
alone
since
i
was
seven
years
old
i
have
seldom
taken
a
dose
of
medicine
and
have
still
seldomer
needed
one
but
up
to
seven
i
lived
exclusively
on
allopathic
medicines
not
that
i
needed
them
for
i
don't
think
i
did
it
was
for
economy
my
father
took
a
drug
store
for
a
debt
and
it
made
cod
liver
oil
cheaper
than
the
other
breakfast
foods
we
had
nine
barrels
of
it
and
it
lasted
me
seven
years
then
i
was
weaned
the
rest
of
the
family
had
to
get
along
with
rhubarb
and
ipecac
and
such
things
because
i
was
the
pet
i
was
the
first
standard
oil
trust
i
had
it
all
by
the
time
the
drugstore
was
exhausted
my
health
was
established
and
there
has
never
been
much
the
matter
with
me
since
but
you
know
very
well
it
would
be
foolish
for
the
average
child
to
start
for
seventy
on
that
basis
it
happened
to
be
just
the
thing
for
me
but
that
was
merely
an
accident
it
couldn't
happen
again
in
a
century
i
have
never
taken
any
exercise
except
sleeping
and
resting
and
i
never
intend
to
take
any
exercise
is
loathsome
and
it
cannot
be
any
benefit
when
you
are
tired
and
i
was
always
tired
but
let
another
person
try
my
way
and
see
where
he
will
come
out
i
desire
now
to
repeat
and
emphasise
that
maxim
we
can't
reach
old
age
by
another
man's
road
my
habits
protect
my
life
but
they
would
assassinate
you
i
have
lived
a
severely
moral
life
but
it
would
be
a
mistake
for
other
people
to
try
that
or
for
me
to
recommend
it
very
few
would
succeed
you
have
to
have
a
perfectly
colossal
stock
of
morals
and
you
can't
get
them
on
a
margin
you
have
to
have
the
whole
thing
and
put
them
in
your
box
morals
are
an
acquirement
like
music
like
a
foreign
language
like
piety
poker
paralysis
no
man
is
born
with
them
i
wasn't
myself
i
started
poor
i
hadn't
a
single
moral
there
is
hardly
a
man
in
this
house
that
is
poorer
than
i
was
then
yes
i
started
like
that
the
world
before
me
not
a
moral
in
the
slot
not
even
an
insurance
moral
i
can
remember
the
first
one
i
ever
got
i
can
remember
the
landscape
the
weather
the
i
can
remember
how
everything
looked
it
was
an
old
moral
an
old
second
hand
moral
all
out
of
repair
and
didn't
fit
anyway
but
if
you
are
careful
with
a
thing
like
that
and
keep
it
in
a
dry
place
and
save
it
for
processions
and
chautauquas
and
world's
fairs
and
so
on
and
disinfect
it
now
and
then
and
give
it
a
fresh
coat
of
whitewash
once
in
a
while
you
will
be
surprised
to
see
how
well
she
will
last
and
how
long
she
will
keep
sweet
or
at
least
inoffensive
when
i
got
that
mouldy
old
moral
she
had
stopped
growing
because
she
hadn't
any
exercise
but
i
worked
her
hard
i
worked
her
sundays
and
all
under
this
cultivation
she
waxed
in
might
and
stature
beyond
belief
and
served
me
well
and
was
my
pride
and
joy
for
sixty
three
years
then
she
got
to
associating
with
insurance
presidents
and
lost
flesh
and
character
and
was
a
sorrow
to
look
at
and
no
longer
competent
for
business
she
was
a
great
loss
to
me
yet
not
all
loss
i
sold
her
ah
pathetic
skeleton
as
she
was
i
sold
her
to
leopold
the
pirate
king
of
belgium
he
sold
her
to
our
metropolitan
museum
and
it
was
very
glad
to
get
her
for
without
a
rag
on
she
stands
feet
long
and
feet
high
and
they
think
she's
a
brontosaur
well
she
looks
it
they
believe
it
will
take
nineteen
geological
periods
to
breed
her
match
morals
are
of
inestimable
value
for
every
man
is
born
crammed
with
sin
microbes
and
the
only
thing
that
can
extirpate
these
sin
microbes
is
morals
now
you
take
a
sterilized
christian
i
mean
you
take
the
sterilized
christian
for
there's
only
one
dear
sir
i
wish
you
wouldn't
look
at
me
like
that
threescore
years
and
ten
it
is
the
scriptural
statute
of
limitations
after
that
you
owe
no
active
duties
for
you
the
strenuous
life
is
over
you
are
a
time
expired
man
to
use
kipling's
military
phrase
you
have
served
your
term
well
or
less
well
and
you
are
mustered
out
you
are
become
an
honorary
member
of
the
republic
you
are
emancipated
compulsions
are
not
for
you
nor
any
bugle
call
but
lights
out
you
pay
the
time
worn
duty
bills
if
you
choose
or
decline
if
you
prefer
and
without
prejudice
for
they
are
not
legally
collectable
the
previous
engagement
plea
which
in
forty
years
has
cost
you
so
many
twinges
you
can
lay
aside
forever
on
this
side
of
the
grave
you
will
never
need
it
again
if
you
shrink
at
thought
of
night
and
winter
and
the
late
home
coming
from
the
banquet
and
the
lights
and
the
laughter
through
the
deserted
streets
a
desolation
which
would
not
remind
you
now
as
for
a
generation
it
did
that
your
friends
are
sleeping
and
you
must
creep
in
a
tiptoe
and
not
disturb
them
but
would
only
remind
you
that
you
need
not
tiptoe
you
can
never
disturb
them
more
if
you
shrink
at
thought
of
these
things
you
need
only
reply
your
invitation
honors
me
and
pleases
me
because
you
still
keep
me
in
your
remembrance
but
i
am
seventy
seventy
and
would
nestle
in
the
chimney
corner
and
smoke
my
pipe
and
read
my
book
and
take
my
rest
wishing
you
well
in
all
affection
and
that
when
you
in
your
return
shall
arrive
at
pier
no
you
may
step
aboard
your
waiting
ship
with
a
reconciled
spirit
and
lay
your
course
toward
the
sinking
sun
with
a
contented
heart
the
body
of
the
nation
but
the
basin
of
the
mississippi
is
the
body
of
the
nation
all
the
other
parts
are
but
members
important
in
themselves
yet
more
important
in
their
relations
to
this
exclusive
of
the
lake
basin
and
of
square
miles
in
texas
and
new
mexico
which
in
many
aspects
form
a
part
of
it
this
basin
contains
about
square
miles
in
extent
it
is
the
second
great
valley
of
the
world
being
exceeded
only
by
that
of
the
amazon
the
valley
of
the
frozen

approaches
it
in
extent
that
of
la
plata
comes
next
in
space
and
probably
in
habitable
capacity
having
about
eight
ninths

times
the

or

ten
times
conceptions
formed
from
the
river
basins
of
western
europe
are
rudely
shocked
when
we
consider
the
extent
of
the
valley
of
the
mississippi
nor
are
those
formed
from
the
sterile
basins
of
the
great
rivers
of
siberia
the
lofty
plateaus
of
central
asia
or
the
mighty
sweep
of
the
swampy
amazon
more
adequate
latitude
elevation
and
rainfall
all
combine
to
render
every
part
of
the
mississippi
valley
capable
of
supporting
a
dense
population
as
a
dwelling
place
for
civilized
man
it
is
by
far
the
first
upon
our
globe
editor's
table
harper's
magazine
february
chapter
the
river
and
its
history
the
mississippi
is
well
worth
reading
about
it
is
not
a
commonplace
river
but
on
the
contrary
is
in
all
ways
remarkable
considering
the
missouri
its
main
branch
it
is
the
longest
river
in
the
world
four
thousand
three
hundred
miles
it
seems
safe
to
say
that
it
is
also
the
crookedest
river
in
the
world
since
in
one
part
of
its
journey
it
uses
up
one
thousand
three
hundred
miles
to
cover
the
same
ground
that
the
crow
would
fly
over
in
six
hundred
and
seventy
five
it
discharges
three
times
as
much
water
as
the
st
lawrence
twenty
five
times
as
much
as
the
rhine
and
three
hundred
and
thirty
eight
times
as
much
as
the
thames
no
other
river
has
so
vast
a
drainage
basin
it
draws
its
water
supply
from
twenty
eight
states
and
territories
from
delaware
on
the
atlantic
seaboard
and
from
all
the
country
between
that
and
idaho
on
the
pacific
slope
a
spread
of
forty
five
degrees
of
longitude
the
mississippi
receives
and
carries
to
the
gulf
water
from
fifty
four
subordinate
rivers
that
are
navigable
by
steamboats
and
from
some
hundreds
that
are
navigable
by
flats
and
keels
the
area
of
its
drainage
basin
is
as
great
as
the
combined
areas
of
england
wales
scotland
ireland
france
spain
portugal
germany
austria
italy
and
turkey
and
almost
all
this
wide
region
is
fertile
the
mississippi
valley
proper
is
exceptionally
so
it
is
a
remarkable
river
in
this
that
instead
of
widening
toward
its
mouth
it
grows
narrower
grows
narrower
and
deeper
from
the
junction
of
the
ohio
to
a
point
half
way
down
to
the
sea
the
width
averages
a
mile
in
high
water
thence
to
the
sea
the
width
steadily
diminishes
until
at
the
passes
above
the
mouth
it
is
but
little
over
half
a
mile
at
the
junction
of
the
ohio
the
mississippi's
depth
is
eighty
seven
feet
the
depth
increases
gradually
reaching
one
hundred
and
twenty
nine
just
above
the
mouth
the
difference
in
rise
and
fall
is
also
remarkable
not
in
the
upper
but
in
the
lower
river
the
rise
is
tolerably
uniform
down
to
natchez
three
hundred
and
sixty
miles
above
the
mouth
about
fifty
feet
but
at
bayou
la
fourche
the
river
rises
only
twenty
four
feet

only
fifteen

just
above

mouth
only
two
and
one
half
an
article
in
the
new
orleans
times
democrat
based
upon
reports
of
able
engineers
states
that
the
river
annually
empties
four
hundred
and
six
million
tons
of
mud
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
which
brings
to
mind
captain
marryat's
rude
name
for
the
mississippi
the
great
sewer
this
mud
solidified
would
make
a
mass
a
mile
square
and
two
hundred
and
forty
one
feet
high
the
mud
deposit
gradually
extends
the
land
but
only
gradually
it
has
extended
it
not
quite
a
third
of
a
mile
in
the
two
hundred
years
which
have
elapsed
since
the
river
took
its
place
in
history
the
belief
of
the
scientific
people
is
that
the
mouth
used
to
be
at
baton
rouge
where
the
hills
cease
and
that
the
two
hundred
miles
of
land
between
there
and
the
gulf
was
built
by
the
river
this
gives
us
the
age
of
that
piece
of
country
without
any
trouble
at
all
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
years
yet
it
is
much
the
youthfullest
batch
of
country
that
lies
around
there
anywhere
the
mississippi
is
remarkable
in
still
another
way
its
disposition
to
make
prodigious
jumps
by
cutting
through
narrow
necks
of
land
and
thus
straightening
and
shortening
itself
more
than
once
it
has
shortened
itself
thirty
miles
at
a
single
jump
these
cut
offs
have
had
curious
effects
they
have
thrown
several
river
towns
out
into
the
rural
districts
and
built
up
sand
bars
and
forests
in
front
of
them
the
town
of
delta
used
to
be
three
miles
below
vicksburg
a
recent
cutoff
has
radically
changed
the
position
and
delta
is
now
two
miles
above
vicksburg
both
of
these
river
towns
have
been
retired
to
the
country
by
that
cut
off
a
cut
off
plays
havoc
with
boundary
lines
and
jurisdictions
for
instance
a
man
is
living
in
the
state
of
mississippi
to
day
a
cut
off
occurs
to
night
and
to
morrow
the
man
finds
himself
and
his
land
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
within
the
boundaries
and
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
state
of
louisiana
such
a
thing
happening
in
the
upper
river
in
the
old
times
could
have
transferred
a
slave
from
missouri
to
illinois
and
made
a
free
man
of
him
the
mississippi
does
not
alter
its
locality
by
cut
offs
alone
it
is
always
changing
its
habitat
bodily
is
always
moving
bodily
sidewise
at
hard
times
la
the
river
is
two
miles
west
of
the
region
it
used
to
occupy
as
a
result
the
original
site
of
that
settlement
is
not
now
in
louisiana
at
all
but
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
in
the
state
of
mississippi
nearly
the
whole
of
that
one
thousand
three
hundred
miles
of
old
mississippi
river
which
la
salle
floated
down
in
his
canoes
two
hundred
years
ago
is
good
solid
dry
ground
now
the
river
lies
to
the
right
of
it
in
places
and
to
the
left
of
it
in
other
places
although
the
mississippi's
mud
builds
land
but
slowly
down
at
the
mouth
where
the
gulfs
billows
interfere
with
its
work
it
builds
fast
enough
in
better
protected
regions
higher
up
for
instance
prophet's
island
contained
one
thousand
five
hundred
acres
of
land
thirty
years
ago
since
then
the
river
has
added
seven
hundred
acres
to
it
but
enough
of
these
examples
of
the
mighty
stream's
eccentricities
for
the
present
i
will
give
a
few
more
of
them
further
along
in
the
book
let
us
drop
the
mississippi's
physical
history
and
say
a
word
about
its
historical
history
so
to
speak
we
can
glance
briefly
at
its
slumbrous
first
epoch
in
a
couple
of
short
chapters
at
its
second
and
wider
awake
epoch
in
a
couple
more
at
its
flushest
and
widest
awake
epoch
in
a
good
many
succeeding
chapters
and
then
talk
about
its
comparatively
tranquil
present
epoch
in
what
shall
be
left
of
the
book
the
world
and
the
books
are
so
accustomed
to
use
and
over
use
the
word
new
in
connection
with
our
country
that
we
early
get
and
permanently
retain
the
impression
that
there
is
nothing
old
about
it
we
do
of
course
know
that
there
are
several
comparatively
old
dates
in
american
history
but
the
mere
figures
convey
to
our
minds
no
just
idea
no
distinct
realization
of
the
stretch
of
time
which
they
represent
to
say
that
de
soto
the
first
white
man
who
ever
saw
the
mississippi
river
saw
it
in
is
a
remark
which
states
a
fact
without
interpreting
it
it
is
something
like
giving
the
dimensions
of
a
sunset
by
astronomical
measurements
and
cataloguing
the
colors
by
their
scientific
names
as
a
result
you
get
the
bald
fact
of
the
sunset
but
you
don't
see
the
sunset
it
would
have
been
better
to
paint
a
picture
of
it
the
date
standing
by
itself
means
little
or
nothing
to
us
but
when
one
groups
a
few
neighboring
historical
dates
and
facts
around
it
he
adds
perspective
and
color
and
then
realizes
that
this
is
one
of
the
american
dates
which
is
quite
respectable
for
age
for
instance
when
the
mississippi
was
first
seen
by
a
white
man
less
than
a
quarter
of
a

had
elapsed

was
getting

and

effectively
started
when
de

stood
on

it
was

before

unquestionably
the
discovery
of
the
mississippi
is
a
datable
fact
which
considerably
mellows
and
modifies
the
shiny
newness
of
our
country
and
gives
her
a
most
respectable
outside
aspect
of
rustiness
and
antiquity
de
soto
merely
glimpsed
the
river
then
died
and
was
buried
in
it
by
his
priests
and
soldiers
one
would
expect
the
priests
and
the
soldiers
to
multiply
the
river's
dimensions
by
ten
the
spanish
custom
of
the
day
and
thus
move
other
adventurers
to
go
at
once
and
explore
it
on
the
contrary
their
narratives
when
they
reached
home
did
not
excite
that
amount
of
curiosity
the
mississippi
was
left
unvisited
by
whites
during
a
term
of
years
which
seems
incredible
in
our
energetic
days
one
may
sense
the
interval
to
his
mind
after
a
fashion
by
dividing
it
up
in
this
way
after
de
soto
glimpsed
the
river
a
fraction
short
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
elapsed
and
then
shakespeare
was
born
lived
a
trifle
more
than
half
a
century
then
died
and
when
he
had
been
in
his
grave
considerably
more
than
half
a
century
the
second
white
man
saw
the
mississippi
in
our
day
we
don't
allow
a
hundred
and
thirty
years
to
elapse
between
glimpses
of
a
marvel
if
somebody
should
discover
a
creek
in
the
county
next
to
the
one
that
the
north
pole
is
in
europe
and
america
would
start
fifteen
costly
expeditions
thither
one
to
explore
the
creek
and
the
other
fourteen
to
hunt
for
each
other
for
more
than
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
there
had
been
white
settlements
on
our
atlantic
coasts
these
people
were
in
intimate
communication
with
the
indians
in
the
south
the
spaniards
were
robbing
slaughtering
enslaving
and
converting
them
higher
up
the
english
were
trading
beads
and
blankets
to
them
for
a
consideration
and
throwing
in
civilization
and
whiskey
for
lagniappe
and
in
canada
the
french
were
schooling
them
in
a
rudimentary
way
missionarying
among
them
and
drawing
whole
populations
of
them
at
a
time
to
quebec
and
later
to
montreal
to
buy
furs
of
them
necessarily
then
these
various
clusters
of
whites
must
have
heard
of
the
great
river
of
the
far
west
and
indeed
they
did
hear
of
it
vaguely
so
vaguely
and
indefinitely
that
its
course
proportions
and
locality
were
hardly
even
guessable
the
mere
mysteriousness
of
the
matter
ought
to
have
fired
curiosity
and
compelled
exploration
but
this
did
not
occur
apparently
nobody
happened
to
want
such
a
river
nobody
needed
it
nobody
was
curious
about
it
so
for
a
century
and
a
half
the
mississippi
remained
out
of
the
market
and
undisturbed
when
de
soto
found
it
he
was
not
hunting
for
a
river
and
had
no
present
occasion
for
one
consequently
he
did
not
value
it
or
even
take
any
particular
notice
of
it
but
at
last
la
salle
the
frenchman
conceived
the
idea
of
seeking
out
that
river
and
exploring
it
it
always
happens
that
when
a
man
seizes
upon
a
neglected
and
important
idea
people
inflamed
with
the
same
notion
crop
up
all
around
it
happened
so
in
this
instance
naturally
the
question
suggests
itself
why
did
these
people
want
the
river
now
when
nobody
had
wanted
it
in
the
five
preceding
generations
apparently
it
was
because
at
this
late
day
they
thought
they
had
discovered
a
way
to
make
it
useful
for
it
had
come
to
be
believed
that
the
mississippi
emptied
into
the
gulf
of
california
and
therefore
afforded
a
short
cut
from
canada
to
china
previously
the
supposition
had
been
that
it
emptied
into
the
atlantic
or
sea
of
virginia
chapter
the
river
and
its
explorers
la
salle
himself
sued
for
certain
high
privileges
and
they
were
graciously
accorded
him
by
louis
xiv
of
inflated
memory
chief
among
them
was
the
privilege
to
explore
far
and
wide
and
build
forts
and
stake
out
continents
and
hand
the
same
over
to
the
king
and
pay
the
expenses
himself
receiving
in
return
some
little
advantages
of
one
sort
or
another
among
them
the
monopoly
of
buffalo
hides
he
spent
several
years
and
about
all
of
his
money
in
making
perilous
and
painful
trips
between
montreal
and
a
fort
which
he
had
built
on
the
illinois
before
he
at
last
succeeded
in
getting
his
expedition
in
such
a
shape
that
he
could
strike
for
the
mississippi
and
meantime
other
parties
had
had
better
fortune
in
joliet
the
merchant
and
marquette
the
priest
crossed
the
country
and
reached
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
they
went
by
way
of
the
great
lakes
and
from
green
bay
in
canoes
by
way
of
fox
river
and
the
wisconsin
marquette
had
solemnly
contracted
on
the
feast
of
the
immaculate
conception
that
if
the
virgin
would
permit
him
to
discover
the
great
river
he
would
name
it
conception
in
her
honor
he
kept
his
word
in
that
day
all
explorers
traveled
with
an
outfit
of
priests
de
soto
had
twenty
four
with
him
la
salle
had
several
also
the
expeditions
were
often
out
of
meat
and
scant
of
clothes
but
they
always
had
the
furniture
and
other
requisites
for
the
mass
they
were
always
prepared
as
one
of
the
quaint
chroniclers
of
the
time
phrased
it
to
explain
hell
to
the
savages
on
the
of
june
the
canoes
of
joliet
and
marquette
and
their
five
subordinates
reached
the
junction
of
the
wisconsin
with
the
mississippi
mr
parkman
says
before
them
a
wide
and
rapid
current
coursed
athwart
their
way
by
the
foot
of
lofty
heights
wrapped
thick
in
forests
he
continues
turning
southward
they
paddled
down
the
stream
through
a
solitude
unrelieved
by
the
faintest
trace
of
man
a
big
cat
fish
collided
with
marquette's
canoe
and
startled
him
and
reasonably
enough
for
he
had
been
warned
by
the
indians
that
he
was
on
a
foolhardy
journey
and
even
a
fatal
one
for
the
river
contained
a
demon
whose
roar
could
be
heard
at
a
great
distance
and
who
would
engulf
them
in
the
abyss
where
he
dwelt
i
have
seen
a
mississippi
cat
fish
that
was
more
than
six
feet
long
and
weighed
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
if
marquette's
fish
was
the
fellow
to
that
one
he
had
a
fair
right
to
think
the
river's
roaring
demon
was
come
at
length
the
buffalo
began
to
appear
grazing
in
herds
on
the
great
prairies
which
then
bordered
the
river
and
marquette
describes
the
fierce
and
stupid
look
of
the
old
bulls
as
they
stared
at
the
intruders
through
the
tangled
mane
which
nearly
blinded
them
the
voyagers
moved
cautiously
landed
at
night
and
made
a
fire
to
cook
their
evening
meal
then
extinguished
it
embarked
again
paddled
some
way
farther
and
anchored
in
the
stream
keeping
a
man
on
the
watch
till
morning
they
did
this
day
after
day
and
night
after
night
and
at
the
end
of
two
weeks
they
had
not
seen
a
human
being
the
river
was
an
awful
solitude
then
and
it
is
now
over
most
of
its
stretch
but
at
the
close
of
the
fortnight
they
one
day
came
upon
the
footprints
of
men
in
the
mud
of
the
western
bank
a
robinson
crusoe
experience
which
carries
an
electric
shiver
with
it
yet
when
one
stumbles
on
it
in
print
they
had
been
warned
that
the
river
indians
were
as
ferocious
and
pitiless
as
the
river
demon
and
destroyed
all
comers
without
waiting
for
provocation
but
no
matter
joliet
and
marquette
struck
into
the
country
to
hunt
up
the
proprietors
of
the
tracks
they
found
them
by
and
by
and
were
hospitably
received
and
well
treated
if
to
be
received
by
an
indian
chief
who
has
taken
off
his
last
rag
in
order
to
appear
at
his
level
best
is
to
be
received
hospitably
and
if
to
be
treated
abundantly
to
fish
porridge
and
other
game
including
dog
and
have
these
things
forked
into
one's
mouth
by
the
ungloved
fingers
of
indians
is
to
be
well
treated
in
the
morning
the
chief
and
six
hundred
of
his
tribesmen
escorted
the
frenchmen
to
the
river
and
bade
them
a
friendly
farewell
on
the
rocks
above
the
present
city
of
alton
they
found
some
rude
and
fantastic
indian
paintings
which
they
describe
a
short
distance
below
a
torrent
of
yellow
mud
rushed
furiously
athwart
the
calm
blue
current
of
the
mississippi
boiling
and
surging
and
sweeping
in
its
course
logs
branches
and
uprooted
trees
this
was
the
mouth
of
the
missouri
that
savage
river
which
descending
from
its
mad
career
through
a
vast
unknown
of
barbarism
poured
its
turbid
floods
into
the
bosom
of
its
gentle
sister
by
and
by
they
passed
the
mouth
of
the
ohio
they
passed
cane
brakes
they
fought
mosquitoes
they
floated
along
day
after
day
through
the
deep
silence
and
loneliness
of
the
river
drowsing
in
the
scant
shade
of
makeshift
awnings
and
broiling
with
the
heat
they
encountered
and
exchanged
civilities
with
another
party
of
indians
and
at
last
they
reached
the
mouth
of
the
arkansas
about
a
month
out
from
their
starting
point
where
a
tribe
of
war
whooping
savages
swarmed
out
to
meet
and
murder
them
but
they
appealed
to
the
virgin
for
help
so
in
place
of
a
fight
there
was
a
feast
and
plenty
of
pleasant
palaver
and
fol
de
rol
they
had
proved
to
their
satisfaction
that
the
mississippi
did
not
empty
into
the
gulf
of
california
or
into
the
atlantic
they
believed
it
emptied
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
they
turned
back
now
and
carried
their
great
news
to
canada
but
belief
is
not
proof
it
was
reserved
for
la
salle
to
furnish
the
proof
he
was
provokingly
delayed
by
one
misfortune
after
another
but
at
last
got
his
expedition
under
way
at
the
end
of
the
year
in
the
dead
of
winter
he
and
henri
de
tonty
son
of
lorenzo
tonty
who
invented
the
tontine
his
lieutenant
started
down
the
illinois
with
a
following
of
eighteen
indians
brought
from
new
england
and
twenty
three
frenchmen
they
moved
in
procession
down
the
surface
of
the
frozen
river
on
foot
and
dragging
their
canoes
after
them
on
sledges
at
peoria
lake
they
struck
open
water
and
paddled
thence
to
the
mississippi
and
turned
their
prows
southward
they
plowed
through
the
fields
of
floating
ice
past
the
mouth
of
the
missouri
past
the
mouth
of
the
ohio
by
and
by
and
gliding
by
the
wastes
of
bordering
swamp
landed
on
the
of
february
near
the
third
chickasaw
bluffs
where
they
halted
and
built
fort
prudhomme
again
says
mr
parkman
they
embarked
and
with
every
stage
of
their
adventurous
progress
the
mystery
of
this
vast
new
world
was
more
and
more
unveiled
more
and
more
they
entered
the
realms
of
spring
the
hazy
sunlight
the
warm
and
drowsy
air
the
tender
foliage
the
opening
flowers
betokened
the
reviving
life
of
nature
day
by
day
they
floated
down
the
great
bends
in
the
shadow
of
the
dense
forests
and
in
time
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
arkansas
first
they
were
greeted
by
the
natives
of
this
locality
as
marquette
had
before
been
greeted
by
them
with
the
booming
of
the
war
drum
and
the
flourish
of
arms
the
virgin
composed
the
difficulty
in
marquette's
case
the
pipe
of
peace
did
the
same
office
for
la
salle
the
white
man
and
the
red
man
struck
hands
and
entertained
each
other
during
three
days
then
to
the
admiration
of
the
savages
la
salle
set
up
a
cross
with
the
arms
of
france
on
it
and
took
possession
of
the
whole
country
for
the
king
the
cool
fashion
of
the
time
while
the
priest
piously
consecrated
the
robbery
with
a
hymn
the
priest
explained
the
mysteries
of
the
faith
by
signs
for
the
saving
of
the
savages
thus
compensating
them
with
possible
possessions
in
heaven
for
the
certain
ones
on
earth
which
they
had
just
been
robbed
of
and
also
by
signs
la
salle
drew
from
these
simple
children
of
the
forest
acknowledgments
of
fealty
to
louis
the
putrid
over
the
water
nobody
smiled
at
these
colossal
ironies
these
performances
took
place
on
the
site
of
the
future
town
of
napoleon
arkansas
and
there
the
first
confiscation
cross
was
raised
on
the
banks
of
the
great
river
marquette's
and
joliet's
voyage
of
discovery
ended
at
the
same
spot
the
site
of
the
future
town
of
napoleon
when
de
soto
took
his
fleeting
glimpse
of
the
river
away
back
in
the
dim
early
days
he
took
it
from
that
same
spot
the
site
of
the
future
town
of
napoleon
arkansas
therefore
three
out
of
the
four
memorable
events
connected
with
the
discovery
and
exploration
of
the
mighty
river
occurred
by
accident
in
one
and
the
same
place
it
is
a
most
curious
distinction
when
one
comes
to
look
at
it
and
think
about
it
france
stole
that
vast
country
on
that
spot
the
future
napoleon
and
by
and
by
napoleon
himself
was
to
give
the
country
back
again
make
restitution
not
to
the
owners
but
to
their
white
american
heirs
the
voyagers
journeyed
on
touching
here
and
there
passed
the
sites
since
become
historic
of
vicksburg
and
grand
gulf
and
visited
an
imposing
indian
monarch
in
the
teche
country
whose
capital
city
was
a
substantial
one
of
sun
baked
bricks
mixed
with
straw
better
houses
than
many
that
exist
there
now
the
chiefs
house
contained
an
audience
room
forty
feet
square
and
there
he
received
tonty
in
state
surrounded
by
sixty
old
men
clothed
in
white
cloaks
there
was
a
temple
in
the
town
with
a
mud
wall
about
it
ornamented
with
skulls
of
enemies
sacrificed
to
the
sun
the
voyagers
visited
the
natchez
indians
near
the
site
of
the
present
city
of
that
name
where
they
found
a
religious
and
political
despotism
a
privileged
class
descended
from
the
sun
a
temple
and
a
sacred
fire
it
must
have
been
like
getting
home
again
it
was
home
with
an
advantage
in
fact
for
it
lacked
louis
xiv
a
few
more
days
swept
swiftly
by
and
la
salle
stood
in
the
shadow
of
his
confiscating
cross
at
the
meeting
of
the
waters
from
delaware
and
from
itaska
and
from
the
mountain
ranges
close
upon
the
pacific
with
the
waters
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
his
task
finished
his
prodigy
achieved
mr
parkman
in
closing
his
fascinating
narrative
thus
sums
up
on
that
day
the
realm
of
france
received
on
parchment
a
stupendous
accession
the
fertile
plains
of
texas
the
vast
basin
of
the
mississippi
from
its
frozen
northern
springs
to
the
sultry
borders
of
the
gulf
from
the
woody
ridges
of
the
alleghanies
to
the
bare
peaks
of
the
rocky
mountains
a
region
of
savannas
and
forests
sun
cracked
deserts
and
grassy
prairies
watered
by
a
thousand
rivers
ranged
by
a
thousand
warlike
tribes
passed
beneath
the
scepter
of
the
sultan
of
versailles
and
all
by
virtue
of
a
feeble
human
voice
inaudible
at
half
a
mile
chapter
frescoes
from
the
past
apparently
the
river
was
ready
for
business
now
but
no
the
distribution
of
a
population
along
its
banks
was
as
calm
and
deliberate
and
time
devouring
a
process
as
the
discovery
and
exploration
had
been
seventy
years
elapsed
after
the
exploration
before
the
river's
borders
had
a
white
population
worth
considering
and
nearly
fifty
more
before
the
river
had
a
commerce
between
la
salle's
opening
of
the
river
and
the
time
when
it
may
be
said
to
have
become
the
vehicle
of
anything
like
a
regular
and
active
commerce
seven
sovereigns
had
occupied
the
throne
of
england
america
had
become
an
independent
nation
louis
xiv
and
louis
xv
had
rotted
and
died
the
french
monarchy
had
gone
down
in
the
red
tempest
of
the
revolution
and
napoleon
was
a
name
that
was
beginning
to
be
talked
about
truly
there
were
snails
in
those
days
the
river's
earliest
commerce
was
in
great
barges
keelboats
broadhorns
they
floated
and
sailed
from
the
upper
rivers
to
new
orleans
changed
cargoes
there
and
were
tediously
warped
and
poled
back
by
hand
a
voyage
down
and
back
sometimes
occupied
nine
months
in
time
this
commerce
increased
until
it
gave
employment
to
hordes
of
rough
and
hardy
men
rude
uneducated
brave
suffering
terrific
hardships
with
sailor
like
stoicism
heavy
drinkers
coarse
frolickers
in
moral
sties
like
the
natchez
under
the
hill
of
that
day
heavy
fighters
reckless
fellows
every
one
elephantinely
jolly
foul
witted
profane
prodigal
of
their
money
bankrupt
at
the
end
of
the
trip
fond
of
barbaric
finery
prodigious
braggarts
yet
in
the
main
honest
trustworthy
faithful
to
promises
and
duty
and
often
picturesquely
magnanimous
by
and
by
the
steamboat
intruded
then
for
fifteen
or
twenty
years
these
men
continued
to
run
their
keelboats
down
stream
and
the
steamers
did
all
of
the
upstream
business
the
keelboatmen
selling
their
boats
in
new
orleans
and
returning
home
as
deck
passengers
in
the
steamers
but
after
a
while
the
steamboats
so
increased
in
number
and
in
speed
that
they
were
able
to
absorb
the
entire
commerce
and
then
keelboating
died
a
permanent
death
the
keelboatman
became
a
deck
hand
or
a
mate
or
a
pilot
on
the
steamer
and
when
steamer
berths
were
not
open
to
him
he
took
a
berth
on
a
pittsburgh
coal
flat
or
on
a
pine
raft
constructed
in
the
forests
up
toward
the
sources
of
the
mississippi
in
the
heyday
of
the
steamboating
prosperity
the
river
from
end
to
end
was
flaked
with
coal
fleets
and
timber
rafts
all
managed
by
hand
and
employing
hosts
of
the
rough
characters
whom
i
have
been
trying
to
describe
i
remember
the
annual
processions
of
mighty
rafts
that
used
to
glide
by
hannibal
when
i
was
a
boy
an
acre
or
so
of
white
sweet
smelling
boards
in
each
raft
a
crew
of
two
dozen
men
or
more
three
or
four
wigwams
scattered
about
the
raft's
vast
level
space
for
storm
quarters
and
i
remember
the
rude
ways
and
the
tremendous
talk
of
their
big
crews
the
ex
keelboatmen
and
their
admiringly
patterning
successors
for
we
used
to
swim
out
a
quarter
or
third
of
a
mile
and
get
on
these
rafts
and
have
a
ride
by
way
of
illustrating
keelboat
talk
and
manners
and
that
now
departed
and
hardly
remembered
raft
life
i
will
throw
in
in
this
place
a
chapter
from
a
book
which
i
have
been
working
at
by
fits
and
starts
during
the
past
five
or
six
years
and
may
possibly
finish
in
the
course
of
five
or
six
more
the
book
is
a
story
which
details
some
passages
in
the
life
of
an
ignorant
village
boy
huck
finn
son
of
the
town
drunkard
of
my
time
out
west
there
he
has
run
away
from
his
persecuting
father
and
from
a
persecuting
good
widow
who
wishes
to
make
a
nice
truth
telling
respectable
boy
of
him
and
with
him
a
slave
of
the
widow's
has
also
escaped
they
have
found
a
fragment
of
a
lumber
raft
it
is
high
water
and
dead
summer
time
and
are
floating
down
the
river
by
night
and
hiding
in
the
willows
by
day
bound
for
cairo
whence
the
negro
will
seek
freedom
in
the
heart
of
the
free
states
but
in
a
fog
they
pass
cairo
without
knowing
it
by
and
by
they
begin
to
suspect
the
truth
and
huck
finn
is
persuaded
to
end
the
dismal
suspense
by
swimming
down
to
a
huge
raft
which
they
have
seen
in
the
distance
ahead
of
them
creeping
aboard
under
cover
of
the
darkness
and
gathering
the
needed
information
by
eavesdropping
but
you
know
a
young
person
can't
wait
very
well
when
he
is
impatient
to
find
a
thing
out
we
talked
it
over
and
by
and
by
jim
said
it
was
such
a
black
night
now
that
it
wouldn't
be
no
risk
to
swim
down
to
the
big
raft
and
crawl
aboard
and
listen
they
would
talk
about
cairo
because
they
would
be
calculating
to
go
ashore
there
for
a
spree
maybe
or
anyway
they
would
send
boats
ashore
to
buy
whiskey
or
fresh
meat
or
something
jim
had
a
wonderful
level
head
for
a
nigger
he
could
most
always
start
a
good
plan
when
you
wanted
one
i
stood
up
and
shook
my
rags
off
and
jumped
into
the
river
and
struck
out
for
the
raft's
light
by
and
by
when
i
got
down
nearly
to
her
i
eased
up
and
went
slow
and
cautious
but
everything
was
all
right
nobody
at
the
sweeps
so
i
swum
down
along
the
raft
till
i
was
most
abreast
the
camp
fire
in
the
middle
then
i
crawled
aboard
and
inched
along
and
got
in
amongst
some
bundles
of
shingles
on
the
weather
side
of
the
fire
there
was
thirteen
men
there
they
was
the
watch
on
deck
of
course
and
a
mighty
rough
looking
lot
too
they
had
a
jug
and
tin
cups
and
they
kept
the
jug
moving
one
man
was
singing
roaring
you
may
say
and
it
wasn't
a
nice
song
for
a
parlor
anyway
he
roared
through
his
nose
and
strung
out
the
last
word
of
every
line
very
long
when
he
was
done
they
all
fetched
a
kind
of
injun
war
whoop
and
then
another
was
sung
it
begun
there
was
a
woman
in
our
towdn
in
our
towdn
did
dwed'l
dwell
she
loved
her
husband
dear
i
lee
but
another
man
twysteas
wed'l
singing
too
riloo
riloo
riloo
ri
too
riloo
rilay
she
loved
her
husband
dear
i
lee
but
another
man
twyste
as
wed'l
and
so
on
fourteen
verses
it
was
kind
of
poor
and
when
he
was
going
to
start
on
the
next
verse
one
of
them
said
it
was
the
tune
the
old
cow
died
on
and
another
one
said
oh
give
us
a
rest
and
another
one
told
him
to
take
a
walk
they
made
fun
of
him
till
he
got
mad
and
jumped
up
and
begun
to
cuss
the
crowd
and
said
he
could
lame
any
thief
in
the
lot
they
was
all
about
to
make
a
break
for
him
but
the
biggest
man
there
jumped
up
and
says
set
whar
you
are
gentlemen
leave
him
to
me
he's
my
meat
then
he
jumped
up
in
the
air
three
times
and
cracked
his
heels
together
every
time
he
flung
off
a
buckskin
coat
that
was
all
hung
with
fringes
and
says
you
lay
thar
tell
the
chawin
up's
done
and
flung
his
hat
down
which
was
all
over
ribbons
and
says
you
lay
thar
tell
his
sufferin's
is
over
then
he
jumped
up
in
the
air
and
cracked
his
heels
together
again
and
shouted
out
whoo
oop
i'm
the
old
original
iron
jawed
brass
mounted
copper
bellied
corpse
maker
from
the
wilds
of
arkansaw
look
at
me
i'm
the
man
they
call
sudden
death
and
general
desolation
sired
by
a
hurricane
dam'd
by
an
earthquake
half
brother
to
the
cholera
nearly
related
to
the
small
pox
on
the
mother's
side
look
at
me
i
take
nineteen
alligators
and
a
bar'l
of
whiskey
for
breakfast
when
i'm
in
robust
health
and
a
bushel
of
rattlesnakes
and
a
dead
body
when
i'm
ailing
i
split
the
everlasting
rocks
with
my
glance
and
i
squench
the
thunder
when
i
speak
whoo
oop
stand
back
and
give
me
room
according
to
my
strength
blood's
my
natural
drink
and
the
wails
of
the
dying
is
music
to
my
ear
cast
your
eye
on
me
gentlemen
and
lay
low
and
hold
your
breath
for
i'm
bout
to
turn
myself
loose
all
the
time
he
was
getting
this
off
he
was
shaking
his
head
and
looking
fierce
and
kind
of
swelling
around
in
a
little
circle
tucking
up
his
wrist
bands
and
now
and
then
straightening
up
and
beating
his
breast
with
his
fist
saying
look
at
me
gentlemen
when
he
got
through
he
jumped
up
and
cracked
his
heels
together
three
times
and
let
off
a
roaring
whoo
oop
i'm
the
bloodiest
son
of
a
wildcat
that
lives
then
the
man
that
had
started
the
row
tilted
his
old
slouch
hat
down
over
his
right
eye
then
he
bent
stooping
forward
with
his
back
sagged
and
his
south
end
sticking
out
far
and
his
fists
a
shoving
out
and
drawing
in
in
front
of
him
and
so
went
around
in
a
little
circle
about
three
times
swelling
himself
up
and
breathing
hard
then
he
straightened
and
jumped
up
and
cracked

he
jumped
up
and
cracked
his
heels
together
three
times
before
he
lit
they
cheered
him
again
and
as
he
come
down
he
shouted
out
whoo
oop
bow
your
neck
and
spread
for
the
pet
child
of
calamity's
a
coming
then
the
other
one
went
to
swelling
around
and
blowing
again
the
first
one
the
one
they
called
bob
next
the
child
of
calamity
chipped
in
again
bigger
than
ever
then
they
both
got
at
it
at
the
same
time
swelling
round
and
round
each
other
and
punching
their
fists
most
into
each
other's
faces
and
whooping
and
jawing
like
injuns
then
bob
called
the
child
names
and
the
child
called
him
names
back
again
next
bob
called
him
a
heap
rougher
names
and
the
child
come
back
at
him
with
the
very
worst
kind
of
language
next
bob
knocked
the
child's
hat
off
and
the
child
picked
it
up
and
kicked
bob's
ribbony
hat
about
six
foot
bob
went
and
got
it
and
said
never
mind
this
warn't
going
to
be
the
last
of
this
thing
because
he
was
a
man
that
never
forgot
and
never
forgive
and
so
the
child
better
look
out
for
there
was
a
time
a
coming
just
as
sure
as
he
was
a
living
man
that
he
would
have
to
answer
to
him
with
the
best
blood
in
his
body
the
child
said
no
man
was
willinger
than
he
was
for
that
time
to
come
and
he
would
give
bob
fair
warning
now
never
to
cross
his
path
again
for
he
could
never
rest
till
he
had
waded
in
his
blood
for
such
was
his
nature
though
he
was
sparing
him
now
on
account
of
his
family
if
he
had
one
both
of
them
was
edging
away
in
different
directions
growling
and
shaking
their
heads
and
going
on
about
what
they
was
going
to
do
but
a
little
black
whiskered
chap
skipped
up
and
says
come
back
here
you
couple
of
chicken
livered
cowards
and
i'll
thrash
the
two
of
ye
and
he
done
it
too
he
snatched
them
he
jerked
them
this
way
and
that
he
booted
them
around
he
knocked
them
sprawling
faster
than
they
could
get
up
why
it
warn't
two
minutes
till
they
begged
like
dogs
and
how
the
other
lot
did
yell
and
laugh
and
clap
their
hands
all
the
way
through
and
shout
sail
in
corpse
maker
hi
at
him
again
child
of
calamity
bully
for
you
little
davy
well
it
was
a
perfect
pow
wow
for
a
while
bob
and
the
child
had
red
noses
and
black
eyes
when
they
got
through
little
davy
made
them
own
up
that
they
were
sneaks
and
cowards
and
not
fit
to
eat
with
a
dog
or
drink
with
a
nigger
then
bob
and
the
child
shook
hands
with
each
other
very
solemn
and
said
they
had
always
respected
each
other
and
was
willing
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
so
then
they
washed
their
faces
in
the
river
and
just
then
there
was
a
loud
order
to
stand
by
for
a
crossing
and
some
of
them
went
forward
to
man
the
sweeps
there
and
the
rest
went
aft
to
handle
the
after
sweeps
i
laid
still
and
waited
for
fifteen
minutes
and
had
a
smoke
out
of
a
pipe
that
one
of
them
left
in
reach
then
the
crossing
was
finished
and
they
stumped
back
and
had
a
drink
around
and
went
to
talking
and
singing
again
next
they
got
out
an
old
fiddle
and
one
played
and
another
patted
juba
and
the
rest
turned
themselves
loose
on
a
regular
old
fashioned
keel
boat
break
down
they
couldn't
keep
that
up
very
long
without
getting
winded
so
by
and
by
they
settled
around
the
jug
again
they
sung
jolly
jolly
raftman's
the
life
for
me
with
a
rousing
chorus
and
then
they
got
to
talking
about
differences
betwixt
hogs
and
their
different
kind
of
habits
and
next
about
women
and
their
different
ways
and
next
about
the
best
ways
to
put
out
houses
that
was
afire
and
next
about
what
ought
to
be
done
with
the
injuns
and
next
about
what
a
king
had
to
do
and
how
much
he
got
and
next
about
how
to
make
cats
fight
and
next
about
what
to
do
when
a
man
has
fits
and
next
about
differences
betwixt
clear
water
rivers
and
muddy
water
ones
the
man
they
called
ed
said
the
muddy
mississippi
water
was
wholesomer
to
drink
than
the
clear
water
of
the
ohio
he
said
if
you
let
a
pint
of
this
yaller
mississippi
water
settle
you
would
have
about
a
half
to
three
quarters
of
an
inch
of
mud
in
the
bottom
according
to
the
stage
of
the
river
and
then
it
warn't
no
better
than
ohio
water
what
you
wanted
to
do
was
to
keep
it
stirred
up
and
when
the
river
was
low
keep
mud
on
hand
to
put
in
and
thicken
the
water
up
the
way
it
ought
to
be
the
child
of
calamity
said
that
was
so
he
said
there
was
nutritiousness
in
the
mud
and
a
man
that
drunk
mississippi
water
could
grow
corn
in
his
stomach
if
he
wanted
to
he
says
you
look
at
the
graveyards
that
tells
the
tale
trees
won't
grow
worth
chucks
in
a
cincinnati
graveyard
but
in
a
sent
louis
graveyard
they
grow
upwards
of
eight
hundred
foot
high
it's
all
on
account
of
the
water
the
people
drunk
before
they
laid
up
a
cincinnati
corpse
don't
richen
a
soil
any
and
they
talked
about
how
ohio
water
didn't
like
to
mix
with
mississippi
water
ed
said
if
you
take
the
mississippi
on
a
rise
when
the
ohio
is
low
you'll
find
a
wide
band
of
clear
water
all
the
way
down
the
east
side
of
the
mississippi
for
a
hundred
mile
or
more
and
the
minute
you
get
out
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
shore
and
pass
the
line
it
is
all
thick
and
yaller
the
rest
of
the
way
across
then
they
talked
about
how
to
keep
tobacco
from
getting
moldy
and
from
that
they
went
into
ghosts
and
told
about
a
lot
that
other
folks
had
seen
but
ed
says
why
don't
you
tell
something
that
you've
seen
yourselves
now
let
me
have
a
say
five
years
ago
i
was
on
a
raft
as
big
as
this
and
right
along
here
it
was
a
bright
moonshiny
night
and
i
was
on
watch
and
boss
of
the
stabboard
oar
forrard
and
one
of
my
pards
was
a
man
named
dick
allbright
and
he
come
along
to
where
i
was
sitting
forrard
gaping
and
stretching
he
was
and
stooped
down
on
the
edge
of
the
raft
and
washed
his
face
in
the
river
and
come
and
set
down
by
me
and
got
out
his
pipe
and
had
just
got
it
filled
when
he
looks
up
and
says
why
looky
here
he
says
ain't
that
buck
miller's
place
over
yander
in
the
bend
yes
says
i
it
is
why
he
laid
his
pipe
down
and
leant
his
head
on
his
hand
and
says
i
thought
we'd
be
furder
down
i
says
i
thought
it
too
when
i
went
off
watch
we
was
standing
six
hours
on
and
six
off
but
the
boys
told
me
i
says
that
the
raft
didn't
seem
to
hardly
move
for
the
last
hour
says
i
though
she's
a
slipping
along
all
right
now
says
i
he
give
a
kind
of
a
groan
and
says
i've
seed
a
raft
act
so
before
along
here
he
says
pears
to
me
the
current
has
most
quit
above
the
head
of
this
bend
durin
the
last
two
years
he
says
well
he
raised
up
two
or
three
times
and
looked
away
off
and
around
on
the
water
that
started
me
at
it
too
a
body
is
always
doing
what
he
sees
somebody
else
doing
though
there
mayn't
be
no
sense
in
it
pretty
soon
i
see
a
black
something
floating
on
the
water
away
off
to
stabboard
and
quartering
behind
us
i
see
he
was
looking
at
it
too
i
says
what's
that
he
says
sort
of
pettish
tain't
nothing
but
an
old
empty
bar'l
an
empty
bar'l
says
i
why
says
i
a
spy
glass
is
a
fool
to
your
eyes
how
can
you
tell
it's
an
empty
bar'l
he
says
i
don't
know
i
reckon
it
ain't
a
bar'l
but
i
thought
it
might
be
says
he
yes
i
says
so
it
might
be
and
it
might
be
anything
else
too
a
body
can't
tell
nothing
about
it
such
a
distance
as
that
i
says
we
hadn't
nothing
else
to
do
so
we
kept
on
watching
it
by
and
by
i
says
why
looky
here
dick
allbright
that
thing's
a
gaining
on
us
i
believe
he
never
said
nothing
the
thing
gained
and
gained
and
i
judged
it
must
be
a
dog
that
was
about
tired
out
well
we
swung
down
into
the
crossing
and
the
thing
floated
across
the
bright
streak
of
the
moonshine
and
by
george
it
was
bar'l
says
i
dick
allbright
what
made
you
think
that
thing
was
a
bar'l
when
it
was
a
half
a
mile
off
says
i
says
he
i
don't
know
says
i
you
tell
me
dick
allbright
he
says
well
i
knowed
it
was
a
bar'l
i've
seen
it
before
lots
has
seen
it
they
says
it's
a
haunted
bar'l
i
called
the
rest
of
the
watch
and
they
come
and
stood
there
and
i
told
them
what
dick
said
it
floated
right
along
abreast
now
and
didn't
gain
any
more
it
was
about
twenty
foot
off
some
was
for
having
it
aboard
but
the
rest
didn't
want
to
dick
allbright
said
rafts
that
had
fooled
with
it
had
got
bad
luck
by
it
the
captain
of
the
watch
said
he
didn't
believe
in
it
he
said
he
reckoned
the
bar'l
gained
on
us
because
it
was
in
a
little
better
current
than
what
we
was
he
said
it
would
leave
by
and
by
so
then
we
went
to
talking
about
other
things
and
we
had
a
song
and
then
a
breakdown
and
after
that
the
captain
of
the
watch
called
for
another
song
but
it
was
clouding
up
now
and
the
bar'l
stuck
right
thar
in
the
same
place
and
the
song
didn't
seem
to
have
much
warm
up
to
it
somehow
and
so
they
didn't
finish
it
and
there
warn't
any
cheers
but
it
sort
of
dropped
flat
and
nobody
said
anything
for
a
minute
then
everybody
tried
to
talk
at
once
and
one
chap
got
off
a
joke
but
it
warn't
no
use
they
didn't
laugh
and
even
the
chap
that
made
the
joke
didn't
laugh
at
it
which
ain't
usual
we
all
just
settled
down
glum
and
watched
the
bar'l
and
was
oneasy
and
oncomfortable
well
sir
it
shut
down
black
and
still
and
then
the
wind
begin
to
moan
around
and
next
the
lightning
begin
to
play
and
the
thunder
to
grumble
and
pretty
soon
there
was
a
regular
storm
and
in
the
middle
of
it
a
man
that
was
running
aft
stumbled
and
fell
and
sprained
his
ankle
so
that
he
had
to
lay
up
this
made
the
boys
shake
their
heads
and
every
time
the
lightning
come
there
was
that
bar'l
with
the
blue
lights
winking
around
it
we
was
always
on
the
look
out
for
it
but
by
and
by
towards
dawn
she
was
gone
when
the
day
come
we
couldn't
see
her
anywhere
and
we
warn't
sorry
neither
but
next
night
about
half
past
nine
when
there
was
songs
and
high
jinks
going
on
here
she
comes
again
and
took
her
old
roost
on
the
stabboard
side
there
warn't
no
more
high
jinks
everybody
got
solemn
nobody
talked
you
couldn't
get
anybody
to
do
anything
but
set
around
moody
and
look
at
the
bar'l
it
begun
to
cloud
up
again
when
the
watch
changed
the
off
watch
stayed
up
stead
of
turning
in
the
storm
ripped
and
roared
around
all
night
and
in
the
middle
of
it
another
man
tripped
and
sprained
his
ankle
and
had
to
knock
off
the
bar'l
left
towards
day
and
nobody
see
it
go
everybody
was
sober
and
down
in
the
mouth
all
day
i
don't
mean
the
kind
of
sober
that
comes
of
leaving
liquor
alone
not
that
they
was
quiet
but
they
all
drunk
more
than
usual
not
together
but
each
man
sidled
off
and
took
it
private
by
himself
after
dark
the
off
watch
didn't
turn
in
nobody
sung
nobody
talked
the
boys
didn't
scatter
around
neither
they
sort
of
huddled
together
forrard
and
for
two
hours
they
set
there
perfectly
still
looking
steady
in
the
one
direction
and
heaving
a
sigh
once
in
a
while
and
then
here
comes
the
bar'l
again
she
took
up
her
old
place
she
staid
there
all
night
nobody
turned
in
the
storm
come
on
again
after
midnight
it
got
awful
dark
the
rain
poured
down
hail
too
the
thunder
boomed
and
roared
and
bellowed
the
wind
blowed
a
hurricane
and
the
lightning
spread
over
everything
in
big
sheets
of
glare
and
showed
the
whole
raft
as
plain
as
day
and
the
river
lashed
up
white
as
milk
as
far
as
you
could
see
for
miles
and
there
was
that
bar'l
jiggering
along
same
as
ever
the
captain
ordered
the
watch
to
man
the
after
sweeps
for
a
crossing
and
nobody
would
go
no
more
sprained
ankles
for
them
they
said
they
wouldn't
even
walk
aft
well
then
just
then
the
sky
split
wide
open
with
a
crash
and
the
lightning
killed
two
men
of
the
after
watch
and
crippled
two
more
crippled
them
how
says
you
why
sprained
their
ankles
the
bar'l
left
in
the
dark
betwixt
lightnings
towards
dawn
well
not
a
body
eat
a
bite
at
breakfast
that
morning
after
that
the
men
loafed
around
in
twos
and
threes
and
talked
low
together
but
none
of
them
herded
with
dick
allbright
they
all
give
him
the
cold
shake
if
he
come
around
where
any
of
the
men
was
they
split
up
and
sidled
away
they
wouldn't
man
the
sweeps
with
him
the
captain
had
all
the
skiffs
hauled
up
on
the
raft
alongside
of
his
wigwam
and
wouldn't
let
the
dead
men
be
took
ashore
to
be
planted
he
didn't
believe
a
man
that
got
ashore
would
come
back
and
he
was
right
after
night
come
you
could
see
pretty
plain
that
there
was
going
to
be
trouble
if
that
bar'l
come
again
there
was
such
a
muttering
going
on
a
good
many
wanted
to
kill
dick
allbright
because
he'd
seen
the
bar'l
on
other
trips
and
that
had
an
ugly
look
some
wanted
to
put
him
ashore
some
said
let's
all
go
ashore
in
a
pile
if
the
bar'l
comes
again
this
kind
of
whispers
was
still
going
on
the
men
being
bunched
together
forrard
watching
for
the
bar'l
when
lo
and
behold
you
here
she
comes
again
down
she
comes
slow
and
steady
and
settles
into
her
old
tracks
you
could
a
heard
a
pin
drop
then
up
comes
the
captain
and
says
boys
don't
be
a
pack
of
children
and
fools
i
don't
want
this
bar'l
to
be
dogging
us
all
the
way
to
orleans
and
you
don't
well
then
how's
the
best
way
to
stop
it
burn
it
up
that's
the
way
i'm
going
to
fetch
it
aboard
he
says
and
before
anybody
could
say
a
word
in
he
went
he
swum
to
it
and
as
he
come
pushing
it
to
the
raft
the
men
spread
to
one
side
but
the
old
man
got
it
aboard
and
busted
in
the
head
and
there
was
a
baby
in
it
yes
sir
a
stark
naked
baby
it
was
dick
allbright's
baby
he
owned
up
and
said
so
yes
he
says
a
leaning
over
it
yes
it
is
my
own
lamented
darling
my
poor
lost
charles
william
allbright
deceased
says
he
for
he
could
curl
his
tongue
around
the
bulliest
words
in
the
language
when
he
was
a
mind
to
and
lay
them
before
you
without
a
jint
started
anywheres
yes
he
said
he
used
to
live
up
at
the
head
of
this
bend
and
one
night
he
choked
his
child
which
was
crying
not
intending
to
kill
it
which
was
prob'ly
a
lie
and
then
he
was
scared
and
buried
it
in
a
bar'l
before
his
wife
got
home
and
off
he
went
and
struck
the
northern
trail
and
went
to
rafting
and
this
was
the
third
year
that
the
bar'l
had
chased
him
he
said
the
bad
luck
always
begun
light
and
lasted
till
four
men
was
killed
and
then
the
bar'l
didn't
come
any
more
after
that
he
said
if
the
men
would
stand
it
one
more
night
and
was
a
going
on
like
that
but
the
men
had
got
enough
they
started
to
get
out
a
boat
to
take
him
ashore
and
lynch
him
but
he
grabbed
the
little
child
all
of
a
sudden
and
jumped
overboard
with
it
hugged
up
to
his
breast
and
shedding
tears
and
we
never
see
him
again
in
this
life
poor
old
suffering
soul
nor
charles
william
neither
who
was
shedding
tears
says
bob

the
fire

an
account
of

a
quarter
of
a
minute

just
says
charles
william
allbright
sir
then
they
roared
the
whole
crowd
and
i
was
mighty
glad
i
said
that
because
maybe
laughing
would
get
them
in
a
better
humor
when
they
got
done
laughing
davy
says
it
won't
hardly
do
charles
william

traded
up
and
down
here
all
his
life
and
he
told
me
to
swim
off

because
when
you
went
by
he
said
he
would
like
to
get
some
of
you
to
speak
to
a
mr
jonas
turner
in
cairo
and
tell
him

davy

you
live
in
a
scow
or
is
it
a
lie
yes
sir
in
a
trading
scow
she
lays
up
at
the
head
of
the
bend
but
i
warn't
born
in
her
it's
our
first
trip
now
you're
talking
what
did
you
come
aboard
here
for
to
steal
no
sir
i
didn't
it
was
only
to
get
a
ride
on
the
raft
all
boys
does
that
well
i
know
that
but
what
did
you
hide
for
sometimes
they
drive
the
boys
off
so
they
do
they
might
steal
looky
here
if
we
let
you
off
this
time
will
you
keep
out
of
these
kind
of
scrapes
hereafter
deed
i
will
boss
you
try
me
all
right
then
you
ain't
but
little
ways
from
shore
overboard
with
you
and
don't
you
make
a
fool
of
yourself
another
time
this
way
blast
it
boy
some
raftsmen
would
rawhide
you
till
you
were
black
and
blue
i
didn't
wait
to
kiss
good
bye
but
went
overboard
and
broke
for
shore
when
jim
come
along
by
and
by
the
big
raft
was
away
out
of
sight
around
the
point
i
swum
out
and
got
aboard
and
was
mighty
glad
to
see
home
again
the
boy
did
not
get
the
information
he
was
after
but
his
adventure
has
furnished
the
glimpse
of
the
departed
raftsman
and
keelboatman
which
i
desire
to
offer
in
this
place
i
now
come
to
a
phase
of
the
mississippi
river
life
of
the
flush
times
of
steamboating
which
seems
to
me
to
warrant
full
examination
the
marvelous
science
of
piloting
as
displayed
there
i
believe
there
has
been
nothing
like
it
elsewhere
in
the
world
chapter
the
boys
ambition
when
i
was
a
boy
there
was
but
one
permanent
ambition
among
my
comrades
in
our
village
footnote
hannibal
on
the
west
bank
of
the
mississippi
river
that
was
to
be
a
steamboatman
we
had
transient
ambitions
of
other
sorts
but
they
were
only
transient
when
a
circus
came
and
went
it
left
us
all
burning
to
become
clowns
the
first
negro
minstrel
show
that
came
to
our
section
left
us
all
suffering
to
try
that
kind
of
life
now
and
then
we
had
a
hope
that
if
we
lived
and
were
good
god
would
permit
us
to
be
pirates
these
ambitions
faded
out
each
in
its
turn
but
the
ambition
to
be
a
steamboatman
always
remained
once
a
day
a
cheap
gaudy
packet
arrived
upward
from
st
louis
and
another
downward
from
keokuk
before
these
events
the
day
was
glorious
with
expectancy
after
them
the
day
was
a
dead
and
empty
thing
not
only
the
boys
but
the
whole
village
felt
this
after
all
these
years
i
can
picture
that
old
time
to
myself
now
just
as
it
was
then
the
white
town
drowsing
in
the
sunshine
of
a
summer's
morning
the
streets
empty
or
pretty
nearly
so
one
or
two
clerks
sitting
in
front
of
the
water
street
stores
with
their
splint
bottomed
chairs
tilted
back
against
the
wall
chins
on
breasts
hats
slouched
over
their
faces
asleep
with
shingle
shavings
enough
around
to
show
what
broke
them
down
a
sow
and
a
litter
of
pigs
loafing
along
the
sidewalk
doing
a
good
business
in
watermelon
rinds
and
seeds
two
or
three
lonely
little
freight
piles
scattered
about
the
levee
a
pile
of
skids
on
the
slope
of
the
stone
paved
wharf
and
the
fragrant
town
drunkard
asleep
in
the
shadow
of
them
two
or
three
wood
flats
at
the
head
of
the
wharf
but
nobody
to
listen
to
the
peaceful
lapping
of
the
wavelets
against
them
the
great
mississippi
the
majestic
the
magnificent
mississippi
rolling
its
mile
wide
tide
along
shining
in
the
sun
the
dense
forest
away
on
the
other
side
the
point
above
the
town
and
the
point
below
bounding
the
river
glimpse
and
turning
it
into
a
sort
of
sea
and
withal
a
very
still
and
brilliant
and
lonely
one
presently
a
film
of
dark
smoke
appears
above
one
of
those
remote
points
instantly
a
negro
drayman
famous
for
his
quick
eye
and
prodigious
voice
lifts
up
the
cry
s
t
e
a
m
boat
a
comin
and
the
scene
changes
the
town
drunkard
stirs
the
clerks
wake
up
a
furious
clatter
of
drays
follows
every
house
and
store
pours
out
a
human
contribution
and
all
in
a
twinkling
the
dead
town
is
alive
and
moving
drays
carts
men
boys
all
go
hurrying
from
many
quarters
to
a
common
center
the
wharf
assembled
there
the
people
fasten
their
eyes
upon
the
coming
boat
as
upon
a
wonder
they
are
seeing
for
the
first
time
and
the
boat
is
rather
a
handsome
sight
too
she
is
long
and
sharp
and
trim
and
pretty
she
has
two
tall
fancy
topped
chimneys
with
a
gilded
device
of
some
kind
swung
between
them
a
fanciful
pilot
house
a
glass
and
gingerbread
perched
on
top
of
the
texas
deck
behind
them
the
paddle
boxes
are
gorgeous
with
a
picture
or
with
gilded
rays
above
the
boat's
name
the
boiler
deck
the
hurricane
deck
and
the
texas
deck
are
fenced
and
ornamented
with
clean
white
railings
there
is
a
flag
gallantly
flying
from
the
jack
staff
the
furnace
doors
are
open
and
the
fires
glaring
bravely
the
upper
decks
are
black
with
passengers
the
captain
stands
by
the
big
bell
calm
imposing
the
envy
of
all
great
volumes
of
the
blackest
smoke
are
rolling
and
tumbling
out
of
the
chimneys
a
husbanded
grandeur
created
with
a
bit
of
pitch
pine
just
before
arriving
at
a
town
the
crew
are
grouped
on
the
forecastle
the
broad
stage
is
run
far
out
over
the
port
bow
and
an
envied
deckhand
stands
picturesquely
on
the
end
of
it
with
a
coil
of
rope
in
his
hand
the
pent
steam
is
screaming
through
the
gauge
cocks
the
captain
lifts
his
hand
a
bell
rings
the
wheels
stop
then
they
turn
back
churning
the
water
to
foam
and
the
steamer
is
at
rest
then
such
a
scramble
as
there
is
to
get
aboard
and
to
get
ashore
and
to
take
in
freight
and
to
discharge
freight
all
at
one
and
the
same
time
and
such
a
yelling
and
cursing
as
the
mates
facilitate
it
all
with
ten
minutes
later
the
steamer
is
under
way
again
with
no
flag
on
the
jack
staff
and
no
black
smoke
issuing
from
the
chimneys
after
ten
more
minutes
the
town
is
dead
again
and
the
town
drunkard
asleep
by
the
skids
once
more
my
father
was
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
i
supposed
he
possessed
the
power
of
life
and
death
over
all
men
and
could
hang
anybody
that
offended
him
this
was
distinction
enough
for
me
as
a
general
thing
but
the
desire
to
be
a
steamboatman
kept
intruding
nevertheless
i
first
wanted
to
be
a
cabin
boy
so
that
i
could
come
out
with
a
white
apron
on
and
shake
a
tablecloth
over
the
side
where
all
my
old
comrades
could
see
me
later
i
thought
i
would
rather
be
the
deckhand
who
stood
on
the
end
of
the
stage
plank
with
the
coil
of
rope
in
his
hand
because
he
was
particularly
conspicuous
but
these
were
only
day
dreams
they
were
too
heavenly
to
be
contemplated
as
real
possibilities
by
and
by
one
of
our
boys
went
away
he
was
not
heard
of
for
a
long
time
at
last
he
turned
up
as
apprentice
engineer
or
striker
on
a
steamboat
this
thing
shook
the
bottom
out
of
all
my
sunday
school
teachings
that
boy
had
been
notoriously
worldly
and
i
just
the
reverse
yet
he
was
exalted
to
this
eminence
and
i
left
in
obscurity
and
misery
there
was
nothing
generous
about
this
fellow
in
his
greatness
he
would
always
manage
to
have
a
rusty
bolt
to
scrub
while
his
boat
tarried
at
our
town
and
he
would
sit
on
the
inside
guard
and
scrub
it
where
we
could
all
see
him
and
envy
him
and
loathe
him
and
whenever
his
boat
was
laid
up
he
would
come
home
and
swell
around
the
town
in
his
blackest
and
greasiest
clothes
so
that
nobody
could
help
remembering
that
he
was
a
steamboatman
and
he
used
all
sorts
of
steamboat
technicalities
in
his
talk
as
if
he
were
so
used
to
them
that
he
forgot
common
people
could
not
understand
them
he
would
speak
of
the
labboard
side
of
a
horse
in
an
easy
natural
way
that
would
make
one
wish
he
was
dead
and
he
was
always
talking
about
st
looy
like
an
old
citizen
he
would
refer
casually
to
occasions
when
he
was
coming
down
fourth
street
or
when
he
was
passing
by
the
planter's
house
or
when
there
was
a
fire
and
he
took
a
turn
on
the
brakes
of
the
old
big
missouri
and
then
he
would
go
on
and
lie
about
how
many
towns
the
size
of
ours
were
burned
down
there
that
day
two
or
three
of
the
boys
had
long
been
persons
of
consideration
among
us
because
they
had
been
to
st
louis
once
and
had
a
vague
general
knowledge
of
its
wonders
but
the
day
of
their
glory
was
over
now
they
lapsed
into
a
humble
silence
and
learned
to
disappear
when
the
ruthless
cub
engineer
approached
this
fellow
had
money
too
and
hair
oil
also
an
ignorant
silver
watch
and
a
showy
brass
watch
chain
he
wore
a
leather
belt
and
used
no
suspenders
if
ever
a
youth
was
cordially
admired
and
hated
by
his
comrades
this
one
was
no
girl
could
withstand
his
charms
he
cut
out
every
boy
in
the
village
when
his
boat
blew
up
at
last
it
diffused
a
tranquil
contentment
among
us
such
as
we
had
not
known
for
months
but
when
he
came
home
the
next
week
alive
renowned
and
appeared
in
church
all
battered
up
and
bandaged
a
shining
hero
stared
at
and
wondered
over
by
everybody
it
seemed
to
us
that
the
partiality
of
providence
for
an
undeserving
reptile
had
reached
a
point
where
it
was
open
to
criticism
this
creature's
career
could
produce
but
one
result
and
it
speedily
followed
boy
after
boy
managed
to
get
on
the
river
the
minister's
son
became
an
engineer
the
doctor's
and
the
post
master's
sons
became
mud
clerks
the
wholesale
liquor
dealer's
son
became
a
barkeeper
on
a
boat
four
sons
of
the
chief
merchant
and
two
sons
of
the
county
judge
became
pilots
pilot
was
the
grandest
position
of
all
the
pilot
even
in
those
days
of
trivial
wages
had
a
princely
salary
from
a
hundred
and
fifty
to
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
month
and
no
board
to
pay
two
months
of
his
wages
would
pay
a
preacher's
salary
for
a
year
now
some
of
us
were
left
disconsolate
we
could
not
get
on
the
river
at
least
our
parents
would
not
let
us
so
by
and
by
i
ran
away
i
said
i
never
would
come
home
again
till
i
was
a
pilot
and
could
come
in
glory
but
somehow
i
could
not
manage
it
i
went
meekly
aboard
a
few
of
the
boats
that
lay
packed
together
like
sardines
at
the
long
st
louis
wharf
and
very
humbly
inquired
for
the
pilots
but
got
only
a
cold
shoulder
and
short
words
from
mates
and
clerks
i
had
to
make
the
best
of
this
sort
of
treatment
for
the
time
being
but
i
had
comforting
daydreams
of
a
future
when
i
should
be
a
great
and
honored
pilot
with
plenty
of
money
and
could
kill
some
of
these
mates
and
clerks
and
pay
for
them
chapter
i
want
to
be
a
cub
pilot
months
afterward
the
hope
within
me
struggled
to
a
reluctant
death
and
i
found
myself
without
an
ambition
but
i
was
ashamed
to
go
home
i
was
in
cincinnati
and
i
set
to
work
to
map
out
a
new
career
i
had
been
reading
about
the
recent
exploration
of
the
river
amazon
by
an
expedition
sent
out
by
our
government
it
was
said
that
the
expedition
owing
to
difficulties
had
not
thoroughly
explored
a
part
of
the
country
lying
about
the
head
waters
some
four
thousand
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
it
was
only
about
fifteen
hundred
miles
from
cincinnati
to
new
orleans
where
i
could
doubtless
get
a
ship
i
had
thirty
dollars
left
i
would
go
and
complete
the
exploration
of
the
amazon
this
was
all
the
thought
i
gave
to
the
subject
i
never
was
great
in
matters
of
detail
i
packed
my
valise
and
took
passage
on
an
ancient
tub
called
the
paul
jones
for
new
orleans
for
the
sum
of
sixteen
dollars
i
had
the
scarred
and
tarnished
splendors
of
her
main
saloon
principally
to
myself
for
she
was
not
a
creature
to
attract
the
eye
of
wiser
travelers
when
we
presently
got
under
way
and
went
poking
down
the
broad
ohio
i
became
a
new
being
and
the
subject
of
my
own
admiration
i
was
a
traveler
a
word
never
had
tasted
so
good
in
my
mouth
before
i
had
an
exultant
sense
of
being
bound
for
mysterious
lands
and
distant
climes
which
i
never
have
felt
in
so
uplifting
a
degree
since
i
was
in
such
a
glorified
condition
that
all
ignoble
feelings
departed
out
of
me
and
i
was
able
to
look
down
and
pity
the
untraveled
with
a
compassion
that
had
hardly
a
trace
of
contempt
in
it
still
when
we
stopped
at
villages
and
wood
yards
i
could
not
help
lolling
carelessly
upon
the
railings
of
the
boiler
deck
to
enjoy
the
envy
of
the
country
boys
on
the
bank
if
they
did
not
seem
to
discover
me
i
presently
sneezed
to
attract
their
attention
or
moved
to
a
position
where
they
could
not
help
seeing
me
and
as
soon
as
i
knew
they
saw
me
i
gaped
and
stretched
and
gave
other
signs
of
being
mightily
bored
with
traveling
i
kept
my
hat
off
all
the
time
and
stayed
where
the
wind
and
the
sun
could
strike
me
because
i
wanted
to
get
the
bronzed
and
weather
beaten
look
of
an
old
traveler
before
the
second
day
was
half
gone
i
experienced
a
joy
which
filled
me
with
the
purest
gratitude
for
i
saw
that
the
skin
had
begun
to
blister
and
peel
off
my
face
and
neck
i
wished
that
the
boys
and
girls
at
home
could
see
me
now
we
reached
louisville
in
time
at
least
the
neighborhood
of
it
we
stuck
hard
and
fast
on
the
rocks
in
the
middle
of
the
river
and
lay
there
four
days
i
was
now
beginning
to
feel
a
strong
sense
of
being
a
part
of
the
boat's
family
a
sort
of
infant
son
to
the
captain
and
younger
brother
to
the
officers
there
is
no
estimating
the
pride
i
took
in
this
grandeur
or
the
affection
that
began
to
swell
and
grow
in
me
for
those
people
i
could
not
know
how
the
lordly
steamboatman
scorns
that
sort
of
presumption
in
a
mere
landsman
i
particularly
longed
to
acquire
the
least
trifle
of
notice
from
the
big
stormy
mate
and
i
was
on
the
alert
for
an
opportunity
to
do
him
a
service
to
that
end
it
came
at
last
the
riotous
powwow
of
setting
a
spar
was
going
on
down
on
the
forecastle
and
i
went
down
there
and
stood
around
in
the
way
or
mostly
skipping
out
of
it
till
the
mate
suddenly
roared
a
general
order
for
somebody
to
bring
him
a
capstan
bar
i
sprang
to
his
side
and
said
tell
me
where
it
is
i'll
fetch
it
if
a
rag
picker
had
offered
to
do
a
diplomatic
service
for
the
emperor
of
russia
the
monarch
could
not
have
been
more
astounded
than
the
mate
was
he
even
stopped
swearing
he
stood
and
stared
down
at
me
it
took
him
ten
seconds
to
scrape
his
disjointed
remains
together
again
then
he
said
impressively
well
if
this
don't
beat
hell
and
turned
to
his
work
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
been
confronted
with
a
problem
too
abstruse
for
solution
i
crept
away
and
courted
solitude
for
the
rest
of
the
day
i
did
not
go
to
dinner
i
stayed
away
from
supper
until
everybody
else
had
finished
i
did
not
feel
so
much
like
a
member
of
the
boat's
family
now
as
before
however
my
spirits
returned
in
installments
as
we
pursued
our
way
down
the
river
i
was
sorry
i
hated
the
mate
so
because
it
was
not
in
young
human
nature
not
to
admire
him
he
was
huge
and
muscular
his
face
was
bearded
and
whiskered
all
over
he
had
a
red
woman
and
a
blue
woman
tattooed
on
his
right
arm
one
on
each
side
of
a
blue
anchor
with
a
red
rope
to
it
and
in
the
matter
of
profanity
he
was
sublime
when
he
was
getting
out
cargo
at
a
landing
i
was
always
where
i
could
see
and
hear
he
felt
all
the
majesty
of
his
great
position
and
made
the
world
feel
it
too
when
he
gave
even
the
simplest
order
he
discharged
it
like
a
blast
of
lightning
and
sent
a
long
reverberating
peal
of
profanity
thundering
after
it
i
could
not
help
contrasting
the
way
in
which
the
average
landsman
would
give
an
order
with
the
mate's
way
of
doing
it
if
the
landsman
should
wish
the
gang
plank
moved
a
foot
farther
forward
he
would
probably
say
james
or
william
one
of
you
push
that
plank
forward
please
but
put
the
mate
in
his
place
and
he
would
roar
out
here
now
start
that
gang
plank
for'ard
lively
now
what
re
you
about
snatch
it
snatch
it
there
there
aft
again
aft
again
don't
you
hear
me
dash
it
to
dash
are
you
going
to
sleep
over
it
vast
heaving
vast
heaving
i
tell
you
going
to
heave
it
clear
astern
where
re
you
going
with
that
barrel
for'ard
with
it
fore
i
make
you
swallow
it
you
dash
dash
dash
dashed
split
between
a
tired
mud
turtle
and
a
crippled
hearse
horse
i
wished
i
could
talk
like
that
when
the
soreness
of
my
adventure
with
the
mate
had
somewhat
worn
off
i
began
timidly
to
make
up
to
the
humblest
official
connected
with
the
boat
the
night
watchman
he
snubbed
my
advances
at
first
but
i
presently
ventured
to
offer
him
a
new
chalk
pipe
and
that
softened
him
so
he
allowed
me
to
sit
with
him
by
the
big
bell
on
the
hurricane
deck
and
in
time
he
melted
into
conversation
he
could
not
well
have
helped
it
i
hung
with
such
homage
on
his
words
and
so
plainly
showed
that
i
felt
honored
by
his
notice
he
told
me
the
names
of
dim
capes
and
shadowy
islands
as
we
glided
by
them
in
the
solemnity
of
the
night
under
the
winking
stars
and
by
and
by
got
to
talking
about
himself
he
seemed
over
sentimental
for
a
man
whose
salary
was
six
dollars
a
week
or
rather
he
might
have
seemed
so
to
an
older
person
than
i
but
i
drank
in
his
words
hungrily
and
with
a
faith
that
might
have
moved
mountains
if
it
had
been
applied
judiciously
what
was
it
to
me
that
he
was
soiled
and
seedy
and
fragrant
with
gin
what
was
it
to
me
that
his
grammar
was
bad
his
construction
worse
and
his
profanity
so
void
of
art
that
it
was
an
element
of
weakness
rather
than
strength
in
his
conversation
he
was
a
wronged
man
a
man
who
had
seen
trouble
and
that
was
enough
for
me
as
he
mellowed
into
his
plaintive
history
his
tears
dripped
upon
the
lantern
in
his
lap
and
i
cried
too
from
sympathy
he
said
he
was
the
son
of
an
english
nobleman
either
an
earl
or
an
alderman
he
could
not
remember
which
but
believed
was
both
his
father
the
nobleman
loved
him
but
his
mother
hated
him
from
the
cradle
and
so
while
he
was
still
a
little
boy
he
was
sent
to
one
of
them
old
ancient
colleges
he
couldn't
remember
which
and
by
and
by
his
father
died
and
his
mother
seized
the
property
and
shook
him
as
he
phrased
it
after
his
mother
shook
him
members
of
the
nobility
with
whom
he
was
acquainted
used
their
influence
to
get
him
the
position
of
loblolly
boy
in
a
ship
and
from
that
point
my
watchman
threw
off
all
trammels
of
date
and
locality
and
branched
out
into
a
narrative
that
bristled
all
along
with
incredible
adventures
a
narrative
that
was
so
reeking
with
bloodshed
and
so
crammed
with
hair
breadth
escapes
and
the
most
engaging
and
unconscious
personal
villainies
that
i
sat
speechless
enjoying
shuddering
wondering
worshipping
it
was
a
sore
blight
to
find
out
afterwards
that
he
was
a
low
vulgar
ignorant
sentimental
half
witted
humbug
an
untraveled
native
of
the
wilds
of
illinois
who
had
absorbed
wildcat
literature
and
appropriated
its
marvels
until
in
time
he
had
woven
odds
and
ends
of
the
mess
into
this
yarn
and
then
gone
on
telling
it
to
fledglings
like
me
until
he
had
come
to
believe
it
himself
chapter
a
cub
pilot's
experience
what
with
lying
on
the
rocks
four
days
at
louisville
and
some
other
delays
the
poor
old
paul
jones
fooled
away
about
two
weeks
in
making
the
voyage
from
cincinnati
to
new
orleans
this
gave
me
a
chance
to
get
acquainted
with
one
of
the
pilots
and
he
taught
me
how
to
steer
the
boat
and
thus
made
the
fascination
of
river
life
more
potent
than
ever
for
me
it
also
gave
me
a
chance
to
get
acquainted
with
a
youth
who
had
taken
deck
passage
more's
the
pity
for
he
easily
borrowed
six
dollars
of
me
on
a
promise
to
return
to
the
boat
and
pay
it
back
to
me
the
day
after
we
should
arrive
but
he
probably
died
or
forgot
for
he
never
came
it
was
doubtless
the
former
since
he
had
said
his
parents
were
wealthy
and
he
only
traveled
deck
passage
because
it
was
cooler
footnote
deck
passage
i
e
steerage
passage
i
soon
discovered
two
things
one
was
that
a
vessel
would
not
be
likely
to
sail
for
the
mouth
of
the
amazon
under
ten
or
twelve
years
and
the
other
was
that
the
nine
or
ten
dollars
still
left
in
my
pocket
would
not
suffice
for
so
imposing
an
exploration
as
i
had
planned
even
if
i
could
afford
to
wait
for
a
ship
therefore
it
followed
that
i
must
contrive
a
new
career
the
paul
jones
was
now
bound
for
st
louis
i
planned
a
siege
against
my
pilot
and
at
the
end
of
three
hard
days
he
surrendered
he
agreed
to
teach
me
the
mississippi
river
from
new
orleans
to
st
louis
for
five
hundred
dollars
payable
out
of
the
first
wages
i
should
receive
after
graduating
i
entered
upon
the
small
enterprise
of
learning
twelve
or
thirteen
hundred
miles
of
the
great
mississippi
river
with
the
easy
confidence
of
my
time
of
life
if
i
had
really
known
what
i
was
about
to
require
of
my
faculties
i
should
not
have
had
the
courage
to
begin
i
supposed
that
all
a
pilot
had
to
do
was
to
keep
his
boat
in
the
river
and
i
did
not
consider
that
that
could
be
much
of
a
trick
since
it
was
so
wide
the
boat
backed
out
from
new
orleans
at
four
in
the
afternoon
and
it
was
our
watch
until
eight
mr
bixby
my
chief
straightened
her
up
plowed
her
along
past
the
sterns
of
the
other
boats
that
lay
at
the
levee
and
then
said
here
take
her
shave
those
steamships
as
close
as
you'd
peel
an
apple
i
took
the
wheel
and
my
heart
beat
fluttered
up
into
the
hundreds
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
we
were
about
to
scrape
the
side
off
every
ship
in
the
line
we
were
so
close
i
held
my
breath
and
began
to
claw
the
boat
away
from
the
danger
and
i
had
my
own
opinion
of
the
pilot
who
had
known
no
better
than
to
get
us
into
such
peril
but
i
was
too
wise
to
express
it
in
half
a
minute
i
had
a
wide
margin
of
safety
intervening
between
the
paul
jones
and
the
ships
and
within
ten
seconds
more
i
was
set
aside
in
disgrace
and
mr
bixby
was
going
into
danger
again
and
flaying
me
alive
with
abuse
of
my
cowardice
i
was
stung
but
i
was
obliged
to
admire
the
easy
confidence
with
which
my
chief
loafed
from
side
to
side
of
his
wheel
and
trimmed
the
ships
so
closely
that
disaster
seemed
ceaselessly
imminent
when
he
had
cooled
a
little
he
told
me
that
the
easy
water
was
close
ashore
and
the
current
outside
and
therefore
we
must
hug
the
bank
up
stream
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
former
and
stay
well
out
down
stream
to
take
advantage
of
the
latter
in
my
own
mind
i
resolved
to
be
a
down
stream
pilot
and
leave
the
up
streaming
to
people
dead
to
prudence
now
and
then
mr
bixby
called
my
attention
to
certain
things
said
he
this
is
six
mile
point
i
assented
it
was
pleasant
enough
information
but
i
could
not
see
the
bearing
of
it
i
was
not
conscious
that
it
was
a
matter
of
any
interest
to
me
another
time
he
said
this
is
nine
mile
point
later
he
said
this
is
twelve
mile
point
they
were
all
about
level
with
the
water's
edge
they
all
looked
about
alike
to
me
they
were
monotonously
unpicturesque
i
hoped
mr
bixby
would
change
the
subject
but
no
he
would
crowd
up
around
a
point
hugging
the
shore
with
affection
and
then
say
the
slack
water
ends
here
abreast
this
bunch
of
china
trees
now
we
cross
over
so
he
crossed
over
he
gave
me
the
wheel
once
or
twice
but
i
had
no
luck
i
either
came
near
chipping
off
the
edge
of
a
sugar
plantation
or
i
yawed
too
far
from
shore
and
so
dropped
back
into
disgrace
again
and
got
abused
the
watch
was
ended
at
last
and
we
took
supper
and
went
to
bed
at
midnight
the
glare
of
a
lantern
shone
in
my
eyes
and
the
night
watchman
said
come
turn
out
and
then
he
left
i
could
not
understand
this
extraordinary
procedure
so
i
presently
gave
up
trying
to
and
dozed
off
to
sleep
pretty
soon
the
watchman
was
back
again
and
this
time
he
was
gruff
i
was
annoyed
i
said
what
do
you
want
to
come
bothering
around
here
in
the
middle
of
the
night
for
now
as
like
as
not
i'll
not
get
to
sleep
again
to
night
the
watchman
said
well
if
this
an't
good
i'm
blest
the
off
watch
was
just
turning
in
and
i
heard
some
brutal
laughter
from
them
and
such
remarks
as
hello
watchman
an't
the
new
cub
turned
out
yet
he's
delicate
likely
give
him
some
sugar
in
a
rag
and
send
for
the
chambermaid
to
sing
rock
a
by
baby
to
him
about
this
time
mr
bixby
appeared
on
the
scene
something
like
a
minute
later
i
was
climbing
the
pilot
house
steps
with
some
of
my
clothes
on
and
the
rest
in
my
arms
mr
bixby
was
close
behind
commenting
here
was
something
fresh
this
thing
of
getting
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
go
to
work
it
was
a
detail
in
piloting
that
had
never
occurred
to
me
at
all
i
knew
that
boats
ran
all
night
but
somehow
i
had
never
happened
to
reflect
that
somebody
had
to
get
up
out
of
a
warm
bed
to
run
them
i
began
to
fear
that
piloting
was
not
quite
so
romantic
as
i
had
imagined
it
was
there
was
something
very
real
and
work
like
about
this
new
phase
of
it
it
was
a
rather
dingy
night
although
a
fair
number
of
stars
were
out
the
big
mate
was
at
the
wheel
and
he
had
the
old
tub
pointed
at
a
star
and
was
holding
her
straight
up
the
middle
of
the
river
the
shores
on
either
hand
were
not
much
more
than
half
a
mile
apart
but
they
seemed
wonderfully
far
away
and
ever
so
vague
and
indistinct
the
mate
said
we've
got
to
land
at
jones's
plantation
sir
the
vengeful
spirit
in
me
exulted
i
said
to
myself
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
job
mr
bixby
you'll
have
a
good
time
finding
mr
jones's
plantation
such
a
night
as
this
and
i
hope
you
never
will
find
it
as
long
as
you
live
mr
bixby
said
to
the
mate
upper
end
of
the
plantation
or
the
lower
upper
i
can't
do
it
the
stumps
there
are
out
of
water
at
this
stage
it's
no
great
distance
to
the
lower
and
you'll
have
to
get
along
with
that
all
right
sir
if
jones
don't
like
it
he'll
have
to
lump
it
i
reckon
and
then
the
mate
left
my
exultation
began
to
cool
and
my
wonder
to
come
up
here
was
a
man
who
not
only
proposed
to
find
this
plantation
on
such
a
night
but
to
find
either
end
of
it
you
preferred
i
dreadfully
wanted
to
ask
a
question
but
i
was
carrying
about
as
many
short
answers
as
my
cargo
room
would
admit
of
so
i
held
my
peace
all
i
desired
to
ask
mr
bixby
was
the
simple
question
whether
he
was
ass
enough
to
really
imagine
he
was
going
to
find
that
plantation
on
a
night
when
all
plantations
were
exactly
alike
and
all
the
same
color
but
i
held
in
i
used
to
have
fine
inspirations
of
prudence
in
those
days
mr
bixby
made
for
the
shore
and
soon
was
scraping
it
just
the
same
as
if
it
had
been
daylight
and
not
only
that
but
singing
father
in
heaven
the
day
is
declining
etc
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
put
my
life
in
the
keeping
of
a
peculiarly
reckless
outcast
presently
he
turned
on
me
and
said
what's
the
name
of
the
first
point
above
new
orleans
i
was
gratified
to
be
able
to
answer
promptly
and
i
did
i
said
i
didn't
know
don't
know
this
manner
jolted
me
i
was
down
at
the
foot
again
in
a
moment
but
i
had
to
say
just
what
i
had
said
before
well
you're
a
smart
one
said
mr
bixby
what's
the
name
of
the
next
point
once
more
i
didn't
know
well
this
beats
anything
tell
me
the
name
of
any
point
or
place
i
told
you
i
studied
a
while
and
decided
that
i
couldn't
look
here
what
do
you
start
out
from
above
twelve
mile
point
to
cross
over
i
i
don't
know
you
you
don't
know
mimicking
my
drawling
manner
of
speech
what
do
you
know
i
i
nothing
for
certain
by
the
great
caesar's
ghost
i
believe
you
you're
the
stupidest
dunderhead
i
ever
saw
or
ever
heard
of
so
help
me
moses
the
idea
of
you
being
a
pilot
you
why
you
don't
know
enough
to
pilot
a
cow
down
a
lane
oh
but
his
wrath
was
up
he
was
a
nervous
man
and
he
shuffled
from
one
side
of
his
wheel
to
the
other
as
if
the
floor
was
hot
he
would
boil
a
while
to
himself
and
then
overflow
and
scald
me
again
look
here
what
do
you
suppose
i
told
you
the
names
of
those
points
for
i
tremblingly
considered
a
moment
and
then
the
devil
of
temptation
provoked
me
to
say
well
to
to
be
entertaining
i
thought
this
was
a
red
rag
to
the
bull
he
raged
and
stormed
so
he
was
crossing
the
river
at
the
time
that
i
judge
it
made
him
blind
because
he
ran
over
the
steering
oar
of
a
trading
scow
of
course
the
traders
sent
up
a
volley
of
red
hot
profanity
never
was
a
man
so
grateful
as
mr
bixby
was
because
he
was
brim
full
and
here
were
subjects
who
would
talk
back
he
threw
open
a
window
thrust
his
head
out
and
such
an
irruption
followed
as
i
never
had
heard
before
the
fainter
and
farther
away
the
scowmen's
curses
drifted
the
higher
mr
bixby
lifted
his
voice
and
the
weightier
his
adjectives
grew
when
he
closed
the
window
he
was
empty
you
could
have
drawn
a
seine
through
his
system
and
not
caught
curses
enough
to
disturb
your
mother
with
presently
he
said
to
me
in
the
gentlest
way
my
boy
you
must
get
a
little
memorandum
book
and
every
time
i
tell
you
a
thing
put
it
down
right
away
there's
only
one
way
to
be
a
pilot
and
that
is
to
get
this
entire
river
by
heart
you
have
to
know
it
just
like
a
b
c
that
was
a
dismal
revelation
to
me
for
my
memory
was
never
loaded
with
anything
but
blank
cartridges
however
i
did
not
feel
discouraged
long
i
judged
that
it
was
best
to
make
some
allowances
for
doubtless
mr
bixby
was
stretching
presently
he
pulled
a
rope
and
struck
a
few
strokes
on
the
big
bell
the
stars
were
all
gone
now
and
the
night
was
as
black
as
ink
i
could
hear
the
wheels
churn
along
the
bank
but
i
was
not
entirely
certain
that
i
could
see
the
shore
the
voice
of
the
invisible
watchman
called
up
from
the
hurricane
deck
what's
this
sir
jones's
plantation
i
said
to
myself
i
wish
i
might
venture
to
offer
a
small
bet
that
it
isn't
but
i
did
not
chirp
i
only
waited
to
see
mr
bixby
handled
the
engine
bells
and
in
due
time
the
boat's
nose
came
to
the
land
a
torch
glowed
from
the
forecastle
a
man
skipped
ashore
a
darky's
voice
on
the
bank
said
gimme
de
k'yarpet
bag
mars
jones
and
the
next
moment
we
were
standing
up
the
river
again
all
serene
i
reflected
deeply
awhile
and
then
said
but
not
aloud
well
the
finding
of
that
plantation
was
the
luckiest
accident
that
ever
happened
but
it
couldn't
happen
again
in
a
hundred
years
and
i
fully
believed
it
was
an
accident
too
by
the
time
we
had
gone
seven
or
eight
hundred
miles
up
the
river
i
had
learned
to
be
a
tolerably
plucky
up
stream
steersman
in
daylight
and
before
we
reached
st
louis
i
had
made
a
trifle
of
progress
in
night
work
but
only
a
trifle
i
had
a
note
book
that
fairly
bristled
with
the
names
of
towns
points
bars
islands
bends
reaches
etc
but
the
information
was
to
be
found
only
in
the
notebook
none
of
it
was
in
my
head
it
made
my
heart
ache
to
think
i
had
only
got
half
of
the
river
set
down
for
as
our
watch
was
four
hours
off
and
four
hours
on
day
and
night
there
was
a
long
four
hour
gap
in
my
book
for
every
time
i
had
slept
since
the
voyage
began
my
chief
was
presently
hired
to
go
on
a
big
new
orleans
boat
and
i
packed
my
satchel
and
went
with
him
she
was
a
grand
affair
when
i
stood
in
her
pilot
house
i
was
so
far
above
the
water
that
i
seemed
perched
on
a
mountain
and
her
decks
stretched
so
far
away
fore
and
aft
below
me
that
i
wondered
how
i
could
ever
have
considered
the
little
paul
jones
a
large
craft
there
were
other
differences
too
the
paul
jones's
pilot
house
was
a
cheap
dingy
battered
rattle
trap
cramped
for
room
but
here
was
a
sumptuous
glass
temple
room
enough
to
have
a
dance
in
showy
red
and
gold
window
curtains
an
imposing
sofa
leather
cushions
and
a
back
to
the
high
bench
where
visiting
pilots
sit
to
spin
yarns
and
look
at
the
river
bright
fanciful
cuspadores
instead
of
a
broad
wooden
box
filled
with
sawdust
nice
new
oil
cloth
on
the
floor
a
hospitable
big
stove
for
winter
a
wheel
as
high
as
my
head
costly
with
inlaid
work
a
wire
tiller
rope
bright
brass
knobs
for
the
bells
and
a
tidy
white
aproned
black
texas
tender
to
bring
up
tarts
and
ices
and
coffee
during
mid
watch
day
and
night
now
this
was
something
like
and
so
i
began
to
take
heart
once
more
to
believe
that
piloting
was
a
romantic
sort
of
occupation
after
all
the
moment
we
were
under
way
i
began
to
prowl
about
the
great
steamer
and
fill
myself
with
joy
she
was
as
clean
and
as
dainty
as
a
drawing
room
when
i
looked
down
her
long
gilded
saloon
it
was
like
gazing
through
a
splendid
tunnel
she
had
an
oil
picture
by
some
gifted
sign
painter
on
every
stateroom
door
she
glittered
with
no
end
of
prism
fringed
chandeliers
the
clerk's
office
was
elegant
the
bar
was
marvelous
and
the
bar
keeper
had
been
barbered
and
upholstered
at
incredible
cost
the
boiler
deck
i
e
the
second
story
of
the
boat
so
to
speak
was
as
spacious
as
a
church
it
seemed
to
me
so
with
the
forecastle
and
there
was
no
pitiful
handful
of
deckhands
firemen
and
roustabouts
down
there
but
a
whole
battalion
of
men
the
fires
were
fiercely
glaring
from
a
long
row
of
furnaces
and
over
them
were
eight
huge
boilers
this
was
unutterable
pomp
the
mighty
engines
but
enough
of
this
i
had
never
felt
so
fine
before
and
when
i
found
that
the
regiment
of
natty
servants
respectfully
sir'd
me
my
satisfaction
was
complete
chapter
a
daring
deed
when
i
returned
to
the
pilot
house
st
louis
was
gone
and
i
was
lost
here
was
a
piece
of
river
which
was
all
down
in
my
book
but
i
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
it
you
understand
it
was
turned
around
i
had
seen
it
when
coming
up
stream
but
i
had
never
faced
about
to
see
how
it
looked
when
it
was
behind
me
my
heart
broke
again
for
it
was
plain
that
i
had
got
to
learn
this
troublesome
river
both
ways
the
pilot
house
was
full
of
pilots
going
down
to
look
at
the
river
what
is
called
the
upper
river
the
two
hundred
miles
between
st
louis
and
cairo
where
the
ohio
comes
in
was
low
and
the
mississippi
changes
its
channel
so
constantly
that
the
pilots
used
to
always
find
it
necessary
to
run
down
to
cairo
to
take
a
fresh
look
when
their
boats
were
to
lie
in
port
a
week
that
is
when
the
water
was
at
a
low
stage
a
deal
of
this
looking
at
the
river
was
done
by
poor
fellows
who
seldom
had
a
berth
and
whose
only
hope
of
getting
one
lay
in
their
being
always
freshly
posted
and
therefore
ready
to
drop
into
the
shoes
of
some
reputable
pilot
for
a
single
trip
on
account
of
such
pilot's
sudden
illness
or
some
other
necessity
and
a
good
many
of
them
constantly
ran
up
and
down
inspecting
the
river
not
because
they
ever
really
hoped
to
get
a
berth
but
because
they
being
guests
of
the
boat
it
was
cheaper
to
look
at
the
river
than
stay
ashore
and
pay
board
in
time
these
fellows
grew
dainty
in
their
tastes
and
only
infested
boats
that
had
an
established
reputation
for
setting
good
tables
all
visiting
pilots
were
useful
for
they
were
always
ready
and
willing
winter
or
summer
night
or
day
to
go
out
in
the
yawl
and
help
buoy
the
channel
or
assist
the
boat's
pilots
in
any
way
they
could
they
were
likewise
welcome
because
all
pilots
are
tireless
talkers
when
gathered
together
and
as
they
talk
only
about
the
river
they
are
always
understood
and
are
always
interesting
your
true
pilot
cares
nothing
about
anything
on
earth
but
the
river
and
his
pride
in
his
occupation
surpasses
the
pride
of
kings
we
had
a
fine
company
of
these
river
inspectors
along
this
trip
there
were
eight
or
ten
and
there
was
abundance
of
room
for
them
in
our
great
pilot
house
two
or
three
of
them
wore
polished
silk
hats
elaborate
shirt
fronts
diamond
breast
pins
kid
gloves
and
patent
leather
boots
they
were
choice
in
their
english
and
bore
themselves
with
a
dignity
proper
to
men
of
solid
means
and
prodigious
reputation
as
pilots
the
others
were
more
or
less
loosely
clad
and
wore
upon
their
heads
tall
felt
cones
that
were
suggestive
of
the
days
of
the
commonwealth
i
was
a
cipher
in
this
august
company
and
felt
subdued
not
to
say
torpid
i
was
not
even
of
sufficient
consequence
to
assist
at
the
wheel
when
it
was
necessary
to
put
the
tiller
hard
down
in
a
hurry
the
guest
that
stood
nearest
did
that
when
occasion
required
and
this
was
pretty
much
all
the
time
because
of
the
crookedness
of
the
channel
and
the
scant
water
i
stood
in
a
corner
and
the
talk
i
listened
to
took
the
hope
all
out
of
me
one
visitor
said
to
another
jim
how
did
you
run
plum
point
coming
up
it
was
in
the
night
there
and
i
ran
it
the
way
one
of
the
boys
on
the
diana
told
me
started
out
about
fifty
yards
above
the
wood
pile
on
the
false
point
and
held
on
the
cabin
under
plum
point
till
i
raised
the
reef
quarter
less
twain
then
straightened
up
for
the
middle
bar
till
i
got
well
abreast
the
old
one
limbed
cotton
wood
in
the
bend
then
got
my
stern
on
the
cotton
wood
and
head
on
the
low
place
above
the
point
and
came
through
a
booming
nine
and
a
half
pretty
square
crossing
an't
it
yes
but
the
upper
bar
s
working
down
fast
another
pilot
spoke
up
and
said
i
had
better
water
than
that
and
ran
it
lower
down
started
out
from
the
false
point
mark
twain
raised
the
second
reef
abreast
the
big
snag
in
the
bend
and
had
quarter
less
twain
one
of
the
gorgeous
ones
remarked
i
don't
want
to
find
fault
with
your
leadsmen
but
that's
a
good
deal
of
water
for
plum
point
it
seems
to
me
there
was
an
approving
nod
all
around
as
this
quiet
snub
dropped
on
the
boaster
and
settled
him
and
so
they
went
on
talk
talk
talking
meantime
the
thing
that
was
running
in
my
mind
was
now
if
my
ears
hear
aright
i
have
not
only
to
get
the
names
of
all
the
towns
and
islands
and
bends
and
so
on
by
heart
but
i
must
even
get
up
a
warm
personal
acquaintanceship
with
every
old
snag
and
one
limbed
cotton
wood
and
obscure
wood
pile
that
ornaments
the
banks
of
this
river
for
twelve
hundred
miles
and
more
than
that
i
must
actually
know
where
these
things
are
in
the
dark
unless
these
guests
are
gifted
with
eyes
that
can
pierce
through
two
miles
of
solid
blackness
i
wish
the
piloting
business
was
in
jericho
and
i
had
never
thought
of
it
at
dusk
mr
bixby
tapped
the
big
bell
three
times
the
signal
to
land
and
the
captain
emerged
from
his
drawing
room
in
the
forward
end
of
the
texas
and
looked
up
inquiringly
mr
bixby
said
we
will
lay
up
here
all
night
captain
very
well
sir
that
was
all
the
boat
came
to
shore
and
was
tied
up
for
the
night
it
seemed
to
me
a
fine
thing
that
the
pilot
could
do
as
he
pleased
without
asking
so
grand
a
captain's
permission
i
took
my
supper
and
went
immediately
to
bed
discouraged
by
my
day's
observations
and
experiences
my
late
voyage's
note
booking
was
but
a
confusion
of
meaningless
names
it
had
tangled
me
all
up
in
a
knot
every
time
i
had
looked
at
it
in
the
daytime
i
now
hoped
for
respite
in
sleep
but
no
it
reveled
all
through
my
head
till
sunrise
again
a
frantic
and
tireless
nightmare
next
morning
i
felt
pretty
rusty
and
low
spirited
we
went
booming
along
taking
a
good
many
chances
for
we
were
anxious
to
get
out
of
the
river
as
getting
out
to
cairo
was
called
before
night
should
overtake
us
but
mr
bixby's
partner
the
other
pilot
presently
grounded
the
boat
and
we
lost
so
much
time
in
getting
her
off
that
it
was
plain
that
darkness
would
overtake
us
a
good
long
way
above
the
mouth
this
was
a
great
misfortune
especially
to
certain
of
our
visiting
pilots
whose
boats
would
have
to
wait
for
their
return
no
matter
how
long
that
might
be
it
sobered
the
pilot
house
talk
a
good
deal
coming
up
stream
pilots
did
not
mind
low
water
or
any
kind
of
darkness
nothing
stopped
them
but
fog
but
down
stream
work
was
different
a
boat
was
too
nearly
helpless
with
a
stiff
current
pushing
behind
her
so
it
was
not
customary
to
run
down
stream
at
night
in
low
water
there
seemed
to
be
one
small
hope
however
if
we
could
get
through
the
intricate
and
dangerous
hat
island
crossing
before
night
we
could
venture
the
rest
for
we
would
have
plainer
sailing
and
better
water
but
it
would
be
insanity
to
attempt
hat
island
at
night
so
there
was
a
deal
of
looking
at
watches
all
the
rest
of
the
day
and
a
constant
ciphering
upon
the
speed
we
were
making
hat
island
was
the
eternal
subject
sometimes
hope
was
high
and
sometimes
we
were
delayed
in
a
bad
crossing
and
down
it
went
again
for
hours
all
hands
lay
under
the
burden
of
this
suppressed
excitement
it
was
even
communicated
to
me
and
i
got
to
feeling
so
solicitous
about
hat
island
and
under
such
an
awful
pressure
of
responsibility
that
i
wished
i
might
have
five
minutes
on
shore
to
draw
a
good
full
relieving
breath
and
start
over
again
we
were
standing
no
regular
watches
each
of
our
pilots
ran
such
portions
of
the
river
as
he
had
run
when
coming
up
stream
because
of
his
greater
familiarity
with
it
but
both
remained
in
the
pilot
house
constantly
an
hour
before
sunset
mr
bixby
took
the
wheel
and
mr
w
stepped
aside
for
the
next
thirty
minutes
every
man
held
his
watch
in
his
hand
and
was
restless
silent
and
uneasy
at
last
somebody
said
with
a
doomful
sigh
well
yonder's
hat
island
and
we
can't
make
it
all
the
watches
closed
with
a
snap
everybody
sighed
and
muttered
something
about
its
being
too
bad
too
bad
ah
if
we
could
only
have
got
here
half
an
hour
sooner
and
the
place
was
thick
with
the
atmosphere
of
disappointment
some
started
to
go
out
but
loitered
hearing
no
bell
tap
to
land
the
sun
dipped
behind
the
horizon
the
boat
went
on
inquiring
looks
passed
from
one
guest
to
another
and
one
who
had
his
hand
on
the
door
knob
and
had
turned
it
waited
then
presently
took
away
his
hand
and
let
the
knob
turn
back
again
we
bore
steadily
down
the
bend
more
looks
were
exchanged
and
nods
of
surprised
admiration
but
no
words
insensibly
the
men
drew
together
behind
mr
bixby
as
the
sky
darkened
and
one
or
two
dim
stars
came
out
the
dead
silence
and
sense
of
waiting
became
oppressive
mr
bixby
pulled
the
cord
and
two
deep
mellow
notes
from
the
big
bell
floated
off
on
the
night
then
a
pause
and
one
more
note
was
struck
the
watchman's
voice
followed
from
the
hurricane
deck
labboard
lead
there
stabboard
lead
the
cries
of
the
leadsmen
began
to
rise
out
of
the
distance
and
were
gruffly
repeated
by
the
word
passers
on
the
hurricane
deck
m
a
r
k
three
m
a
r
k
three
quarter
less
three
half
twain
quarter

m
a
r
k

quarter
less
mr
bixby
pulled
two
bell
ropes
and
was
answered
by
faint
jinglings
far
below
in
the
engine
room
and
our
speed
slackened
the
steam
began
to
whistle
through
the
gauge
cocks
the
cries
of
the
leadsmen
went
on
and
it
is
a
weird
sound
always
in
the
night
every
pilot
in
the
lot
was
watching
now
with
fixed
eyes
and
talking
under
his
breath
nobody
was
calm
and
easy
but
mr
bixby
he
would
put
his
wheel
down
and
stand
on
a
spoke
and
as
the
steamer
swung
into
her
to
me
utterly
invisible
marks
for
we
seemed
to
be
in
the
midst
of
a
wide
and
gloomy
sea
he
would
meet
and
fasten
her
there
out
of
the
murmur
of
half
audible
talk
one
caught
a
coherent
sentence
now
and
then
such
as
there
she's
over
the
first
reef
all
right
after
a
pause
another
subdued
voice
her
stern's
coming
down
just
exactly
right
by
george
now
she's
in
the
marks
over
she
goes
somebody
else
muttered
oh
it
was
done
beautiful
beautiful
now
the
engines
were
stopped
altogether
and
we
drifted
with
the
current
not
that
i
could
see
the
boat
drift
for
i
could
not
the
stars
being
all
gone
by
this
time
this
drifting
was
the
dismalest
work
it
held
one's
heart
still
presently
i
discovered
a
blacker
gloom
than
that
which
surrounded
us
it
was
the
head
of
the
island
we
were
closing
right
down
upon
it
we
entered
its
deeper
shadow
and
so
imminent
seemed
the
peril
that
i
was
likely
to
suffocate
and
i
had
the
strongest
impulse
to
do
something
anything
to
save
the
vessel
but
still
mr
bixby
stood
by
his
wheel
silent
intent
as
a
cat
and
all
the
pilots
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
at
his
back
she'll
not
make
it
somebody
whispered
the
water
grew
shoaler
and
shoaler
by
the
leadsman's
cries
till
it
was
down
to
eight
and
a
half
e
i
g
h
t
feet
e
i
g
h
t
feet
seven
and
mr
bixby
said
warningly
through
his
speaking
tube
to
the
engineer
stand
by
now
aye
aye
sir
seven
and
a
half
seven
feet
six
and
we
touched
bottom
instantly
mr
bixby
set
a
lot
of
bells
ringing
shouted
through
the
tube
now
let
her
have
it
every
ounce
you've
got
then
to
his
partner
put
her
hard
down
snatch
her
snatch
her
the
boat
rasped
and
ground
her
way
through
the
sand
hung
upon
the
apex
of
disaster
a
single
tremendous
instant
and
then
over
she
went
and
such
a
shout
as
went
up
at
mr
bixby's
back
never
loosened
the
roof
of
a
pilot
house
before
there
was
no
more
trouble
after
that
mr
bixby
was
a
hero
that
night
and
it
was
some
little
time
too
before
his
exploit
ceased
to
be
talked
about
by
river
men
fully
to
realize
the
marvelous
precision
required
in
laying
the
great
steamer
in
her
marks
in
that
murky
waste
of
water
one
should
know
that
not
only
must
she
pick
her
intricate
way
through
snags
and
blind
reefs
and
then
shave
the
head
of
the
island
so
closely
as
to
brush
the
overhanging
foliage
with
her
stern
but
at
one
place
she
must
pass
almost
within
arm's
reach
of
a
sunken
and
invisible
wreck
that
would
snatch
the
hull
timbers
from
under
her
if
she
should
strike
it
and
destroy
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollars
worth
of
steam
boat
and
cargo
in
five
minutes
and
maybe
a
hundred
and
fifty
human
lives
into
the
bargain
the
last
remark
i
heard
that
night
was
a
compliment
to
mr
bixby
uttered
in
soliloquy
and
with
unction
by
one
of
our
guests
he
said
by
the
shadow
of
death
but
he's
a
lightning
pilot
chapter
perplexing
lessons
at
the
end
of
what
seemed
a
tedious
while
i
had
managed
to
pack
my
head
full
of
islands
towns
bars
points
and
bends
and
a
curiously
inanimate
mass
of
lumber
it
was
too
however
inasmuch
as
i
could
shut
my
eyes
and
reel
off
a
good
long
string
of
these
names
without
leaving
out
more
than
ten
miles
of
river
in
every
fifty
i
began
to
feel
that
i
could
take
a
boat
down
to
new
orleans
if
i
could
make
her
skip
those
little
gaps
but
of
course
my
complacency
could
hardly
get
start
enough
to
lift
my
nose
a
trifle
into
the
air
before
mr
bixby
would
think
of
something
to
fetch
it
down
again
one
day
he
turned
on
me
suddenly
with
this
settler
what
is
the
shape
of
walnut
bend
he
might
as
well
have
asked
me
my
grandmother's
opinion
of
protoplasm
i
reflected
respectfully
and
then
said
i
didn't
know
it
had
any
particular
shape
my
gunpowdery
chief
went
off
with
a
bang
of
course
and
then
went
on
loading
and
firing
until
he
was
out
of
adjectives
i
had
learned
long
ago
that
he
only
carried
just
so
many
rounds
of
ammunition
and
was
sure
to
subside
into
a
very
placable
and
even
remorseful
old
smooth
bore
as
soon
as
they
were
all
gone
that
word
old
is
merely
affectionate
he
was
not
more
than
thirty
four
i
waited
by
and
by
he
said
my
boy
you've
got
to
know
the
shape
of
the
river
perfectly
it
is
all
there
is
left
to
steer
by
on
a
very
dark
night
everything
else
is
blotted
out
and
gone
but
mind
you
it
hasn't
the
same
shape
in
the
night
that
it
has
in
the
day
time
how
on
earth
am
i
ever
going
to
learn
it
then
how
do
you
follow
a
hall
at
home
in
the
dark
because
you
know
the
shape
of
it
you
can't
see
it
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i've
got
to
know
all
the
million
trifling
variations
of
shape
in
the
banks
of
this
interminable
river
as
well
as
i
know
the
shape
of
the
front
hall
at
home
on
my
honor
you've
got
to
know
them
better
than
any
man
ever
did
know
the
shapes
of
the
halls
in
his
own
house
i
wish
i
was
dead
now
i
don't
want
to
discourage
you
but
well
pile
it
on
me
i
might
as
well
have
it
now
as
another
time
you
see
this
has
got
to
be
learned
there
isn't
any
getting
around
it
a
clear
starlight
night
throws
such
heavy
shadows
that
if
you
didn't
know
the
shape
of
a
shore
perfectly
you
would
claw
away
from
every
bunch
of
timber
because
you
would
take
the
black
shadow
of
it
for
a
solid
cape
and
you
see
you
would
be
getting
scared
to
death
every
fifteen
minutes
by
the
watch
you
would
be
fifty
yards
from
shore
all
the
time
when
you
ought
to
be
within
fifty
feet
of
it
you
can't
see
a
snag
in
one
of
those
shadows
but
you
know
exactly
where
it
is
and
the
shape
of
the
river
tells
you
when
you
are
coming
to
it
then
there's
your
pitch
dark
night
the
river
is
a
very
different
shape
on
a
pitch
dark
night
from
what
it
is
on
a
starlight
night
all
shores
seem
to
be
straight
lines
then
and
mighty
dim
ones
too
and
you'd
run
them
for
straight
lines
only
you
know
better
you
boldly
drive
your
boat
right
into
what
seems
to
be
a
solid
straight
wall
you
knowing
very
well
that
in
reality
there
is
a
curve
there
and
that
wall
falls
back
and
makes
way
for
you
then
there's
your
gray
mist
you
take
a
night
when
there's
one
of
these
grisly
drizzly
gray
mists
and
then
there
isn't
any
particular
shape
to
a
shore
a
gray
mist
would
tangle
the
head
of
the
oldest
man
that
ever
lived
well
then
different
kinds
of
moonlight
change
the
shape
of
the
river
in
different
ways
you
see
oh
don't
say
any
more
please
have
i
got
to
learn
the
shape
of
the
river
according
to
all
these
five
hundred
thousand
different
ways
if
i
tried
to
carry
all
that
cargo
in
my
head
it
would
make
me
stoop
shouldered
no
you
only
learn
the
shape
of
the
river
and
you
learn
it
with
such
absolute
certainty
that
you
can
always
steer
by
the
shape
that's
in
your
head
and
never
mind
the
one
that's
before
your
eyes
very
well
i'll
try
it
but
after
i
have
learned
it
can
i
depend
on
it
will
it
keep
the
same
form
and
not
go
fooling
around
before
mr
bixby
could
answer
mr
w
came
in
to
take
the
watch
and
he
said
bixby
you'll
have
to
look
out
for
president's
island
and
all
that
country
clear
away
up
above
the
old
hen
and
chickens
the
banks
are
caving
and
the
shape
of
the
shores
changing
like
everything
why
you
wouldn't
know
the
point
above
you
can
go
up
inside
the
old
sycamore
snag
now
footnote
it
may
not
be
necessary
but
still
it
can
do
no
harm
to
explain
that
inside
means
between
the
snag
and
the
shore
m
t
so
that
question
was
answered
here
were
leagues
of
shore
changing
shape
my
spirits
were
down
in
the
mud
again
two
things
seemed
pretty
apparent
to
me
one
was
that
in
order
to
be
a
pilot
a
man
had
got
to
learn
more
than
any
one
man
ought
to
be
allowed
to
know
and
the
other
was
that
he
must
learn
it
all
over
again
in
a
different
way
every
twenty
four
hours
that
night
we
had
the
watch
until
twelve
now
it
was
an
ancient
river
custom
for
the
two
pilots
to
chat
a
bit
when
the
watch
changed
while
the
relieving
pilot
put
on
his
gloves
and
lit
his
cigar
his
partner
the
retiring
pilot
would
say
something
like
this
i
judge
the
upper
bar
is
making
down
a
little
at
hale's
point
had
quarter
twain
with
the
lower
lead
and
mark
twain
footnote
fathoms
quarter
twain
is
two
and
a
quarter
fathoms
thirteen
and
a
half
feet
mark
three
is
three
fathoms
with
the
other
yes
i
thought
it
was
making
down
a
little
last
trip
meet
any
boats
met
one
abreast
the
head
of
but
she
was
away
over
hugging
the
bar
and
i
couldn't
make
her
out
entirely
i
took
her
for
the
sunny
south
hadn't
any
skylights
forward
of
the
chimneys
and
so
on
and
as
the
relieving
pilot
took
the
wheel
his
partner
footnote
is
a
technical
term
for
the
other
pilot
would
mention
that
we
were
in
such
and
such
a
bend
and
say
we
were
abreast
of
such
and
such
a
man's
wood
yard
or
plantation
this
was
courtesy
i
supposed
it
was
necessity
but
mr
w
came
on
watch
full
twelve
minutes
late
on
this
particular
night
a
tremendous
breach
of
etiquette
in
fact
it
is
the
unpardonable
sin
among
pilots
so
mr
bixby
gave
him
no
greeting
whatever
but
simply
surrendered
the
wheel
and
marched
out
of
the
pilot
house
without
a
word
i
was
appalled
it
was
a
villainous
night
for
blackness
we
were
in
a
particularly
wide
and
blind
part
of
the
river
where
there
was
no
shape
or
substance
to
anything
and
it
seemed
incredible
that
mr
bixby
should
have
left
that
poor
fellow
to
kill
the
boat
trying
to
find
out
where
he
was
but
i
resolved
that
i
would
stand
by
him
any
way
he
should
find
that
he
was
not
wholly
friendless
so
i
stood
around
and
waited
to
be
asked
where
we
were
but
mr
w
plunged
on
serenely
through
the
solid
firmament
of
black
cats
that
stood
for
an
atmosphere
and
never
opened
his
mouth
here
is
a
proud
devil
thought
i
here
is
a
limb
of
satan
that
would
rather
send
us
all
to
destruction
than
put
himself
under
obligations
to
me
because
i
am
not
yet
one
of
the
salt
of
the
earth
and
privileged
to
snub
captains
and
lord
it
over
everything
dead
and
alive
in
a
steamboat
i
presently
climbed
up
on
the
bench
i
did
not
think
it
was
safe
to
go
to
sleep
while
this
lunatic
was
on
watch
however
i
must
have
gone
to
sleep
in
the
course
of
time
because
the
next
thing
i
was
aware
of
was
the
fact
that
day
was
breaking
mr
w
gone
and
mr
bixby
at
the
wheel
again
so
it
was
four
o'clock
and
all
well
but
me
i
felt
like
a
skinful
of
dry
bones
and
all
of
them
trying
to
ache
at
once
mr
bixby
asked
me
what
i
had
stayed
up
there
for
i
confessed
that
it
was
to
do
mr
w
a
benevolence
tell
him
where
he
was
it
took
five
minutes
for
the
entire
preposterousness
of
the
thing
to
filter
into
mr
bixby's
system
and
then
i
judge
it
filled
him
nearly
up
to
the
chin
because
he
paid
me
a
compliment
and
not
much
of
a
one
either
he
said
well
taking
you
by
and
large
you
do
seem
to
be
more
different
kinds
of
an
ass
than
any
creature
i
ever
saw
before
what
did
you
suppose
he
wanted
to
know
for
i
said
i
thought
it
might
be
a
convenience
to
him
convenience
d
nation
didn't
i
tell
you
that
a
man's
got
to
know
the
river
in
the
night
the
same
as
he'd
know
his
own
front
hall
well
i
can
follow
the
front
hall
in
the
dark
if
i
know
it
is
the
front
hall
but
suppose
you
set
me
down
in
the
middle
of
it
in
the
dark
and
not
tell
me
which
hall
it
is
how
am
i
to
know
well
you've
got
to
on
the
river
all
right
then
i'm
glad
i
never
said
anything
to
mr
w
i
should
say
so
why
he'd
have
slammed
you
through
the
window
and
utterly
ruined
a
hundred
dollars
worth
of
window
sash
and
stuff
i
was
glad
this
damage
had
been
saved
for
it
would
have
made
me
unpopular
with
the
owners
they
always
hated
anybody
who
had
the
name
of
being
careless
and
injuring
things
i
went
to
work
now
to
learn
the
shape
of
the
river
and
of
all
the
eluding
and
ungraspable
objects
that
ever
i
tried
to
get
mind
or
hands
on
that
was
the
chief
i
would
fasten
my
eyes
upon
a
sharp
wooded
point
that
projected
far
into
the
river
some
miles
ahead
of
me
and
go
to
laboriously
photographing
its
shape
upon
my
brain
and
just
as
i
was
beginning
to
succeed
to
my
satisfaction
we
would
draw
up
toward
it
and
the
exasperating
thing
would
begin
to
melt
away
and
fold
back
into
the
bank
if
there
had
been
a
conspicuous
dead
tree
standing
upon
the
very
point
of
the
cape
i
would
find
that
tree
inconspicuously
merged
into
the
general
forest
and
occupying
the
middle
of
a
straight
shore
when
i
got
abreast
of
it
no
prominent
hill
would
stick
to
its
shape
long
enough
for
me
to
make
up
my
mind
what
its
form
really
was
but
it
was
as
dissolving
and
changeful
as
if
it
had
been
a
mountain
of
butter
in
the
hottest
corner
of
the
tropics
nothing
ever
had
the
same
shape
when
i
was
coming
downstream
that
it
had
borne
when
i
went
up
i
mentioned
these
little
difficulties
to
mr
bixby
he
said
that's
the
very
main
virtue
of
the
thing
if
the
shapes
didn't
change
every
three
seconds
they
wouldn't
be
of
any
use
take
this
place
where
we
are
now
for
instance
as
long
as
that
hill
over
yonder
is
only
one
hill
i
can
boom
right
along
the
way
i'm
going
but
the
moment
it
splits
at
the
top
and
forms
a
v
i
know
i've
got
to
scratch
to
starboard
in
a
hurry
or
i'll
bang
this
boat's
brains
out
against
a
rock
and
then
the
moment
one
of
the
prongs
of
the
v
swings
behind
the
other
i've
got
to
waltz
to
larboard
again
or
i'll
have
a
misunderstanding
with
a
snag
that
would
snatch
the
keelson
out
of
this
steamboat
as
neatly
as
if
it
were
a
sliver
in
your
hand
if
that
hill
didn't
change
its
shape
on
bad
nights
there
would
be
an
awful
steamboat
grave
yard
around
here
inside
of
a
year
it
was
plain
that
i
had
got
to
learn
the
shape
of
the
river
in
all
the
different
ways
that
could
be
thought
of
upside
down
wrong
end
first
inside
out
fore
and
aft
and
thortships
and
then
know
what
to
do
on
gray
nights
when
it
hadn't
any
shape
at
all
so
i
set
about
it
in
the
course
of
time
i
began
to
get
the
best
of
this
knotty
lesson
and
my
self
complacency
moved
to
the
front
once
more
mr
bixby
was
all
fixed
and
ready
to
start
it
to
the
rear
again
he
opened
on
me
after
this
fashion
how
much
water
did
we
have
in
the
middle
crossing
at
hole
in
the
wall
trip
before
last
i
considered
this
an
outrage
i
said
every
trip
down
and
up
the
leadsmen
are
singing
through
that
tangled
place
for
three
quarters
of
an
hour
on
a
stretch
how
do
you
reckon
i
can
remember
such
a
mess
as
that
my
boy
you've
got
to
remember
it
you've
got
to
remember
the
exact
spot
and
the
exact
marks
the
boat
lay
in
when
we
had
the
shoalest
water
in
everyone
of
the
five
hundred
shoal
places
between
st
louis
and
new
orleans
and
you
mustn't
get
the
shoal
soundings
and
marks
of
one
trip
mixed
up
with
the
shoal
soundings
and
marks
of
another
either
for
they're
not
often
twice
alike
you
must
keep
them
separate
when
i
came
to
myself
again
i
said
when
i
get
so
that
i
can
do
that
i'll
be
able
to
raise
the
dead
and
then
i
won't
have
to
pilot
a
steamboat
to
make
a
living
i
want
to
retire
from
this
business
i
want
a
slush
bucket
and
a
brush
i'm
only
fit
for
a
roustabout
i
haven't
got
brains
enough
to
be
a
pilot
and
if
i
had
i
wouldn't
have
strength
enough
to
carry
them
around
unless
i
went
on
crutches
now
drop
that
when
i
say
i'll
learn
footnote
is
not
in
the
river
vocabulary
a
man
the
river
i
mean
it
and
you
can
depend
on
it
i'll
learn
him
or
kill
him
chapter
continued
perplexities
there
was
no
use
in
arguing
with
a
person
like
this
i
promptly
put
such
a
strain
on
my
memory
that
by
and
by
even
the
shoal
water
and
the
countless
crossing
marks
began
to
stay
with
me
but
the
result
was
just
the
same
i
never
could
more
than
get
one
knotty
thing
learned
before
another
presented
itself
now
i
had
often
seen
pilots
gazing
at
the
water
and
pretending
to
read
it
as
if
it
were
a
book
but
it
was
a
book
that
told
me
nothing
a
time
came
at
last
however
when
mr
bixby
seemed
to
think
me
far
enough
advanced
to
bear
a
lesson
on
water
reading
so
he
began
do
you
see
that
long
slanting
line
on
the
face
of
the
water
now
that's
a
reef
moreover
it's
a
bluff
reef
there
is
a
solid
sand
bar
under
it
that
is
nearly
as
straight
up
and
down
as
the
side
of
a
house
there
is
plenty
of
water
close
up
to
it
but
mighty
little
on
top
of
it
if
you
were
to
hit
it
you
would
knock
the
boat's
brains
out
do
you
see
where
the
line
fringes
out
at
the
upper
end
and
begins
to
fade
away
yes
sir
well
that
is
a
low
place
that
is
the
head
of
the
reef
you
can
climb
over
there
and
not
hurt
anything
cross
over
now
and
follow
along
close
under
the
reef
easy
water
there
not
much
current
i
followed
the
reef
along
till
i
approached
the
fringed
end
then
mr
bixby
said
now
get
ready
wait
till
i
give
the
word
she
won't
want
to
mount
the
reef
a
boat
hates
shoal
water
stand
by
wait
wait
keep
her
well
in
hand
now
cramp
her
down
snatch
her
snatch
her
he
seized
the
other
side
of
the
wheel
and
helped
to
spin
it
around
until
it
was
hard
down
and
then
we
held
it
so
the
boat
resisted
and
refused
to
answer
for
a
while
and
next
she
came
surging
to
starboard
mounted
the
reef
and
sent
a
long
angry
ridge
of
water
foaming
away
from
her
bows
now
watch
her
watch
her
like
a
cat
or
she'll
get
away
from
you
when
she
fights
strong
and
the
tiller
slips
a
little
in
a
jerky
greasy
sort
of
way
let
up
on
her
a
trifle
it
is
the
way
she
tells
you
at
night
that
the
water
is
too
shoal
but
keep
edging
her
up
little
by
little
toward
the
point
you
are
well
up
on
the
bar
now
there
is
a
bar
under
every
point
because
the
water
that
comes
down
around
it
forms
an
eddy
and
allows
the
sediment
to
sink
do
you
see
those
fine
lines
on
the
face
of
the
water
that
branch
out
like
the
ribs
of
a
fan
well
those
are
little
reefs
you
want
to
just
miss
the
ends
of
them
but
run
them
pretty
close
now
look
out
look
out
don't
you
crowd
that
slick
greasy
looking
place
there
ain't
nine
feet
there
she
won't
stand
it
she
begins
to
smell
it
look
sharp
i
tell
you
oh
blazes
there
you
go
stop
the
starboard
wheel
quick
ship
up
to
back
set
her
back
the
engine
bells
jingled
and
the
engines
answered
promptly
shooting
white
columns
of
steam
far
aloft
out
of
the
scape
pipes
but
it
was
too
late
the
boat
had
smelt
the
bar
in
good
earnest
the
foamy
ridges
that
radiated
from
her
bows
suddenly
disappeared
a
great
dead
swell
came
rolling
forward
and
swept
ahead
of
her
she
careened
far
over
to
larboard
and
went
tearing
away
toward
the
other
shore
as
if
she
were
about
scared
to
death
we
were
a
good
mile
from
where
we
ought
to
have
been
when
we
finally
got
the
upper
hand
of
her
again
during
the
afternoon
watch
the
next
day
mr
bixby
asked
me
if
i
knew
how
to
run
the
next
few
miles
i
said
go
inside
the
first
snag
above
the
point
outside
the
next
one
start
out
from
the
lower
end
of
higgins's
wood
yard
make
a
square
crossing
and
that's
all
right
i'll
be
back
before
you
close
up
on
the
next
point
but
he
wasn't
he
was
still
below
when
i
rounded
it
and
entered
upon
a
piece
of
river
which
i
had
some
misgivings
about
i
did
not
know
that
he
was
hiding
behind
a
chimney
to
see
how
i
would
perform
i
went
gaily
along
getting
prouder
and
prouder
for
he
had
never
left
the
boat
in
my
sole
charge
such
a
length
of
time
before
i
even
got
to
setting
her
and
letting
the
wheel
go
entirely
while
i
vaingloriously
turned
my
back
and
inspected
the
stem
marks
and
hummed
a
tune
a
sort
of
easy
indifference
which
i
had
prodigiously
admired
in
bixby
and
other
great
pilots
once
i
inspected
rather
long
and
when
i
faced
to
the
front
again
my
heart
flew
into
my
mouth
so
suddenly
that
if
i
hadn't
clapped
my
teeth
together
i
should
have
lost
it
one
of
those
frightful
bluff
reefs
was
stretching
its
deadly
length
right
across
our
bows
my
head
was
gone
in
a
moment
i
did
not
know
which
end
i
stood
on
i
gasped
and
could
not
get
my
breath
i
spun
the
wheel
down
with
such
rapidity
that
it
wove
itself
together
like
a
spider's
web
the
boat
answered
and
turned
square
away
from
the
reef
but
the
reef
followed
her
i
fled
and
still
it
followed
still
it
kept
right
across
my
bows
i
never
looked
to
see
where
i
was
going
i
only
fled
the
awful
crash
was
imminent
why
didn't
that
villain
come
if
i
committed
the
crime
of
ringing
a
bell
i
might
get
thrown
overboard
but
better
that
than
kill
the
boat
so
in
blind
desperation
i
started
such
a
rattling
shivaree
down
below
as
never
had
astounded
an
engineer
in
this
world
before
i
fancy
amidst
the
frenzy
of
the
bells
the
engines
began
to
back
and
fill
in
a
furious
way
and
my
reason
forsook
its
throne
we
were
about
to
crash
into
the
woods
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
just
then
mr
bixby
stepped
calmly
into
view
on
the
hurricane
deck
my
soul
went
out
to
him
in
gratitude
my
distress
vanished
i
would
have
felt
safe
on
the
brink
of
niagara
with
mr
bixby
on
the
hurricane
deck
he
blandly
and
sweetly
took
his
tooth
pick
out
of
his
mouth
between
his
fingers
as
if
it
were
a
cigar
we
were
just
in
the
act
of
climbing
an
overhanging
big
tree
and
the
passengers
were
scudding
astern
like
rats
and
lifted
up
these
commands
to
me
ever
so
gently
stop
the
starboard
stop
the
larboard
set
her
back
on
both
the
boat
hesitated
halted
pressed
her
nose
among
the
boughs
a
critical
instant
then
reluctantly
began
to
back
away
stop
the
larboard
come
ahead
on
it
stop
the
starboard
come
ahead
on
it
point
her
for
the
bar
i
sailed
away
as
serenely
as
a
summer's
morning
mr
bixby
came
in
and
said
with
mock
simplicity
when
you
have
a
hail
my
boy
you
ought
to
tap
the
big
bell
three
times
before
you
land
so
that
the
engineers
can
get
ready
i
blushed
under
the
sarcasm
and
said
i
hadn't
had
any
hail
ah
then
it
was
for
wood
i
suppose
the
officer
of
the
watch
will
tell
you
when
he
wants
to
wood
up
i
went
on
consuming
and
said
i
wasn't
after
wood
indeed
why
what
could
you
want
over
here
in
the
bend
then
did
you
ever
know
of
a
boat
following
a
bend
up
stream
at
this
stage
of
the
river
no
sir
and
i
wasn't
trying
to
follow
it
i
was
getting
away
from
a
bluff
reef
no
it
wasn't
a
bluff
reef
there
isn't
one
within
three
miles
of
where
you
were
but
i
saw
it
it
was
as
bluff
as
that
one
yonder
just
about
run
over
it
do
you
give
it
as
an
order
yes
run
over
it
if
i
don't
i
wish
i
may
die
all
right
i
am
taking
the
responsibility
i
was
just
as
anxious
to
kill
the
boat
now
as
i
had
been
to
save
her
before
i
impressed
my
orders
upon
my
memory
to
be
used
at
the
inquest
and
made
a
straight
break
for
the
reef
as
it
disappeared
under
our
bows
i
held
my
breath
but
we
slid
over
it
like
oil
now
don't
you
see
the
difference
it
wasn't
anything
but
a
wind
reef
the
wind
does
that
so
i
see
but
it
is
exactly
like
a
bluff
reef
how
am
i
ever
going
to
tell
them
apart
i
can't
tell
you
it
is
an
instinct
by
and
by
you
will
just
naturally
know
one
from
the
other
but
you
never
will
be
able
to
explain
why
or
how
you
know
them
apart
it
turned
out
to
be
true
the
face
of
the
water
in
time
became
a
wonderful
book
a
book
that
was
a
dead
language
to
the
uneducated
passenger
but
which
told
its
mind
to
me
without
reserve
delivering
its
most
cherished
secrets
as
clearly
as
if
it
uttered
them
with
a
voice
and
it
was
not
a
book
to
be
read
once
and
thrown
aside
for
it
had
a
new
story
to
tell
every
day
throughout
the
long
twelve
hundred
miles
there
was
never
a
page
that
was
void
of
interest
never
one
that
you
could
leave
unread
without
loss
never
one
that
you
would
want
to
skip
thinking
you
could
find
higher
enjoyment
in
some
other
thing
there
never
was
so
wonderful
a
book
written
by
man
never
one
whose
interest
was
so
absorbing
so
unflagging
so
sparkingly
renewed
with
every
reperusal
the
passenger
who
could
not
read
it
was
charmed
with
a
peculiar
sort
of
faint
dimple
on
its
surface
on
the
rare
occasions
when
he
did
not
overlook
it
altogether
but
to
the
pilot
that
was
an
italicized
passage
indeed
it
was
more
than
that
it
was
a
legend
of
the
largest
capitals
with
a
string
of
shouting
exclamation
points
at
the
end
of
it
for
it
meant
that
a
wreck
or
a
rock
was
buried
there
that
could
tear
the
life
out
of
the
strongest
vessel
that
ever
floated
it
is
the
faintest
and
simplest
expression
the
water
ever
makes
and
the
most
hideous
to
a
pilot's
eye
in
truth
the
passenger
who
could
not
read
this
book
saw
nothing
but
all
manner
of
pretty
pictures
in
it
painted
by
the
sun
and
shaded
by
the
clouds
whereas
to
the
trained
eye
these
were
not
pictures
at
all
but
the
grimmest
and
most
dead
earnest
of
reading
matter
now
when
i
had
mastered
the
language
of
this
water
and
had
come
to
know
every
trifling
feature
that
bordered
the
great
river
as
familiarly
as
i
knew
the
letters
of
the
alphabet
i
had
made
a
valuable
acquisition
but
i
had
lost
something
too
i
had
lost
something
which
could
never
be
restored
to
me
while
i
lived
all
the
grace
the
beauty
the
poetry
had
gone
out
of
the
majestic
river
i
still
keep
in
mind
a
certain
wonderful
sunset
which
i
witnessed
when
steamboating
was
new
to
me
a
broad
expanse
of
the
river
was
turned
to
blood
in
the
middle
distance
the
red
hue
brightened
into
gold
through
which
a
solitary
log
came
floating
black
and
conspicuous
in
one
place
a
long
slanting
mark
lay
sparkling
upon
the
water
in
another
the
surface
was
broken
by
boiling
tumbling
rings
that
were
as
many
tinted
as
an
opal
where
the
ruddy
flush
was
faintest
was
a
smooth
spot
that
was
covered
with
graceful
circles
and
radiating
lines
ever
so
delicately
traced
the
shore
on
our
left
was
densely
wooded
and
the
somber
shadow
that
fell
from
this
forest
was
broken
in
one
place
by
a
long
ruffled
trail
that
shone
like
silver
and
high
above
the
forest
wall
a
clean
stemmed
dead
tree
waved
a
single
leafy
bough
that
glowed
like
a
flame
in
the
unobstructed
splendor
that
was
flowing
from
the
sun
there
were
graceful
curves
reflected
images
woody
heights
soft
distances
and
over
the
whole
scene
far
and
near
the
dissolving
lights
drifted
steadily
enriching
it
every
passing
moment
with
new
marvels
of
coloring
i
stood
like
one
bewitched
i
drank
it
in
in
a
speechless
rapture
the
world
was
new
to
me
and
i
had
never
seen
anything
like
this
at
home
but
as
i
have
said
a
day
came
when
i
began
to
cease
from
noting
the
glories
and
the
charms
which
the
moon
and
the
sun
and
the
twilight
wrought
upon
the
river's
face
another
day
came
when
i
ceased
altogether
to
note
them
then
if
that
sunset
scene
had
been
repeated
i
should
have
looked
upon
it
without
rapture
and
should
have
commented
upon
it
inwardly
after
this
fashion
this
sun
means
that
we
are
going
to
have
wind
to
morrow
that
floating
log
means
that
the
river
is
rising
small
thanks
to
it
that
slanting
mark
on
the
water
refers
to
a
bluff
reef
which
is
going
to
kill
somebody's
steamboat
one
of
these
nights
if
it
keeps
on
stretching
out
like
that
those
tumbling
boils
show
a
dissolving
bar
and
a
changing
channel
there
the
lines
and
circles
in
the
slick
water
over
yonder
are
a
warning
that
that
troublesome
place
is
shoaling
up
dangerously
that
silver
streak
in
the
shadow
of
the
forest
is
the
break
from
a
new
snag
and
he
has
located
himself
in
the
very
best
place
he
could
have
found
to
fish
for
steamboats
that
tall
dead
tree
with
a
single
living
branch
is
not
going
to
last
long
and
then
how
is
a
body
ever
going
to
get
through
this
blind
place
at
night
without
the
friendly
old
landmark
no
the
romance
and
the
beauty
were
all
gone
from
the
river
all
the
value
any
feature
of
it
had
for
me
now
was
the
amount
of
usefulness
it
could
furnish
toward
compassing
the
safe
piloting
of
a
steamboat
since
those
days
i
have
pitied
doctors
from
my
heart
what
does
the
lovely
flush
in
a
beauty's
cheek
mean
to
a
doctor
but
a
break
that
ripples
above
some
deadly
disease
are
not
all
her
visible
charms
sown
thick
with
what
are
to
him
the
signs
and
symbols
of
hidden
decay
does
he
ever
see
her
beauty
at
all
or
doesn't
he
simply
view
her
professionally
and
comment
upon
her
unwholesome
condition
all
to
himself
and
doesn't
he
sometimes
wonder
whether
he
has
gained
most
or
lost
most
by
learning
his
trade
chapter
completing
my
education
whosoever
has
done
me
the
courtesy
to
read
my
chapters
which
have
preceded
this
may
possibly
wonder
that
i
deal
so
minutely
with
piloting
as
a
science
it
was
the
prime
purpose
of
those
chapters
and
i
am
not
quite
done
yet
i
wish
to
show
in
the
most
patient
and
painstaking
way
what
a
wonderful
science
it
is
ship
channels
are
buoyed
and
lighted
and
therefore
it
is
a
comparatively
easy
undertaking
to
learn
to
run
them
clear
water
rivers
with
gravel
bottoms
change
their
channels
very
gradually
and
therefore
one
needs
to
learn
them
but
once
but
piloting
becomes
another
matter
when
you
apply
it
to
vast
streams
like
the
mississippi
and
the
missouri
whose
alluvial
banks
cave
and
change
constantly
whose
snags
are
always
hunting
up
new
quarters
whose
sandbars
are
never
at
rest
whose
channels
are
for
ever
dodging
and
shirking
and
whose
obstructions
must
be
confronted
in
all
nights
and
all
weathers
without
the
aid
of
a
single
light
house
or
a
single
buoy
for
there
is
neither
light
nor
buoy
to
be
found
anywhere
in
all
this
three
or
four
thousand
miles
of
villainous
river
footnote
at
the
time
referred
to
not
true
now
i
feel
justified
in
enlarging
upon
this
great
science
for
the
reason
that
i
feel
sure
no
one
has
ever
yet
written
a
paragraph
about
it
who
had
piloted
a
steamboat
himself
and
so
had
a
practical
knowledge
of
the
subject
if
the
theme
were
hackneyed
i
should
be
obliged
to
deal
gently
with
the
reader
but
since
it
is
wholly
new
i
have
felt
at
liberty
to
take
up
a
considerable
degree
of
room
with
it
when
i
had
learned
the
name
and
position
of
every
visible
feature
of
the
river
when
i
had
so
mastered
its
shape
that
i
could
shut
my
eyes
and
trace
it
from
st
louis
to
new
orleans
when
i
had
learned
to
read
the
face
of
the
water
as
one
would
cull
the
news
from
the
morning
paper
and
finally
when
i
had
trained
my
dull
memory
to
treasure
up
an
endless
array
of
soundings
and
crossing
marks
and
keep
fast
hold
of
them
i
judged
that
my
education
was
complete
so
i
got
to
tilting
my
cap
to
the
side
of
my
head
and
wearing
a
tooth
pick
in
my
mouth
at
the
wheel
mr
bixby
had
his
eye
on
these
airs
one
day
he
said
what
is
the
height
of
that
bank
yonder
at
burgess's
how
can
i
tell
sir
it
is
three
quarters
of
a
mile
away
very
poor
eye
very
poor
take
the
glass
i
took
the
glass
and
presently
said
i
can't
tell
i
suppose
that
that
bank
is
about
a
foot
and
a
half
high
foot
and
a
half
that's
a
six
foot
bank
how
high
was
the
bank
along
here
last
trip
i
don't
know
i
never
noticed
you
didn't
well
you
must
always
do
it
hereafter
why
because
you'll
have
to
know
a
good
many
things
that
it
tells
you
for
one
thing
it
tells
you
the
stage
of
the
river
tells
you
whether
there's
more
water
or
less
in
the
river
along
here
than
there
was
last
trip
the
leads
tell
me
that
i
rather
thought
i
had
the
advantage
of
him
there
yes
but
suppose
the
leads
lie
the
bank
would
tell
you
so
and
then
you'd
stir
those
leadsmen
up
a
bit
there
was
a
ten
foot
bank
here
last
trip
and
there
is
only
a
six
foot
bank
now
what
does
that
signify
that
the
river
is
four
feet
higher
than
it
was
last
trip
very
good
is
the
river
rising
or
falling
rising
no
it
ain't
i
guess
i
am
right
sir
yonder
is
some
drift
wood
floating
down
the
stream
a
rise
starts
the
drift
wood
but
then
it
keeps
on
floating
a
while
after
the
river
is
done
rising
now
the
bank
will
tell
you
about
this
wait
till
you
come
to
a
place
where
it
shelves
a
little
now
here
do
you
see
this
narrow
belt
of
fine
sediment
that
was
deposited
while
the
water
was
higher
you
see
the
driftwood
begins
to
strand
too
the
bank
helps
in
other
ways
do
you
see
that
stump
on
the
false
point
ay
ay
sir
well
the
water
is
just
up
to
the
roots
of
it
you
must
make
a
note
of
that
why
because
that
means
that
there's
seven
feet
in
the
chute
of
but
is
a
long
way
up
the
river
yet
that's
where
the
benefit
of
the
bank
comes
in
there
is
water
enough
in
now
yet
there
may
not
be
by
the
time
we
get
there
but
the
bank
will
keep
us
posted
all
along
you
don't
run
close
chutes
on
a
falling
river
up
stream
and
there
are
precious
few
of
them
that
you
are
allowed
to
run
at
all
down
stream
there's
a
law
of
the
united
states
against
it
the
river
may
be
rising
by
the
time
we
get
to
and
in
that
case
we'll
run
it
we
are
drawing
how
much
six
feet
aft
six
and
a
half
forward
well
you
do
seem
to
know
something
but
what
i
particularly
want
to
know
is
if
i
have
got
to
keep
up
an
everlasting
measuring
of
the
banks
of
this
river
twelve
hundred
miles
month
in
and
month
out
of
course
my
emotions
were
too
deep
for
words
for
a
while
presently
i
said
and
how
about
these
chutes
are
there
many
of
them
i
should
say
so
i
fancy
we
shan't
run
any
of
the
river
this
trip
as
you've
ever
seen
it
run
before
so
to
speak
if
the
river
begins
to
rise
again
we'll
go
up
behind
bars
that
you've
always
seen
standing
out
of
the
river
high
and
dry
like
the
roof
of
a
house
we'll
cut
across
low
places
that
you've
never
noticed
at
all
right
through
the
middle
of
bars
that
cover
three
hundred
acres
of
river
we'll
creep
through
cracks
where
you've
always
thought
was
solid
land
we'll
dart
through
the
woods
and
leave
twenty
five
miles
of
river
off
to
one
side
we'll
see
the
hind
side
of
every
island
between
new
orleans
and
cairo
then
i've
got
to
go
to
work
and
learn
just
as
much
more
river
as
i
already
know
just
about
twice
as
much
more
as
near
as
you
can
come
at
it
well
one
lives
to
find
out
i
think
i
was
a
fool
when
i
went
into
this
business
yes
that
is
true
and
you
are
yet
but
you'll
not
be
when
you've
learned
it
ah
i
never
can
learn
it
i
will
see
that
you
do
by
and
by
i
ventured
again
have
i
got
to
learn
all
this
thing
just
as
i
know
the
rest
of
the
river
shapes
and
all
and
so
i
can
run
it
at
night
yes
and
you've
got
to
have
good
fair
marks
from
one
end
of
the
river
to
the
other
that
will
help
the
bank
tell
you
when
there
is
water
enough
in
each
of
these
countless
places
like
that
stump
you
know
when
the
river
first
begins
to
rise
you
can
run
half
a
dozen
of
the
deepest
of
them
when
it
rises
a
foot
more
you
can
run
another
dozen
the
next
foot
will
add
a
couple
of
dozen
and
so
on
so
you
see
you
have
to
know
your
banks
and
marks
to
a
dead
moral
certainty
and
never
get
them
mixed
for
when
you
start
through
one
of
those
cracks
there's
no
backing
out
again
as
there
is
in
the
big
river
you've
got
to
go
through
or
stay
there
six
months
if
you
get
caught
on
a
falling
river
there
are
about
fifty
of
these
cracks
which
you
can't
run
at
all
except
when
the
river
is
brim
full
and
over
the
banks
this
new
lesson
is
a
cheerful
prospect
cheerful
enough
and
mind
what
i've
just
told
you
when
you
start
into
one
of
those
places
you've
got
to
go
through
they
are
too
narrow
to
turn
around
in
too
crooked
to
back
out
of
and
the
shoal
water
is
always
up
at
the
head
never
elsewhere
and
the
head
of
them
is
always
likely
to
be
filling
up
little
by
little
so
that
the
marks
you
reckon
their
depth
by
this
season
may
not
answer
for
next
learn
a
new
set
then
every
year
exactly
cramp
her
up
to
the
bar
what
are
you
standing
up
through
the
middle
of
the
river
for
the
next
few
months
showed
me
strange
things
on
the
same
day
that
we
held
the
conversation
above
narrated
we
met
a
great
rise
coming
down
the
river
the
whole
vast
face
of
the
stream
was
black
with
drifting
dead
logs
broken
boughs
and
great
trees
that
had
caved
in
and
been
washed
away
it
required
the
nicest
steering
to
pick
one's
way
through
this
rushing
raft
even
in
the
day
time
when
crossing
from
point
to
point
and
at
night
the
difficulty
was
mightily
increased
every
now
and
then
a
huge
log
lying
deep
in
the
water
would
suddenly
appear
right
under
our
bows
coming
head
on
no
use
to
try
to
avoid
it
then
we
could
only
stop
the
engines
and
one
wheel
would
walk
over
that
log
from
one
end
to
the
other
keeping
up
a
thundering
racket
and
careening
the
boat
in
a
way
that
was
very
uncomfortable
to
passengers
now
and
then
we
would
hit
one
of
these
sunken
logs
a
rattling
bang
dead
in
the
center
with
a
full
head
of
steam
and
it
would
stun
the
boat
as
if
she
had
hit
a
continent
sometimes
this
log
would
lodge
and
stay
right
across
our
nose
and
back
the
mississippi
up
before
it
we
would
have
to
do
a
little
craw
fishing
then
to
get
away
from
the
obstruction
we
often
hit
white
logs
in
the
dark
for
we
could
not
see
them
till
we
were
right
on
them
but
a
black
log
is
a
pretty
distinct
object
at
night
a
white
snag
is
an
ugly
customer
when
the
daylight
is
gone
of
course
on
the
great
rise
down
came
a
swarm
of
prodigious
timber
rafts
from
the
head
waters
of
the
mississippi
coal
barges
from
pittsburgh
little
trading
scows
from
everywhere
and
broad
horns
from
posey
county
indiana
freighted
with
fruit
and
furniture
the
usual
term
for
describing
it
though
in
plain
english
the
freight
thus
aggrandized
was
hoop
poles
and
pumpkins
pilots
bore
a
mortal
hatred
to
these
craft
and
it
was
returned
with
usury
the
law
required
all
such
helpless
traders
to
keep
a
light
burning
but
it
was
a
law
that
was
often
broken
all
of
a
sudden
on
a
murky
night
a
light
would
hop
up
right
under
our
bows
almost
and
an
agonized
voice
with
the
backwoods
whang
to
it
would
wail
out
whar'n
the
you
goin
to
cain't
you
see
nothin
you
dash
dashed
aig
suckin
sheep
stealin
one
eyed
son
of
a
stuffed
monkey
then
for
an
instant
as
we
whistled
by
the
red
glare
from
our
furnaces
would
reveal
the
scow
and
the
form
of
the
gesticulating
orator
as
if
under
a
lightning
flash
and
in
that
instant
our
firemen
and
deck
hands
would
send
and
receive
a
tempest
of
missiles
and
profanity
one
of
our
wheels
would
walk
off
with
the
crashing
fragments
of
a
steering
oar
and
down
the
dead
blackness
would
shut
again
and
that
flatboatman
would
be
sure
to
go
into
new
orleans
and
sue
our
boat
swearing
stoutly
that
he
had
a
light
burning
all
the
time
when
in
truth
his
gang
had
the
lantern
down
below
to
sing
and
lie
and
drink
and
gamble
by
and
no
watch
on
deck
once
at
night
in
one
of
those
forest
bordered
crevices
behind
an
island
which
steamboatmen
intensely
describe
with
the
phrase
as
dark
as
the
inside
of
a
cow
we
should
have
eaten
up
a
posey
county
family
fruit
furniture
and
all
but
that
they
happened
to
be
fiddling
down
below
and
we
just
caught
the
sound
of
the
music
in
time
to
sheer
off
doing
no
serious
damage
unfortunately
but
coming
so
near
it
that
we
had
good
hopes
for
a
moment
these
people
brought
up
their
lantern
then
of
course
and
as
we
backed
and
filled
to
get
away
the
precious
family
stood
in
the
light
of
it
both
sexes
and
various
ages
and
cursed
us
till
everything
turned
blue
once
a
coalboatman
sent
a
bullet
through
our
pilot
house
when
we
borrowed
a
steering
oar
of
him
in
a
very
narrow
place
chapter
the
river
rises
during
this
big
rise
these
small
fry
craft
were
an
intolerable
nuisance
we
were
running
chute
after
chute
a
new
world
to
me
and
if
there
was
a
particularly
cramped
place
in
a
chute
we
would
be
pretty
sure
to
meet
a
broad
horn
there
and
if
he
failed
to
be
there
we
would
find
him
in
a
still
worse
locality
namely
the
head
of
the
chute
on
the
shoal
water
and
then
there
would
be
no
end
of
profane
cordialities
exchanged
sometimes
in
the
big
river
when
we
would
be
feeling
our
way
cautiously
along
through
a
fog
the
deep
hush
would
suddenly
be
broken
by
yells
and
a
clamor
of
tin
pans
and
all
in
instant
a
log
raft
would
appear
vaguely
through
the
webby
veil
close
upon
us
and
then
we
did
not
wait
to
swap
knives
but
snatched
our
engine
bells
out
by
the
roots
and
piled
on
all
the
steam
we
had
to
scramble
out
of
the
way
one
doesn't
hit
a
rock
or
a
solid
log
craft
with
a
steamboat
when
he
can
get
excused
you
will
hardly
believe
it
but
many
steamboat
clerks
always
carried
a
large
assortment
of
religious
tracts
with
them
in
those
old
departed
steamboating
days
indeed
they
did
twenty
times
a
day
we
would
be
cramping
up
around
a
bar
while
a
string
of
these
small
fry
rascals
were
drifting
down
into
the
head
of
the
bend
away
above
and
beyond
us
a
couple
of
miles
now
a
skiff
would
dart
away
from
one
of
them
and
come
fighting
its
laborious
way
across
the
desert
of
water
it
would
ease
all
in
the
shadow
of
our
forecastle
and
the
panting
oarsmen
would
shout
gimme
a
pa
a
per
as
the
skiff
drifted
swiftly
astern
the
clerk
would
throw
over
a
file
of
new
orleans
journals
if
these
were
picked
up
without
comment
you
might
notice
that
now
a
dozen
other
skiffs
had
been
drifting
down
upon
us
without
saying
anything
you
understand
they
had
been
waiting
to
see
how
no
was
going
to
fare
no
making
no
comment
all
the
rest
would
bend
to
their
oars
and
come
on
now
and
as
fast
as
they
came
the
clerk
would
heave
over
neat
bundles
of
religious
tracts
tied
to
shingles
the
amount
of
hard
swearing
which
twelve
packages
of
religious
literature
will
command
when
impartially
divided
up
among
twelve
raftsmen's
crews
who
have
pulled
a
heavy
skiff
two
miles
on
a
hot
day
to
get
them
is
simply
incredible
as
i
have
said
the
big
rise
brought
a
new
world
under
my
vision
by
the
time
the
river
was
over
its
banks
we
had
forsaken
our
old
paths
and
were
hourly
climbing
over
bars
that
had
stood
ten
feet
out
of
water
before
we
were
shaving
stumpy
shores
like
that
at
the
foot
of
madrid
bend
which
i
had
always
seen
avoided
before
we
were
clattering
through
chutes
like
that
of
where
the
opening
at
the
foot
was
an
unbroken
wall
of
timber
till
our
nose
was
almost
at
the
very
spot
some
of
these
chutes
were
utter
solitudes
the
dense
untouched
forest
overhung
both
banks
of
the
crooked
little
crack
and
one
could
believe
that
human
creatures
had
never
intruded
there
before
the
swinging
grape
vines
the
grassy
nooks
and
vistas
glimpsed
as
we
swept
by
the
flowering
creepers
waving
their
red
blossoms
from
the
tops
of
dead
trunks
and
all
the
spendthrift
richness
of
the
forest
foliage
were
wasted
and
thrown
away
there
the
chutes
were
lovely
places
to
steer
in
they
were
deep
except
at
the
head
the
current
was
gentle
under
the
points
the
water
was
absolutely
dead
and
the
invisible
banks
so
bluff
that
where
the
tender
willow
thickets
projected
you
could
bury
your
boat's
broadside
in
them
as
you
tore
along
and
then
you
seemed
fairly
to
fly
behind
other
islands
we
found
wretched
little
farms
and
wretcheder
little
log
cabins
there
were
crazy
rail
fences
sticking
a
foot
or
two
above
the
water
with
one
or
two
jeans
clad
chills
racked
yellow
faced
male
miserables
roosting
on
the
top
rail
elbows
on
knees
jaws
in
hands
grinding
tobacco
and
discharging
the
result
at
floating
chips
through
crevices
left
by
lost
teeth
while
the
rest
of
the
family
and
the
few
farm
animals
were
huddled
together
in
an
empty
wood
flat
riding
at
her
moorings
close
at
hand
in
this
flat
boat
the
family
would
have
to
cook
and
eat
and
sleep
for
a
lesser
or
greater
number
of
days
or
possibly
weeks
until
the
river
should
fall
two
or
three
feet
and
let
them
get
back
to
their
log
cabin
and
their
chills
again
chills
being
a
merciful
provision
of
an
all
wise
providence
to
enable
them
to
take
exercise
without
exertion
and
this
sort
of
watery
camping
out
was
a
thing
which
these
people
were
rather
liable
to
be
treated
to
a
couple
of
times
a
year
by
the
december
rise
out
of
the
ohio
and
the
june
rise
out
of
the
mississippi
and
yet
these
were
kindly
dispensations
for
they
at
least
enabled
the
poor
things
to
rise
from
the
dead
now
and
then
and
look
upon
life
when
a
steamboat
went
by
they
appreciated
the
blessing
too
for
they
spread
their
mouths
and
eyes
wide
open
and
made
the
most
of
these
occasions
now
what
could
these
banished
creatures
find
to
do
to
keep
from
dying
of
the
blues
during
the
low
water
season
once
in
one
of
these
lovely
island
chutes
we
found
our
course
completely
bridged
by
a
great
fallen
tree
this
will
serve
to
show
how
narrow
some
of
the
chutes
were
the
passengers
had
an
hour's
recreation
in
a
virgin
wilderness
while
the
boat
hands
chopped
the
bridge
away
for
there
was
no
such
thing
as
turning
back
you
comprehend
from
cairo
to
baton
rouge
when
the
river
is
over
its
banks
you
have
no
particular
trouble
in
the
night
for
the
thousand
mile
wall
of
dense
forest
that
guards
the
two
banks
all
the
way
is
only
gapped
with
a
farm
or
wood
yard
opening
at
intervals
and
so
you
can't
get
out
of
the
river
much
easier
than
you
could
get
out
of
a
fenced
lane
but
from
baton
rouge
to
new
orleans
it
is
a
different
matter
the
river
is
more
than
a
mile
wide
and
very
deep
as
much
as
two
hundred
feet
in
places
both
banks
for
a
good
deal
over
a
hundred
miles
are
shorn
of
their
timber
and
bordered
by
continuous
sugar
plantations
with
only
here
and
there
a
scattering
sapling
or
row
of
ornamental
china
trees
the
timber
is
shorn
off
clear
to
the
rear
of
the
plantations
from
two
to
four
miles
when
the
first
frost
threatens
to
come
the
planters
snatch
off
their
crops
in
a
hurry
when
they
have
finished
grinding
the
cane
they
form
the
refuse
of
the
stalks
which
they
call
bagasse
into
great
piles
and
set
fire
to
them
though
in
other
sugar
countries
the
bagasse
is
used
for
fuel
in
the
furnaces
of
the
sugar
mills
now
the
piles
of
damp
bagasse
burn
slowly
and
smoke
like
satan's
own
kitchen
an
embankment
ten
or
fifteen
feet
high
guards
both
banks
of
the
mississippi
all
the
way
down
that
lower
end
of
the
river
and
this
embankment
is
set
back
from
the
edge
of
the
shore
from
ten
to
perhaps
a
hundred
feet
according
to
circumstances
say
thirty
or
forty
feet
as
a
general
thing
fill
that
whole
region
with
an
impenetrable
gloom
of
smoke
from
a
hundred
miles
of
burning
bagasse
piles
when
the
river
is
over
the
banks
and
turn
a
steamboat
loose
along
there
at
midnight
and
see
how
she
will
feel
and
see
how
you
will
feel
too
you
find
yourself
away
out
in
the
midst
of
a
vague
dim
sea
that
is
shoreless
that
fades
out
and
loses
itself
in
the
murky
distances
for
you
cannot
discern
the
thin
rib
of
embankment
and
you
are
always
imagining
you
see
a
straggling
tree
when
you
don't
the
plantations
themselves
are
transformed
by
the
smoke
and
look
like
a
part
of
the
sea
all
through
your
watch
you
are
tortured
with
the
exquisite
misery
of
uncertainty
you
hope
you
are
keeping
in
the
river
but
you
do
not
know
all
that
you
are
sure
about
is
that
you
are
likely
to
be
within
six
feet
of
the
bank
and
destruction
when
you
think
you
are
a
good
half
mile
from
shore
and
you
are
sure
also
that
if
you
chance
suddenly
to
fetch
up
against
the
embankment
and
topple
your
chimneys
overboard
you
will
have
the
small
comfort
of
knowing
that
it
is
about
what
you
were
expecting
to
do
one
of
the
great
vicksburg
packets
darted
out
into
a
sugar
plantation
one
night
at
such
a
time
and
had
to
stay
there
a
week
but
there
was
no
novelty
about
it
it
had
often
been
done
before
i
thought
i
had
finished
this
chapter
but
i
wish
to
add
a
curious
thing
while
it
is
in
my
mind
it
is
only
relevant
in
that
it
is
connected
with
piloting
there
used
to
be
an
excellent
pilot
on
the
river
a
mr
x
who
was
a
somnambulist
it
was
said
that
if
his
mind
was
troubled
about
a
bad
piece
of
river
he
was
pretty
sure
to
get
up
and
walk
in
his
sleep
and
do
strange
things
he
was
once
fellow
pilot
for
a
trip
or
two
with
george
ealer
on
a
great
new
orleans
passenger
packet
during
a
considerable
part
of
the
first
trip
george
was
uneasy
but
got
over
it
by
and
by
as
x
seemed
content
to
stay
in
his
bed
when
asleep
late
one
night
the
boat
was
approaching
helena
arkansas
the
water
was
low
and
the
crossing
above
the
town
in
a
very
blind
and
tangled
condition
x
had
seen
the
crossing
since
ealer
had
and
as
the
night
was
particularly
drizzly
sullen
and
dark
ealer
was
considering
whether
he
had
not
better
have
x
called
to
assist
in
running
the
place
when
the
door
opened
and
x
walked
in
now
on
very
dark
nights
light
is
a
deadly
enemy
to
piloting
you
are
aware
that
if
you
stand
in
a
lighted
room
on
such
a
night
you
cannot
see
things
in
the
street
to
any
purpose
but
if
you
put
out
the
lights
and
stand
in
the
gloom
you
can
make
out
objects
in
the
street
pretty
well
so
on
very
dark
nights
pilots
do
not
smoke
they
allow
no
fire
in
the
pilot
house
stove
if
there
is
a
crack
which
can
allow
the
least
ray
to
escape
they
order
the
furnaces
to
be
curtained
with
huge
tarpaulins
and
the
sky
lights
to
be
closely
blinded
then
no
light
whatever
issues
from
the
boat
the
undefinable
shape
that
now
entered
the
pilot
house
had
mr
x
s
voice
this
said
let
me
take
her
george
i've
seen
this
place
since
you
have
and
it
is
so
crooked
that
i
reckon
i
can
run
it
myself
easier
than
i
could
tell
you
how
to
do
it
it
is
kind
of
you
and
i
swear
i
am
willing
i
haven't
got
another
drop
of
perspiration
left
in
me
i
have
been
spinning
around
and
around
the
wheel
like
a
squirrel
it
is
so
dark
i
can't
tell
which
way
she
is
swinging
till
she
is
coming
around
like
a
whirligig
so
ealer
took
a
seat
on
the
bench
panting
and
breathless
the
black
phantom
assumed
the
wheel
without
saying
anything
steadied
the
waltzing
steamer
with
a
turn
or
two
and
then
stood
at
ease
coaxing
her
a
little
to
this
side
and
then
to
that
as
gently
and
as
sweetly
as
if
the
time
had
been
noonday
when
ealer
observed
this
marvel
of
steering
he
wished
he
had
not
confessed
he
stared
and
wondered
and
finally
said
well
i
thought
i
knew
how
to
steer
a
steamboat
but
that
was
another
mistake
of
mine
x
said
nothing
but
went
serenely
on
with
his
work
he
rang
for
the
leads
he
rang
to
slow
down
the
steam
he
worked
the
boat
carefully
and
neatly
into
invisible
marks
then
stood
at
the
center
of
the
wheel
and
peered
blandly
out
into
the
blackness
fore
and
aft
to
verify
his
position
as
the
leads
shoaled
more
and
more
he
stopped
the
engines
entirely
and
the
dead
silence
and
suspense
of
drifting
followed
when
the
shoalest
water
was
struck
he
cracked
on
the
steam
carried
her
handsomely
over
and
then
began
to
work
her
warily
into
the
next
system
of
shoal
marks
the
same
patient
heedful
use
of
leads
and
engines
followed
the
boat
slipped
through
without
touching
bottom
and
entered
upon
the
third
and
last
intricacy
of
the
crossing
imperceptibly
she
moved
through
the
gloom
crept
by
inches
into
her
marks
drifted
tediously
till
the
shoalest
water
was
cried
and
then
under
a
tremendous
head
of
steam
went
swinging
over
the
reef
and
away
into
deep
water
and
safety
ealer
let
his
long
pent
breath
pour
out
in
a
great
relieving
sigh
and
said
that's
the
sweetest
piece
of
piloting
that
was
ever
done
on
the
mississippi
river
i
wouldn't
believed
it
could
be
done
if
i
hadn't
seen
it
there
was
no
reply
and
he
added
just
hold
her
five
minutes
longer
partner
and
let
me
run
down
and
get
a
cup
of
coffee
a
minute
later
ealer
was
biting
into
a
pie
down
in
the
texas
and
comforting
himself
with
coffee
just
then
the
night
watchman
happened
in
and
was
about
to
happen
out
again
when
he
noticed
ealer
and
exclaimed
who
is
at
the
wheel
sir
x
dart
for
the
pilot
house
quicker
than
lightning
the
next
moment
both
men
were
flying
up
the
pilot
house
companion
way
three
steps
at
a
jump
nobody
there
the
great
steamer
was
whistling
down
the
middle
of
the
river
at
her
own
sweet
will
the
watchman
shot
out
of
the
place
again
ealer
seized
the
wheel
set
an
engine
back
with
power
and
held
his
breath
while
the
boat
reluctantly
swung
away
from
a
towhead
which
she
was
about
to
knock
into
the
middle
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
by
and
by
the
watchman
came
back
and
said
didn't
that
lunatic
tell
you
he
was
asleep
when
he
first
came
up
here
no
well
he
was
i
found
him
walking
along
on
top
of
the
railings
just
as
unconcerned
as
another
man
would
walk
a
pavement
and
i
put
him
to
bed
now
just
this
minute
there
he
was
again
away
astern
going
through
that
sort
of
tight
rope
deviltry
the
same
as
before
well
i
think
i'll
stay
by
next
time
he
has
one
of
those
fits
but
i
hope
he'll
have
them
often
you
just
ought
to
have
seen
him
take
this
boat
through
helena
crossing
i
never
saw
anything
so
gaudy
before
and
if
he
can
do
such
gold
leaf
kid
glove
diamond
breastpin
piloting
when
he
is
sound
asleep
what
couldn't
he
do
if
he
was
dead
chapter
sounding
when
the
river
is
very
low
and
one's
steamboat
is
drawing
all
the
water
there
is
in
the
channel
or
a
few
inches
more
as
was
often
the
case
in
the
old
times
one
must
be
painfully
circumspect
in
his
piloting
we
used
to
have
to
sound
a
number
of
particularly
bad
places
almost
every
trip
when
the
river
was
at
a
very
low
stage
sounding
is
done
in
this
way
the
boat
ties
up
at
the
shore
just
above
the
shoal
crossing
the
pilot
not
on
watch
takes
his
cub
or
steersman
and
a
picked
crew
of
men
sometimes
an
officer
also
and
goes
out
in
the
yawl
provided
the
boat
has
not
that
rare
and
sumptuous
luxury
a
regularly
devised
sounding
boat
and
proceeds
to
hunt
for
the
best
water
the
pilot
on
duty
watching
his
movements
through
a
spy
glass
meantime
and
in
some
instances
assisting
by
signals
of
the
boat's
whistle
signifying
try
higher
up
or
try
lower
down
for
the
surface
of
the
water
like
an
oil
painting
is
more
expressive
and
intelligible
when
inspected
from
a
little
distance
than
very
close
at
hand
the
whistle
signals
are
seldom
necessary
however
never
perhaps
except
when
the
wind
confuses
the
significant
ripples
upon
the
water's
surface
when
the
yawl
has
reached
the
shoal
place
the
speed
is
slackened
the
pilot
begins
to
sound
the
depth
with
a
pole
ten
or
twelve
feet
long
and
the
steersman
at
the
tiller
obeys
the
order
to
hold
her
up
to
starboard
or
let
her
fall
off
to
larboard
footnote
term
larboard
is
never
used
at
sea
now
to
signify
the
left
hand
but
was
always
used
on
the
river
in
my
or
steady
steady
as
you
go
when
the
measurements
indicate
that
the
yawl
is
approaching
the
shoalest
part
of
the
reef
the
command
is
given
to
ease
all
then
the
men
stop
rowing
and
the
yawl
drifts
with
the
current
the
next
order
is
stand
by
with
the
buoy
the
moment
the
shallowest
point
is
reached
the
pilot
delivers
the
order
let
go
the
buoy
and
over
she
goes
if
the
pilot
is
not
satisfied
he
sounds
the
place
again
if
he
finds
better
water
higher
up
or
lower
down
he
removes
the
buoy
to
that
place
being
finally
satisfied
he
gives
the
order
and
all
the
men
stand
their
oars
straight
up
in
the
air
in
line
a
blast
from
the
boat's
whistle
indicates
that
the
signal
has
been
seen
then
the
men
give
way
on
their
oars
and
lay
the
yawl
alongside
the
buoy
the
steamer
comes
creeping
carefully
down
is
pointed
straight
at
the
buoy
husbands
her
power
for
the
coming
struggle
and
presently
at
the
critical
moment
turns
on
all
her
steam
and
goes
grinding
and
wallowing
over
the
buoy
and
the
sand
and
gains
the
deep
water
beyond
or
maybe
she
doesn't
maybe
she
strikes
and
swings
then
she
has
to
while
away
several
hours
or
days
sparring
herself
off
sometimes
a
buoy
is
not
laid
at
all
but
the
yawl
goes
ahead
hunting
the
best
water
and
the
steamer
follows
along
in
its
wake
often
there
is
a
deal
of
fun
and
excitement
about
sounding
especially
if
it
is
a
glorious
summer
day
or
a
blustering
night
but
in
winter
the
cold
and
the
peril
take
most
of
the
fun
out
of
it
a
buoy
is
nothing
but
a
board
four
or
five
feet
long
with
one
end
turned
up
it
is
a
reversed
school
house
bench
with
one
of
the
supports
left
and
the
other
removed
it
is
anchored
on
the
shoalest
part
of
the
reef
by
a
rope
with
a
heavy
stone
made
fast
to
the
end
of
it
but
for
the
resistance
of
the
turned
up
end
of
the
reversed
bench
the
current
would
pull
the
buoy
under
water
at
night
a
paper
lantern
with
a
candle
in
it
is
fastened
on
top
of
the
buoy
and
this
can
be
seen
a
mile
or
more
a
little
glimmering
spark
in
the
waste
of
blackness
nothing
delights
a
cub
so
much
as
an
opportunity
to
go
out
sounding
there
is
such
an
air
of
adventure
about
it
often
there
is
danger
it
is
so
gaudy
and
man
of
war
like
to
sit
up
in
the
stern
sheets
and
steer
a
swift
yawl
there
is
something
fine
about
the
exultant
spring
of
the
boat
when
an
experienced
old
sailor
crew
throw
their
souls
into
the
oars
it
is
lovely
to
see
the
white
foam
stream
away
from
the
bows
there
is
music
in
the
rush
of
the
water
it
is
deliciously
exhilarating
in
summer
to
go
speeding
over
the
breezy
expanses
of
the
river
when
the
world
of
wavelets
is
dancing
in
the
sun
it
is
such
grandeur
too
to
the
cub
to
get
a
chance
to
give
an
order
for
often
the
pilot
will
simply
say
let
her
go
about
and
leave
the
rest
to
the
cub
who
instantly
cries
in
his
sternest
tone
of
command
ease
starboard
strong
on
the
larboard
starboard
give
way
with
a
will
men
the
cub
enjoys
sounding
for
the
further
reason
that
the
eyes
of
the
passengers
are
watching
all
the
yawl's
movements
with
absorbing
interest
if
the
time
be
daylight
and
if
it
be
night
he
knows
that
those
same
wondering
eyes
are
fastened
upon
the
yawl's
lantern
as
it
glides
out
into
the
gloom
and
dims
away
in
the
remote
distance
one
trip
a
pretty
girl
of
sixteen
spent
her
time
in
our
pilot
house
with
her
uncle
and
aunt
every
day
and
all
day
long
i
fell
in
love
with
her
so
did
mr
thornburg's
cub
tom
g
tom
and
i
had
been
bosom
friends
until
this
time
but
now
a
coolness
began
to
arise
i
told
the
girl
a
good
many
of
my
river
adventures
and
made
myself
out
a
good
deal
of
a
hero
tom
tried
to
make
himself
appear
to
be
a
hero
too
and
succeeded
to
some
extent
but
then
he
always
had
a
way
of
embroidering
however
virtue
is
its
own
reward
so
i
was
a
barely
perceptible
trifle
ahead
in
the
contest
about
this
time
something
happened
which
promised
handsomely
for
me
the
pilots
decided
to
sound
the
crossing
at
the
head
of
this
would
occur
about
nine
or
ten
o'clock
at
night
when
the
passengers
would
be
still
up
it
would
be
mr
thornburg's
watch
therefore
my
chief
would
have
to
do
the
sounding
we
had
a
perfect
love
of
a
sounding
boat
long
trim
graceful
and
as
fleet
as
a
greyhound
her
thwarts
were
cushioned
she
carried
twelve
oarsmen
one
of
the
mates
was
always
sent
in
her
to
transmit
orders
to
her
crew
for
ours
was
a
steamer
where
no
end
of
style
was
put
on
we
tied
up
at
the
shore
above
and
got
ready
it
was
a
foul
night
and
the
river
was
so
wide
there
that
a
landsman's
uneducated
eyes
could
discern
no
opposite
shore
through
such
a
gloom
the
passengers
were
alert
and
interested
everything
was
satisfactory
as
i
hurried
through
the
engine
room
picturesquely
gotten
up
in
storm
toggery
i
met
tom
and
could
not
forbear
delivering
myself
of
a
mean
speech
ain't
you
glad
you
don't
have
to
go
out
sounding
tom
was
passing
on
but
he
quickly
turned
and
said
now
just
for
that
you
can
go
and
get
the
sounding
pole
yourself
i
was
going
after
it
but
i'd
see
you
in
halifax
now
before
i'd
do
it
who
wants
you
to
get
it
i
don't
it's
in
the
sounding
boat
it
ain't
either
it's
been
new
painted
and
it's
been
up
on
the
ladies
cabin
guards
two
days
drying
i
flew
back
and
shortly
arrived
among
the
crowd
of
watching
and
wondering
ladies
just
in
time
to
hear
the
command
give
way
men
i
looked
over
and
there
was
the
gallant
sounding
boat
booming
away
the
unprincipled
tom
presiding
at
the
tiller
and
my
chief
sitting
by
him
with
the
sounding
pole
which
i
had
been
sent
on
a
fool's
errand
to
fetch
then
that
young
girl
said
to
me
oh
how
awful
to
have
to
go
out
in
that
little
boat
on
such
a
night
do
you
think
there
is
any
danger
i
would
rather
have
been
stabbed
i
went
off
full
of
venom
to
help
in
the
pilot
house
by
and
by
the
boat's
lantern
disappeared
and
after
an
interval
a
wee
spark
glimmered
upon
the
face
of
the
water
a
mile
away
mr
thornburg
blew
the
whistle
in
acknowledgment
backed
the
steamer
out
and
made
for
it
we
flew
along
for
a
while
then
slackened
steam
and
went
cautiously
gliding
toward
the
spark
presently
mr
thornburg
exclaimed
hello
the
buoy
lantern's
out
he
stopped
the
engines
a
moment
or
two
later
he
said
why
there
it
is
again
so
he
came
ahead
on
the
engines
once
more
and
rang
for
the
leads
gradually
the
water
shoaled
up
and
then
began
to
deepen
again
mr
thornburg
muttered
well
i
don't
understand
this
i
believe
that
buoy
has
drifted
off
the
reef
seems
to
be
a
little
too
far
to
the
left
no
matter
it
is
safest
to
run
over
it
anyhow
so
in
that
solid
world
of
darkness
we
went
creeping
down
on
the
light
just
as
our
bows
were
in
the
act
of
plowing
over
it
mr
thornburg
seized
the
bell
ropes
rang
a
startling
peal
and
exclaimed
my
soul
it's
the
sounding
boat
a
sudden
chorus
of
wild
alarms
burst
out
far
below
a
pause
and
then
the
sound
of
grinding
and
crashing
followed
mr
thornburg
exclaimed
there
the
paddle
wheel
has
ground
the
sounding
boat
to
lucifer
matches
run
see
who
is
killed
i
was
on
the
main
deck
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
my
chief
and
the
third
mate
and
nearly
all
the
men
were
safe
they
had
discovered
their
danger
when
it
was
too
late
to
pull
out
of
the
way
then
when
the
great
guards
overshadowed
them
a
moment
later
they
were
prepared
and
knew
what
to
do
at
my
chiefs
order
they
sprang
at
the
right
instant
seized
the
guard
and
were
hauled
aboard
the
next
moment
the
sounding
yawl
swept
aft
to
the
wheel
and
was
struck
and
splintered
to
atoms
two
of
the
men
and
the
cub
tom
were
missing
a
fact
which
spread
like
wildfire
over
the
boat
the
passengers
came
flocking
to
the
forward
gangway
ladies
and
all
anxious
eyed
white
faced
and
talked
in
awed
voices
of
the
dreadful
thing
and
often
and
again
i
heard
them
say
poor
fellows
poor
boy
poor
boy
by
this
time
the
boat's
yawl
was
manned
and
away
to
search
for
the
missing
now
a
faint
call
was
heard
off
to
the
left
the
yawl
had
disappeared
in
the
other
direction
half
the
people
rushed
to
one
side
to
encourage
the
swimmer
with
their
shouts
the
other
half
rushed
the
other
way
to
shriek
to
the
yawl
to
turn
about
by
the
callings
the
swimmer
was
approaching
but
some
said
the
sound
showed
failing
strength
the
crowd
massed
themselves
against
the
boiler
deck
railings
leaning
over
and
staring
into
the
gloom
and
every
faint
and
fainter
cry
wrung
from
them
such
words
as
ah
poor
fellow
poor
fellow
is
there
no
way
to
save
him
but
still
the
cries
held
out
and
drew
nearer
and
presently
the
voice
said
pluckily
i
can
make
it
stand
by
with
a
rope
what
a
rousing
cheer
they
gave
him
the
chief
mate
took
his
stand
in
the
glare
of
a
torch
basket
a
coil
of
rope
in
his
hand
and
his
men
grouped
about
him
the
next
moment
the
swimmer's
face
appeared
in
the
circle
of
light
and
in
another
one
the
owner
of
it
was
hauled
aboard
limp
and
drenched
while
cheer
on
cheer
went
up
it
was
that
devil
tom
the
yawl
crew
searched
everywhere
but
found
no
sign
of
the
two
men
they
probably
failed
to
catch
the
guard
tumbled
back
and
were
struck
by
the
wheel
and
killed
tom
had
never
jumped
for
the
guard
at
all
but
had
plunged
head
first
into
the
river
and
dived
under
the
wheel
it
was
nothing
i
could
have
done
it
easy
enough
and
i
said
so
but
everybody
went
on
just
the
same
making
a
wonderful
to
do
over
that
ass
as
if
he
had
done
something
great
that
girl
couldn't
seem
to
have
enough
of
that
pitiful
hero
the
rest
of
the
trip
but
little
i
cared
i
loathed
her
any
way
the
way
we
came
to
mistake
the
sounding
boat's
lantern
for
the
buoy
light
was
this
my
chief
said
that
after
laying
the
buoy
he
fell
away
and
watched
it
till
it
seemed
to
be
secure
then
he
took
up
a
position
a
hundred
yards
below
it
and
a
little
to
one
side
of
the
steamer's
course
headed
the
sounding
boat
up
stream
and
waited
having
to
wait
some
time
he
and
the
officer
got
to
talking
he
looked
up
when
he
judged
that
the
steamer
was
about
on
the
reef
saw
that
the
buoy
was
gone
but
supposed
that
the
steamer
had
already
run
over
it
he
went
on
with
his
talk
he
noticed
that
the
steamer
was
getting
very
close
on
him
but
that
was
the
correct
thing
it
was
her
business
to
shave
him
closely
for
convenience
in
taking
him
aboard
he
was
expecting
her
to
sheer
off
until
the
last
moment
then
it
flashed
upon
him
that
she
was
trying
to
run
him
down
mistaking
his
lantern
for
the
buoy
light
so
he
sang
out
stand
by
to
spring
for
the
guard
men
and
the
next
instant
the
jump
was
made
chapter
a
pilot's
needs
but
i
am
wandering
from
what
i
was
intending
to
do
that
is
make
plainer
than
perhaps
appears
in
the
previous
chapters
some
of
the
peculiar
requirements
of
the
science
of
piloting
first
of
all
there
is
one
faculty
which
a
pilot
must
incessantly
cultivate
until
he
has
brought
it
to
absolute
perfection
nothing
short
of
perfection
will
do
that
faculty
is
memory
he
cannot
stop
with
merely
thinking
a
thing
is
so
and
so
he
must
know
it
for
this
is
eminently
one
of
the
exact
sciences
with
what
scorn
a
pilot
was
looked
upon
in
the
old
times
if
he
ever
ventured
to
deal
in
that
feeble
phrase
i
think
instead
of
the
vigorous
one
i
know
one
cannot
easily
realize
what
a
tremendous
thing
it
is
to
know
every
trivial
detail
of
twelve
hundred
miles
of
river
and
know
it
with
absolute
exactness
if
you
will
take
the
longest
street
in
new
york
and
travel
up
and
down
it
conning
its
features
patiently
until
you
know
every
house
and
window
and
door
and
lamp
post
and
big
and
little
sign
by
heart
and
know
them
so
accurately
that
you
can
instantly
name
the
one
you
are
abreast
of
when
you
are
set
down
at
random
in
that
street
in
the
middle
of
an
inky
black
night
you
will
then
have
a
tolerable
notion
of
the
amount
and
the
exactness
of
a
pilot's
knowledge
who
carries
the
mississippi
river
in
his
head
and
then
if
you
will
go
on
until
you
know
every
street
crossing
the
character
size
and
position
of
the
crossing
stones
and
the
varying
depth
of
mud
in
each
of
those
numberless
places
you
will
have
some
idea
of
what
the
pilot
must
know
in
order
to
keep
a
mississippi
steamer
out
of
trouble
next
if
you
will
take
half
of
the
signs
in
that
long
street
and
change
their
places
once
a
month
and
still
manage
to
know
their
new
positions
accurately
on
dark
nights
and
keep
up
with
these
repeated
changes
without
making
any
mistakes
you
will
understand
what
is
required
of
a
pilot's
peerless
memory
by
the
fickle
mississippi
i
think
a
pilot's
memory
is
about
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
the
world
to
know
the
old
and
new
testaments
by
heart
and
be
able
to
recite
them
glibly
forward
or
backward
or
begin
at
random
anywhere
in
the
book
and
recite
both
ways
and
never
trip
or
make
a
mistake
is
no
extravagant
mass
of
knowledge
and
no
marvelous
facility
compared
to
a
pilot's
massed
knowledge
of
the
mississippi
and
his
marvelous
facility
in
the
handling
of
it
i
make
this
comparison
deliberately
and
believe
i
am
not
expanding
the
truth
when
i
do
it
many
will
think
my
figure
too
strong
but
pilots
will
not
and
how
easily
and
comfortably
the
pilot's
memory
does
its
work
how
placidly
effortless
is
its
way
how
unconsciously
it
lays
up
its
vast
stores
hour
by
hour
day
by
day
and
never
loses
or
mislays
a
single
valuable
package
of
them
all
take
an
instance
let
a
leadsman
cry
half
twain
half
twain
half
twain
half
twain
half
twain
until
it
become
as
monotonous
as
the
ticking
of
a
clock
let
conversation
be
going
on
all
the
time
and
the
pilot
be
doing
his
share
of
the
talking
and
no
longer
consciously
listening
to
the
leadsman
and
in
the
midst
of
this
endless
string
of
half
twains
let
a
single
quarter
twain
be
interjected
without
emphasis
and
then
the
half
twain
cry
go
on
again
just
as
before
two
or
three
weeks
later
that
pilot
can
describe
with
precision
the
boat's
position
in
the
river
when
that
quarter
twain
was
uttered
and
give
you
such
a
lot
of
head
marks
stern
marks
and
side
marks
to
guide
you
that
you
ought
to
be
able
to
take
the
boat
there
and
put
her
in
that
same
spot
again
yourself
the
cry
of
quarter
twain
did
not
really
take
his
mind
from
his
talk
but
his
trained
faculties
instantly
photographed
the
bearings
noted
the
change
of
depth
and
laid
up
the
important
details
for
future
reference
without
requiring
any
assistance
from
him
in
the
matter
if
you
were
walking
and
talking
with
a
friend
and
another
friend
at
your
side
kept
up
a
monotonous
repetition
of
the
vowel
sound
a
for
a
couple
of
blocks
and
then
in
the
midst
interjected
an
r
thus
a
a
a
a
a
r
a
a
a
etc
and
gave
the
r
no
emphasis
you
would
not
be
able
to
state
two
or
three
weeks
afterward
that
the
r
had
been
put
in
nor
be
able
to
tell
what
objects
you
were
passing
at
the
moment
it
was
done
but
you
could
if
your
memory
had
been
patiently
and
laboriously
trained
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
mechanically
give
a
man
a
tolerably
fair
memory
to
start
with
and
piloting
will
develop
it
into
a
very
colossus
of
capability
but
only
in
the
matters
it
is
daily
drilled
in
a
time
would
come
when
the
man's
faculties
could
not
help
noticing
landmarks
and
soundings
and
his
memory
could
not
help
holding
on
to
them
with
the
grip
of
a
vise
but
if
you
asked
that
same
man
at
noon
what
he
had
had
for
breakfast
it
would
be
ten
chances
to
one
that
he
could
not
tell
you
astonishing
things
can
be
done
with
the
human
memory
if
you
will
devote
it
faithfully
to
one
particular
line
of
business
at
the
time
that
wages
soared
so
high
on
the
missouri
river
my
chief
mr
bixby
went
up
there
and
learned
more
than
a
thousand
miles
of
that
stream
with
an
ease
and
rapidity
that
were
astonishing
when
he
had
seen
each
division
once
in
the
daytime
and
once
at
night
his
education
was
so
nearly
complete
that
he
took
out
a
daylight
license
a
few
trips
later
he
took
out
a
full
license
and
went
to
piloting
day
and
night
and
he
ranked
a
too
mr
bixby
placed
me
as
steersman
for
a
while
under
a
pilot
whose
feats
of
memory
were
a
constant
marvel
to
me
however
his
memory
was
born
in
him
i
think
not
built
for
instance
somebody
would
mention
a
name
instantly
mr
brown
would
break
in
oh
i
knew
him
sallow
faced
red
headed
fellow
with
a
little
scar
on
the
side
of
his
throat
like
a
splinter
under
the
flesh
he
was
only
in
the
southern
trade
six
months
that
was
thirteen
years
ago
i
made
a
trip
with
him
there
was
five
feet
in
the
upper
river
then
the
henry
blake
grounded
at
the
foot
of
tower
island
drawing
four
and
a
half
the
george
elliott
unshipped
her
rudder
on
the
wreck
of
the
sunflower
why
the
sunflower
didn't
sink
until
i
know
when
she
sunk
it
was
three
years
before
that
on
the
of
december
asa
hardy
was
captain
of
her
and
his
brother
john
was
first
clerk
and
it
was
his
first
trip
in
her
too
tom
jones
told
me
these
things
a
week
afterward
in
new
orleans
he
was
first
mate
of
the
sunflower
captain
hardy
stuck
a
nail
in
his
foot
the
of
july
of
the
next
year
and
died
of
the
lockjaw
on
the
his
brother
died
two
years
after
of
march
erysipelas
i
never
saw
either
of
the
hardys
they
were
alleghany
river
men
but
people
who
knew
them
told
me
all
these
things
and
they
said
captain
hardy
wore
yarn
socks
winter
and
summer
just
the
same
and
his
first
wife's
name
was
jane
shook
she
was
from
new
england
and
his
second
one
died
in
a
lunatic
asylum
it
was
in
the
blood
she
was
from
lexington
kentucky
name
was
horton
before
she
was
married
and
so
on
by
the
hour
the
man's
tongue
would
go
he
could
not
forget
any
thing
it
was
simply
impossible
the
most
trivial
details
remained
as
distinct
and
luminous
in
his
head
after
they
had
lain
there
for
years
as
the
most
memorable
events
his
was
not
simply
a
pilot's
memory
its
grasp
was
universal
if
he
were
talking
about
a
trifling
letter
he
had
received
seven
years
before
he
was
pretty
sure
to
deliver
you
the
entire
screed
from
memory
and
then
without
observing
that
he
was
departing
from
the
true
line
of
his
talk
he
was
more
than
likely
to
hurl
in
a
long
drawn
parenthetical
biography
of
the
writer
of
that
letter
and
you
were
lucky
indeed
if
he
did
not
take
up
that
writer's
relatives
one
by
one
and
give
you
their
biographies
too
such
a
memory
as
that
is
a
great
misfortune
to
it
all
occurrences
are
of
the
same
size
its
possessor
cannot
distinguish
an
interesting
circumstance
from
an
uninteresting
one
as
a
talker
he
is
bound
to
clog
his
narrative
with
tiresome
details
and
make
himself
an
insufferable
bore
moreover
he
cannot
stick
to
his
subject
he
picks
up
every
little
grain
of
memory
he
discerns
in
his
way
and
so
is
led
aside
mr
brown
would
start
out
with
the
honest
intention
of
telling
you
a
vastly
funny
anecdote
about
a
dog
he
would
be
so
full
of
laugh
that
he
could
hardly
begin
then
his
memory
would
start
with
the
dog's
breed
and
personal
appearance
drift
into
a
history
of
his
owner
of
his
owner's
family
with
descriptions
of
weddings
and
burials
that
had
occurred
in
it
together
with
recitals
of
congratulatory
verses
and
obituary
poetry
provoked
by
the
same
then
this
memory
would
recollect
that
one
of
these
events
occurred
during
the
celebrated
hard
winter
of
such
and
such
a
year
and
a
minute
description
of
that
winter
would
follow
along
with
the
names
of
people
who
were
frozen
to
death
and
statistics
showing
the
high
figures
which
pork
and
hay
went
up
to
pork
and
hay
would
suggest
corn
and
fodder
corn
and
fodder
would
suggest
cows
and
horses
cows
and
horses
would
suggest
the
circus
and
certain
celebrated
bare
back
riders
the
transition
from
the
circus
to
the
menagerie
was
easy
and
natural
from
the
elephant
to
equatorial
africa
was
but
a
step
then
of
course
the
heathen
savages
would
suggest
religion
and
at
the
end
of
three
or
four
hours
tedious
jaw
the
watch
would
change
and
brown
would
go
out
of
the
pilot
house
muttering
extracts
from
sermons
he
had
heard
years
before
about
the
efficacy
of
prayer
as
a
means
of
grace
and
the
original
first
mention
would
be
all
you
had
learned
about
that
dog
after
all
this
waiting
and
hungering
a
pilot
must
have
a
memory
but
there
are
two
higher
qualities
which
he
must
also
have
he
must
have
good
and
quick
judgment
and
decision
and
a
cool
calm
courage
that
no
peril
can
shake
give
a
man
the
merest
trifle
of
pluck
to
start
with
and
by
the
time
he
has
become
a
pilot
he
cannot
be
unmanned
by
any
danger
a
steamboat
can
get
into
but
one
cannot
quite
say
the
same
for
judgment
judgment
is
a
matter
of
brains
and
a
man
must
start
with
a
good
stock
of
that
article
or
he
will
never
succeed
as
a
pilot
the
growth
of
courage
in
the
pilot
house
is
steady
all
the
time
but
it
does
not
reach
a
high
and
satisfactory
condition
until
some
time
after
the
young
pilot
has
been
standing
his
own
watch
alone
and
under
the
staggering
weight
of
all
the
responsibilities
connected
with
the
position
when
an
apprentice
has
become
pretty
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
river
he
goes
clattering
along
so
fearlessly
with
his
steamboat
night
or
day
that
he
presently
begins
to
imagine
that
it
is
his
courage
that
animates
him
but
the
first
time
the
pilot
steps
out
and
leaves
him
to
his
own
devices
he
finds
out
it
was
the
other
man's
he
discovers
that
the
article
has
been
left
out
of
his
own
cargo
altogether
the
whole
river
is
bristling
with
exigencies
in
a
moment
he
is
not
prepared
for
them
he
does
not
know
how
to
meet
them
all
his
knowledge
forsakes
him
and
within
fifteen
minutes
he
is
as
white
as
a
sheet
and
scared
almost
to
death
therefore
pilots
wisely
train
these
cubs
by
various
strategic
tricks
to
look
danger
in
the
face
a
little
more
calmly
a
favorite
way
of
theirs
is
to
play
a
friendly
swindle
upon
the
candidate
mr
bixby
served
me
in
this
fashion
once
and
for
years
afterward
i
used
to
blush
even
in
my
sleep
when
i
thought
of
it
i
had
become
a
good
steersman
so
good
indeed
that
i
had
all
the
work
to
do
on
our
watch
night
and
day
mr
bixby
seldom
made
a
suggestion
to
me
all
he
ever
did
was
to
take
the
wheel
on
particularly
bad
nights
or
in
particularly
bad
crossings
land
the
boat
when
she
needed
to
be
landed
play
gentleman
of
leisure
nine
tenths
of
the
watch
and
collect
the
wages
the
lower
river
was
about
bank
full
and
if
anybody
had
questioned
my
ability
to
run
any
crossing
between
cairo
and
new
orleans
without
help
or
instruction
i
should
have
felt
irreparably
hurt
the
idea
of
being
afraid
of
any
crossing
in
the
lot
in
the
day
time
was
a
thing
too
preposterous
for
contemplation
well
one
matchless
summer's
day
i
was
bowling
down
the
bend
above
island
brimful
of
self
conceit
and
carrying
my
nose
as
high
as
a
giraffe's
when
mr
bixby
said
i
am
going
below
a
while
i
suppose
you
know
the
next
crossing
this
was
almost
an
affront
it
was
about
the
plainest
and
simplest
crossing
in
the
whole
river
one
couldn't
come
to
any
harm
whether
he
ran
it
right
or
not
and
as
for
depth
there
never
had
been
any
bottom
there
i
knew
all
this
perfectly
well
know
how
to
run
it
why
i
can
run
it
with
my
eyes
shut
how
much
water
is
there
in
it
well
that
is
an
odd
question
i
couldn't
get
bottom
there
with
a
church
steeple
you
think
so
do
you
the
very
tone
of
the
question
shook
my
confidence
that
was
what
mr
bixby
was
expecting
he
left
without
saying
anything
more
i
began
to
imagine
all
sorts
of
things
mr
bixby
unknown
to
me
of
course
sent
somebody
down
to
the
forecastle
with
some
mysterious
instructions
to
the
leadsmen
another
messenger
was
sent
to
whisper
among
the
officers
and
then
mr
bixby
went
into
hiding
behind
a
smoke
stack
where
he
could
observe
results
presently
the
captain
stepped
out
on
the
hurricane
deck
next
the
chief
mate
appeared
then
a
clerk
every
moment
or
two
a
straggler
was
added
to
my
audience
and
before
i
got
to
the
head
of
the
island
i
had
fifteen
or
twenty
people
assembled
down
there
under
my
nose
i
began
to
wonder
what
the
trouble
was
as
i
started
across
the
captain
glanced
aloft
at
me
and
said
with
a
sham
uneasiness
in
his
voice
where
is
mr
bixby
gone
below
sir
but
that
did
the
business
for
me
my
imagination
began
to
construct
dangers
out
of
nothing
and
they
multiplied
faster
than
i
could
keep
the
run
of
them
all
at
once
i
imagined
i
saw
shoal
water
ahead
the
wave
of
coward
agony
that
surged
through
me
then
came
near
dislocating
every
joint
in
me
all
my
confidence
in
that
crossing
vanished
i
seized
the
bell
rope
dropped
it
ashamed
seized
it
again
dropped
it
once
more
clutched
it
tremblingly
one
again
and
pulled
it
so
feebly
that
i
could
hardly
hear
the
stroke
myself
captain
and
mate
sang
out
instantly
and
both
together
starboard
lead
there
and
quick
about
it
this
was
another
shock
i
began
to
climb
the
wheel
like
a
squirrel
but
i
would
hardly
get
the
boat
started
to
port
before
i
would
see
new
dangers
on
that
side
and
away
i
would
spin
to
the
other
only
to
find
perils
accumulating
to
starboard
and
be
crazy
to
get
to
port
again
then
came
the
leadsman's
sepulchral
cry
d
e
e
p
four
deep
four
in
a
bottomless
crossing
the
terror
of
it
took
my
breath
away
m
a
r
k
three
m
a
r
k
three
quarter
less
three
half
twain
this
was
frightful
i
seized
the
bell
ropes
and
stopped
the
engines
quarter
twain
quarter
twain
mark
twain
i
was
helpless
i
did
not
know
what
in
the
world
to
do
i
was
quaking
from
head
to
foot
and
i
could
have
hung
my
hat
on
my
eyes
they
stuck
out
so
far
quarter
less
twain
nine
and
a
half
we
were
drawing
nine
my
hands
were
in
a
nerveless
flutter
i
could
not
ring
a
bell
intelligibly
with
them
i
flew
to
the
speaking
tube
and
shouted
to
the
engineer
oh
ben
if
you
love
me
back
her
quick
ben
oh
back
the
immortal
soul
out
of
her
i
heard
the
door
close
gently
i
looked
around
and
there
stood
mr
bixby
smiling
a
bland
sweet
smile
then
the
audience
on
the
hurricane
deck
sent
up
a
thundergust
of
humiliating
laughter
i
saw
it
all
now
and
i
felt
meaner
than
the
meanest
man
in
human
history
i
laid
in
the
lead
set
the
boat
in
her
marks
came
ahead
on
the
engines
and
said
it
was
a
fine
trick
to
play
on
an
orphan
wasn't
it
i
suppose
i'll
never
hear
the
last
of
how
i
was
ass
enough
to
heave
the
lead
at
the
head
of
well
no
you
won't
maybe
in
fact
i
hope
you
won't
for
i
want
you
to
learn
something
by
that
experience
didn't
you
know
there
was
no
bottom
in
that
crossing
yes
sir
i
did
very
well
then
you
shouldn't
have
allowed
me
or
anybody
else
to
shake
your
confidence
in
that
knowledge
try
to
remember
that
and
another
thing
when
you
get
into
a
dangerous
place
don't
turn
coward
that
isn't
going
to
help
matters
any
it
was
a
good
enough
lesson
but
pretty
hardly
learned
yet
about
the
hardest
part
of
it
was
that
for
months
i
so
often
had
to
hear
a
phrase
which
i
had
conceived
a
particular
distaste
for
it
was
oh
ben
if
you
love
me
back
her
chapter
rank
and
dignity
of
piloting
in
my
preceding
chapters
i
have
tried
by
going
into
the
minutiae
of
the
science
of
piloting
to
carry
the
reader
step
by
step
to
a
comprehension
of
what
the
science
consists
of
and
at
the
same
time
i
have
tried
to
show
him
that
it
is
a
very
curious
and
wonderful
science
too
and
very
worthy
of
his
attention
if
i
have
seemed
to
love
my
subject
it
is
no
surprising
thing
for
i
loved
the
profession
far
better
than
any
i
have
followed
since
and
i
took
a
measureless
pride
in
it
the
reason
is
plain
a
pilot
in
those
days
was
the
only
unfettered
and
entirely
independent
human
being
that
lived
in
the
earth
kings
are
but
the
hampered
servants
of
parliament
and
people
parliaments
sit
in
chains
forged
by
their
constituency
the
editor
of
a
newspaper
cannot
be
independent
but
must
work
with
one
hand
tied
behind
him
by
party
and
patrons
and
be
content
to
utter
only
half
or
two
thirds
of
his
mind
no
clergyman
is
a
free
man
and
may
speak
the
whole
truth
regardless
of
his
parish's
opinions
writers
of
all
kinds
are
manacled
servants
of
the
public
we
write
frankly
and
fearlessly
but
then
we
modify
before
we
print
in
truth
every
man
and
woman
and
child
has
a
master
and
worries
and
frets
in
servitude
but
in
the
day
i
write
of
the
mississippi
pilot
had
none
the
captain
could
stand
upon
the
hurricane
deck
in
the
pomp
of
a
very
brief
authority
and
give
him
five
or
six
orders
while
the
vessel
backed
into
the
stream
and
then
that
skipper's
reign
was
over
the
moment
that
the
boat
was
under
way
in
the
river
she
was
under
the
sole
and
unquestioned
control
of
the
pilot
he
could
do
with
her
exactly
as
he
pleased
run
her
when
and
whither
he
chose
and
tie
her
up
to
the
bank
whenever
his
judgment
said
that
that
course
was
best
his
movements
were
entirely
free
he
consulted
no
one
he
received
commands
from
nobody
he
promptly
resented
even
the
merest
suggestions
indeed
the
law
of
the
united
states
forbade
him
to
listen
to
commands
or
suggestions
rightly
considering
that
the
pilot
necessarily
knew
better
how
to
handle
the
boat
than
anybody
could
tell
him
so
here
was
the
novelty
of
a
king
without
a
keeper
an
absolute
monarch
who
was
absolute
in
sober
truth
and
not
by
a
fiction
of
words
i
have
seen
a
boy
of
eighteen
taking
a
great
steamer
serenely
into
what
seemed
almost
certain
destruction
and
the
aged
captain
standing
mutely
by
filled
with
apprehension
but
powerless
to
interfere
his
interference
in
that
particular
instance
might
have
been
an
excellent
thing
but
to
permit
it
would
have
been
to
establish
a
most
pernicious
precedent
it
will
easily
be
guessed
considering
the
pilot's
boundless
authority
that
he
was
a
great
personage
in
the
old
steamboating
days
he
was
treated
with
marked
courtesy
by
the
captain
and
with
marked
deference
by
all
the
officers
and
servants
and
this
deferential
spirit
was
quickly
communicated
to
the
passengers
too
i
think
pilots
were
about
the
only
people
i
ever
knew
who
failed
to
show
in
some
degree
embarrassment
in
the
presence
of
traveling
foreign
princes
but
then
people
in
one's
own
grade
of
life
are
not
usually
embarrassing
objects
by
long
habit
pilots
came
to
put
all
their
wishes
in
the
form
of
commands
it
gravels
me
to
this
day
to
put
my
will
in
the
weak
shape
of
a
request
instead
of
launching
it
in
the
crisp
language
of
an
order
in
those
old
days
to
load
a
steamboat
at
st
louis
take
her
to
new
orleans
and
back
and
discharge
cargo
consumed
about
twenty
five
days
on
an
average
seven
or
eight
of
these
days
the
boat
spent
at
the
wharves
of
st
louis
and
new
orleans
and
every
soul
on
board
was
hard
at
work
except
the
two
pilots
they
did
nothing
but
play
gentleman
up
town
and
receive
the
same
wages
for
it
as
if
they
had
been
on
duty
the
moment
the
boat
touched
the
wharf
at
either
city
they
were
ashore
and
they
were
not
likely
to
be
seen
again
till
the
last
bell
was
ringing
and
everything
in
readiness
for
another
voyage
when
a
captain
got
hold
of
a
pilot
of
particularly
high
reputation
he
took
pains
to
keep
him
when
wages
were
four
hundred
dollars
a
month
on
the
upper
mississippi
i
have
known
a
captain
to
keep
such
a
pilot
in
idleness
under
full
pay
three
months
at
a
time
while
the
river
was
frozen
up
and
one
must
remember
that
in
those
cheap
times
four
hundred
dollars
was
a
salary
of
almost
inconceivable
splendor
few
men
on
shore
got
such
pay
as
that
and
when
they
did
they
were
mightily
looked
up
to
when
pilots
from
either
end
of
the
river
wandered
into
our
small
missouri
village
they
were
sought
by
the
best
and
the
fairest
and
treated
with
exalted
respect
lying
in
port
under
wages
was
a
thing
which
many
pilots
greatly
enjoyed
and
appreciated
especially
if
they
belonged
in
the
missouri
river
in
the
heyday
of
that
trade
kansas
times
and
got
nine
hundred
dollars
a
trip
which
was
equivalent
to
about
eighteen
hundred
dollars
a
month
here
is
a
conversation
of
that
day
a
chap
out
of
the
illinois
river
with
a
little
stern
wheel
tub
accosts
a
couple
of
ornate
and
gilded
missouri
river
pilots
gentlemen
i've
got
a
pretty
good
trip
for
the
upcountry
and
shall
want
you
about
a
month
how
much
will
it
be
eighteen
hundred
dollars
apiece
heavens
and
earth
you
take
my
boat
let
me
have
your
wages
and
i'll
divide
i
will
remark
in
passing
that
mississippi
steamboatmen
were
important
in
landsmen's
eyes
and
in
their
own
too
in
a
degree
according
to
the
dignity
of
the
boat
they
were
on
for
instance
it
was
a
proud
thing
to
be
of
the
crew
of
such
stately
craft
as
the
aleck
scott
or
the
grand
turk
negro
firemen
deck
hands
and
barbers
belonging
to
those
boats
were
distinguished
personages
in
their
grade
of
life
and
they
were
well
aware
of
that
fact
too
a
stalwart
darkey
once
gave
offense
at
a
negro
ball
in
new
orleans
by
putting
on
a
good
many
airs
finally
one
of
the
managers
bustled
up
to
him
and
said
who
is
you
any
way
who
is
you
dat's
what
i
wants
to
know
the
offender
was
not
disconcerted
in
the
least
but
swelled
himself
up
and
threw
that
into
his
voice
which
showed
that
he
knew
he
was
not
putting
on
all
those
airs
on
a
stinted
capital

the
barber
of

a

young
negro

aired
his

with
balmy
complacency
and
was
greatly

the

evening
in
one
of
those
localities
a
middle
aged
negro
woman
projected
her

through

my
reference
a
moment
ago
to
the
fact
that
a
pilot's
peculiar
official
position
placed
him
out
of
the
reach
of
criticism
or
command
brings
stephen
w
naturally
to
my
mind
he
was
a
gifted
pilot
a
good
fellow
a
tireless
talker
and
had
both
wit
and
humor
in
him
he
had
a
most
irreverent
independence
too
and
was
deliciously
easy
going
and
comfortable
in
the
presence
of
age
official
dignity
and
even
the
most
august
wealth
he
always
had
work
he
never
saved
a
penny
he
was
a
most
persuasive
borrower
he
was
in
debt
to
every
pilot
on
the
river
and
to
the
majority
of
the
captains
he
could
throw
a
sort
of
splendor
around
a
bit
of
harum
scarum
devil
may
care
piloting
that
made
it
almost
fascinating
but
not
to
everybody
he
made
a
trip
with
good
old
captain
y
once
and
was
relieved
from
duty
when
the
boat
got
to
new
orleans
somebody
expressed
surprise
at
the
discharge
captain
y
shuddered
at
the
mere
mention
of
stephen
then
his
poor
thin
old
voice
piped
out
something
like
this
why
bless
me
i
wouldn't
have
such
a
wild
creature
on
my
boat
for
the
world
not
for
the
whole
world
he
swears
he
sings
he
whistles
he
yells
i
never
saw
such
an
injun
to
yell
all
times
of
the
night
it
never
made
any
difference
to
him
he
would
just
yell
that
way
not
for
anything
in
particular
but
merely
on
account
of
a
kind
of
devilish
comfort
he
got
out
of
it
i
never
could
get
into
a
sound
sleep
but
he
would
fetch
me
out
of
bed
all
in
a
cold
sweat
with
one
of
those
dreadful
war
whoops
a
queer
being
very
queer
being
no
respect
for
anything
or
anybody
sometimes
he
called
me
johnny
and
he
kept
a
fiddle
and
a
cat
he
played
execrably
this
seemed
to
distress
the
cat
and
so
the
cat
would
howl
nobody
could
sleep
where
that
man
and
his
family
was
and
reckless
there
never
was
anything
like
it
now
you
may
believe
it
or
not
but
as
sure
as
i
am
sitting
here
he
brought
my
boat
a
tilting
down
through
those
awful
snags
at
chicot
under
a
rattling
head
of
steam
and
the
wind
a
blowing
like
the
very
nation
at
that
my
officers
will
tell
you
so
they
saw
it
and
sir
while
he
was
a
tearing
right
down
through
those
snags
and
i
a
shaking
in
my
shoes
and
praying
i
wish
i
may
never
speak
again
if
he
didn't
pucker
up
his
mouth
and
go
to
whistling
yes
sir
whistling
buffalo
gals
can't
you
come
out
tonight
can't
you
come
out
to
night
can't
you
come
out
to
night
and
doing
it
as
calmly
as
if
we
were
attending
a
funeral
and
weren't
related
to
the
corpse
and
when
i
remonstrated
with
him
about
it
he
smiled
down
on
me
as
if
i
was
his
child
and
told
me
to
run
in
the
house
and
try
to
be
good
and
not
be
meddling
with
my
superiors
once
a
pretty
mean
captain
caught
stephen
in
new
orleans
out
of
work
and
as
usual
out
of
money
he
laid
steady
siege
to
stephen
who
was
in
a
very
close
place
and
finally
persuaded
him
to
hire
with
him
at
one
hundred
and
twenty
five
dollars
per
month
just
half
wages
the
captain
agreeing
not
to
divulge
the
secret
and
so
bring
down
the
contempt
of
all
the
guild
upon
the
poor
fellow
but
the
boat
was
not
more
than
a
day
out
of
new
orleans
before
stephen
discovered
that
the
captain
was
boasting
of
his
exploit
and
that
all
the
officers
had
been
told
stephen
winced
but
said
nothing
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
captain
stepped
out
on
the
hurricane
deck
cast
his
eye
around
and
looked
a
good
deal
surprised
he
glanced
inquiringly
aloft
at
stephen
but
stephen
was
whistling
placidly
and
attending
to
business
the
captain
stood
around
a
while
in
evident
discomfort
and
once
or
twice
seemed
about
to
make
a
suggestion
but
the
etiquette
of
the
river
taught
him
to
avoid
that
sort
of
rashness
and
so
he
managed
to
hold
his
peace
he
chafed
and
puzzled
a
few
minutes
longer
then
retired
to
his
apartments
but
soon
he
was
out
again
and
apparently
more
perplexed
than
ever
presently
he
ventured
to
remark
with
deference
pretty
good
stage
of
the
river
now
ain't
it
sir
well
i
should
say
so
bank
full
is
a
pretty
liberal
stage
seems
to
be
a
good
deal
of
current
here
good
deal
don't
describe
it
it's
worse
than
a
mill
race
isn't
it
easier
in
toward
shore
than
it
is
out
here
in
the
middle
yes
i
reckon
it
is
but
a
body
can't
be
too
careful
with
a
steamboat
it's
pretty
safe
out
here
can't
strike
any
bottom
here
you
can
depend
on
that
the
captain
departed
looking
rueful
enough
at
this
rate
he
would
probably
die
of
old
age
before
his
boat
got
to
st
louis
next
day
he
appeared
on
deck
and
again
found
stephen
faithfully
standing
up
the
middle
of
the
river
fighting
the
whole
vast
force
of
the
mississippi
and
whistling
the
same
placid
tune
this
thing
was
becoming
serious
in
by
the
shore
was
a
slower
boat
clipping
along
in
the
easy
water
and
gaining
steadily
she
began
to
make
for
an
island
chute
stephen
stuck
to
the
middle
of
the
river
speech
was
wrung
from
the
captain
he
said
mr
w
don't
that
chute
cut
off
a
good
deal
of
distance
i
think
it
does
but
i
don't
know
don't
know
well
isn't
there
water
enough
in
it
now
to
go
through
i
expect
there
is
but
i
am
not
certain
upon
my
word
this
is
odd
why
those
pilots
on
that
boat
yonder
are
going
to
try
it
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
don't
know
as
much
as
they
do
they
why
they
are
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollar
pilots
but
don't
you
be
uneasy
i
know
as
much
as
any
man
can
afford
to
know
for
a
hundred
and
twenty
five
the
captain
surrendered
five
minutes
later
stephen
was
bowling
through
the
chute
and
showing
the
rival
boat
a
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollar
pair
of
heels
chapter
the
pilots
monopoly
one
day
on
board
the
aleck
scott
my
chief
mr
bixby
was
crawling
carefully
through
a
close
place
at
cat
island
both
leads
going
and
everybody
holding
his
breath
the
captain
a
nervous
apprehensive
man
kept
still
as
long
as
he
could
but
finally
broke
down
and
shouted
from
the
hurricane
deck
for
gracious
sake
give
her
steam
mr
bixby
give
her
steam
she'll
never
raise
the
reef
on
this
headway
for
all
the
effect
that
was
produced
upon
mr
bixby
one
would
have
supposed
that
no
remark
had
been
made
but
five
minutes
later
when
the
danger
was
past
and
the
leads
laid
in
he
burst
instantly
into
a
consuming
fury
and
gave
the
captain
the
most
admirable
cursing
i
ever
listened
to
no
bloodshed
ensued
but
that
was
because
the
captain's
cause
was
weak
for
ordinarily
he
was
not
a
man
to
take
correction
quietly
having
now
set
forth
in
detail
the
nature
of
the
science
of
piloting
and
likewise
described
the
rank
which
the
pilot
held
among
the
fraternity
of
steamboatmen
this
seems
a
fitting
place
to
say
a
few
words
about
an
organization
which
the
pilots
once
formed
for
the
protection
of
their
guild
it
was
curious
and
noteworthy
in
this
that
it
was
perhaps
the
compactest
the
completest
and
the
strongest
commercial
organization
ever
formed
among
men
for
a
long
time
wages
had
been
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
month
but
curiously
enough
as
steamboats
multiplied
and
business
increased
the
wages
began
to
fall
little
by
little
it
was
easy
to
discover
the
reason
of
this
too
many
pilots
were
being
made
it
was
nice
to
have
a
cub
a
steersman
to
do
all
the
hard
work
for
a
couple
of
years
gratis
while
his
master
sat
on
a
high
bench
and
smoked
all
pilots
and
captains
had
sons
or
nephews
who
wanted
to
be
pilots
by
and
by
it
came
to
pass
that
nearly
every
pilot
on
the
river
had
a
steersman
when
a
steersman
had
made
an
amount
of
progress
that
was
satisfactory
to
any
two
pilots
in
the
trade
they
could
get
a
pilot's
license
for
him
by
signing
an
application
directed
to
the
united
states
inspector
nothing
further
was
needed
usually
no
questions
were
asked
no
proofs
of
capacity
required
very
well
this
growing
swarm
of
new
pilots
presently
began
to
undermine
the
wages
in
order
to
get
berths
too
late
apparently
the
knights
of
the
tiller
perceived
their
mistake
plainly
something
had
to
be
done
and
quickly
but
what
was
to
be
the
needful
thing
a
close
organization
nothing
else
would
answer
to
compass
this
seemed
an
impossibility
so
it
was
talked
and
talked
and
then
dropped
it
was
too
likely
to
ruin
whoever
ventured
to
move
in
the
matter
but
at
last
about
a
dozen
of
the
boldest
and
some
of
them
the
best
pilots
on
the
river
launched
themselves
into
the
enterprise
and
took
all
the
chances
they
got
a
special
charter
from
the
legislature
with
large
powers
under
the
name
of
the
pilots
benevolent
association
elected
their
officers
completed
their
organization
contributed
capital
put
association
wages
up
to
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
at
once
and
then
retired
to
their
homes
for
they
were
promptly
discharged
from
employment
but
there
were
two
or
three
unnoticed
trifles
in
their
by
laws
which
had
the
seeds
of
propagation
in
them
for
instance
all
idle
members
of
the
association
in
good
standing
were
entitled
to
a
pension
of
twenty
five
dollars
per
month
this
began
to
bring
in
one
straggler
after
another
from
the
ranks
of
the
new
fledged
pilots
in
the
dull
summer
season
better
have
twenty
five
dollars
than
starve
the
initiation
fee
was
only
twelve
dollars
and
no
dues
required
from
the
unemployed
also
the
widows
of
deceased
members
in
good
standing
could
draw
twenty
five
dollars
per
month
and
a
certain
sum
for
each
of
their
children
also
the
said
deceased
would
be
buried
at
the
association's
expense
these
things
resurrected
all
the
superannuated
and
forgotten
pilots
in
the
mississippi
valley
they
came
from
farms
they
came
from
interior
villages
they
came
from
everywhere
they
came
on
crutches
on
drays
in
ambulances
any
way
so
they
got
there
they
paid
in
their
twelve
dollars
and
straightway
began
to
draw
out
twenty
five
dollars
a
month
and
calculate
their
burial
bills
by
and
by
all
the
useless
helpless
pilots
and
a
dozen
first
class
ones
were
in
the
association
and
nine
tenths
of
the
best
pilots
out
of
it
and
laughing
at
it
it
was
the
laughing
stock
of
the
whole
river
everybody
joked
about
the
by
law
requiring
members
to
pay
ten
per
cent
of
their
wages
every
month
into
the
treasury
for
the
support
of
the
association
whereas
all
the
members
were
outcast
and
tabooed
and
no
one
would
employ
them
everybody
was
derisively
grateful
to
the
association
for
taking
all
the
worthless
pilots
out
of
the
way
and
leaving
the
whole
field
to
the
excellent
and
the
deserving
and
everybody
was
not
only
jocularly
grateful
for
that
but
for
a
result
which
naturally
followed
namely
the
gradual
advance
of
wages
as
the
busy
season
approached
wages
had
gone
up
from
the
low
figure
of
one
hundred
dollars
a
month
to
one
hundred
and
twenty
five
and
in
some
cases
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
and
it
was
great
fun
to
enlarge
upon
the
fact
that
this
charming
thing
had
been
accomplished
by
a
body
of
men
not
one
of
whom
received
a
particle
of
benefit
from
it
some
of
the
jokers
used
to
call
at
the
association
rooms
and
have
a
good
time
chaffing
the
members
and
offering
them
the
charity
of
taking
them
as
steersmen
for
a
trip
so
that
they
could
see
what
the
forgotten
river
looked
like
however
the
association
was
content
or
at
least
it
gave
no
sign
to
the
contrary
now
and
then
it
captured
a
pilot
who
was
out
of
luck
and
added
him
to
its
list
and
these
later
additions
were
very
valuable
for
they
were
good
pilots
the
incompetent
ones
had
all
been
absorbed
before
as
business
freshened
wages
climbed
gradually
up
to
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
the
association
figure
and
became
firmly
fixed
there
and
still
without
benefiting
a
member
of
that
body
for
no
member
was
hired
the
hilarity
at
the
association's
expense
burst
all
bounds
now
there
was
no
end
to
the
fun
which
that
poor
martyr
had
to
put
up
with
however
it
is
a
long
lane
that
has
no
turning
winter
approached
business
doubled
and
trebled
and
an
avalanche
of
missouri
illinois
and
upper
mississippi
river
boats
came
pouring
down
to
take
a
chance
in
the
new
orleans
trade
all
of
a
sudden
pilots
were
in
great
demand
and
were
correspondingly
scarce
the
time
for
revenge
was
come
it
was
a
bitter
pill
to
have
to
accept
association
pilots
at
last
yet
captains
and
owners
agreed
that
there
was
no
other
way
but
none
of
these
outcasts
offered
so
there
was
a
still
bitterer
pill
to
be
swallowed
they
must
be
sought
out
and
asked
for
their
services
captain
was
the
first
man
who
found
it
necessary
to
take
the
dose
and
he
had
been
the
loudest
derider
of
the
organization
he
hunted
up
one
of
the
best
of
the
association
pilots
and
said
well
you
boys
have
rather
got
the
best
of
us
for
a
little
while
so
i'll
give
in
with
as
good
a
grace
as
i
can
i've
come
to
hire
you
get
your
trunk
aboard
right
away
i
want
to
leave
at
twelve
o'clock
i
don't
know
about
that
who
is
your
other
pilot
i've
got
i
s
why
i
can't
go
with
him
he
don't
belong
to
the
association
what
it's
so
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
won't
turn
a
wheel
with
one
of
the
very
best
and
oldest
pilots
on
the
river
because
he
don't
belong
to
your
association
yes
i
do
well
if
this
isn't
putting
on
airs
i
supposed
i
was
doing
you
a
benevolence
but
i
begin
to
think
that
i
am
the
party
that
wants
a
favor
done
are
you
acting
under
a
law
of
the
concern
yes
show
it
to
me
so
they
stepped
into
the
association
rooms
and
the
secretary
soon
satisfied
the
captain
who
said
well
what
am
i
to
do
i
have
hired
mr
s
for
the
entire
season
i
will
provide
for
you
said
the
secretary
i
will
detail
a
pilot
to
go
with
you
and
he
shall
be
on
board
at
twelve
o'clock
but
if
i
discharge
s
he
will
come
on
me
for
the
whole
season's
wages
of
course
that
is
a
matter
between
you
and
mr
s
captain
we
cannot
meddle
in
your
private
affairs
the
captain
stormed
but
to
no
purpose
in
the
end
he
had
to
discharge
s
pay
him
about
a
thousand
dollars
and
take
an
association
pilot
in
his
place
the
laugh
was
beginning
to
turn
the
other
way
now
every
day
thenceforward
a
new
victim
fell
every
day
some
outraged
captain
discharged
a
non
association
pet
with
tears
and
profanity
and
installed
a
hated
association
man
in
his
berth
in
a
very
little
while
idle
non
associationists
began
to
be
pretty
plenty
brisk
as
business
was
and
much
as
their
services
were
desired
the
laugh
was
shifting
to
the
other
side
of
their
mouths
most
palpably
these
victims
together
with
the
captains
and
owners
presently
ceased
to
laugh
altogether
and
began
to
rage
about
the
revenge
they
would
take
when
the
passing
business
spurt
was
over
soon
all
the
laughers
that
were
left
were
the
owners
and
crews
of
boats
that
had
two
non
association
pilots
but
their
triumph
was
not
very
long
lived
for
this
reason
it
was
a
rigid
rule
of
the
association
that
its
members
should
never
under
any
circumstances
whatever
give
information
about
the
channel
to
any
outsider
by
this
time
about
half
the
boats
had
none
but
association
pilots
and
the
other
half
had
none
but
outsiders
at
the
first
glance
one
would
suppose
that
when
it
came
to
forbidding
information
about
the
river
these
two
parties
could
play
equally
at
that
game
but
this
was
not
so
at
every
good
sized
town
from
one
end
of
the
river
to
the
other
there
was
a
wharf
boat
to
land
at
instead
of
a
wharf
or
a
pier
freight
was
stored
in
it
for
transportation
waiting
passengers
slept
in
its
cabins
upon
each
of
these
wharf
boats
the
association's
officers
placed
a
strong
box
fastened
with
a
peculiar
lock
which
was
used
in
no
other
service
but
one
the
united
states
mail
service
it
was
the
letter
bag
lock
a
sacred
governmental
thing
by
dint
of
much
beseeching
the
government
had
been
persuaded
to
allow
the
association
to
use
this
lock
every
association
man
carried
a
key
which
would
open
these
boxes
that
key
or
rather
a
peculiar
way
of
holding
it
in
the
hand
when
its
owner
was
asked
for
river
information
by
a
stranger
for
the
success
of
the
st
louis
and
new
orleans
association
had
now
bred
tolerably
thriving
branches
in
a
dozen
neighboring
steamboat
trades
was
the
association
man's
sign
and
diploma
of
membership
and
if
the
stranger
did
not
respond
by
producing
a
similar
key
and
holding
it
in
a
certain
manner
duly
prescribed
his
question
was
politely
ignored
from
the
association's
secretary
each
member
received
a
package
of
more
or
less
gorgeous
blanks
printed
like
a
billhead
on
handsome
paper
properly
ruled
in
columns
a
bill
head
worded
something
like
this
these
blanks
were
filled
up
day
by
day
as
the
voyage
progressed
and
deposited
in
the
several
wharf
boat
boxes
for
instance
as
soon
as
the
first
crossing
out
from
st
louis
was
completed
the
items
would
be
entered
upon
the
blank
under
the
appropriate
headings
thus
st
louis
nine
and
a
half
feet
stern
on
court
house
head
on
dead
cottonwood
above
wood
yard
until
you
raise
the
first
reef
then
pull
up
square
then
under
head
of
remarks
go
just
outside
the
wrecks
this
is
important
new
snag
just
where
you
straighten
down
go
above
it
the
pilot
who
deposited
that
blank
in
the
cairo
box
after
adding
to
it
the
details
of
every
crossing
all
the
way
down
from
st
louis
took
out
and
read
half
a
dozen
fresh
reports
from
upward
bound
steamers
concerning
the
river
between
cairo
and
memphis
posted
himself
thoroughly
returned
them
to
the
box
and
went
back
aboard
his
boat
again
so
armed
against
accident
that
he
could
not
possibly
get
his
boat
into
trouble
without
bringing
the
most
ingenious
carelessness
to
his
aid
imagine
the
benefits
of
so
admirable
a
system
in
a
piece
of
river
twelve
or
thirteen
hundred
miles
long
whose
channel
was
shifting
every
day
the
pilot
who
had
formerly
been
obliged
to
put
up
with
seeing
a
shoal
place
once
or
possibly
twice
a
month
had
a
hundred
sharp
eyes
to
watch
it
for
him
now
and
bushels
of
intelligent
brains
to
tell
him
how
to
run
it
his
information
about
it
was
seldom
twenty
four
hours
old
if
the
reports
in
the
last
box
chanced
to
leave
any
misgivings
on
his
mind
concerning
a
treacherous
crossing
he
had
his
remedy
he
blew
his
steam
whistle
in
a
peculiar
way
as
soon
as
he
saw
a
boat
approaching
the
signal
was
answered
in
a
peculiar
way
if
that
boat's
pilots
were
association
men
and
then
the
two
steamers
ranged
alongside
and
all
uncertainties
were
swept
away
by
fresh
information
furnished
to
the
inquirer
by
word
of
mouth
and
in
minute
detail
the
first
thing
a
pilot
did
when
he
reached
new
orleans
or
st
louis
was
to
take
his
final
and
elaborate
report
to
the
association
parlors
and
hang
it
up
there
after
which
he
was
free
to
visit
his
family
in
these
parlors
a
crowd
was
always
gathered
together
discussing
changes
in
the
channel
and
the
moment
there
was
a
fresh
arrival
everybody
stopped
talking
till
this
witness
had
told
the
newest
news
and
settled
the
latest
uncertainty
other
craftsmen
can
sink
the
shop
sometimes
and
interest
themselves
in
other
matters
not
so
with
a
pilot
he
must
devote
himself
wholly
to
his
profession
and
talk
of
nothing
else
for
it
would
be
small
gain
to
be
perfect
one
day
and
imperfect
the
next
he
has
no
time
or
words
to
waste
if
he
would
keep
posted
but
the
outsiders
had
a
hard
time
of
it
no
particular
place
to
meet
and
exchange
information
no
wharf
boat
reports
none
but
chance
and
unsatisfactory
ways
of
getting
news
the
consequence
was
that
a
man
sometimes
had
to
run
five
hundred
miles
of
river
on
information
that
was
a
week
or
ten
days
old
at
a
fair
stage
of
the
river
that
might
have
answered
but
when
the
dead
low
water
came
it
was
destructive
now
came
another
perfectly
logical
result
the
outsiders
began
to
ground
steamboats
sink
them
and
get
into
all
sorts
of
trouble
whereas
accidents
seemed
to
keep
entirely
away
from
the
association
men
wherefore
even
the
owners
and
captains
of
boats
furnished
exclusively
with
outsiders
and
previously
considered
to
be
wholly
independent
of
the
association
and
free
to
comfort
themselves
with
brag
and
laughter
began
to
feel
pretty
uncomfortable
still
they
made
a
show
of
keeping
up
the
brag
until
one
black
day
when
every
captain
of
the
lot
was
formally
ordered
to
immediately
discharge
his
outsiders
and
take
association
pilots
in
their
stead
and
who
was
it
that
had
the
dashing
presumption
to
do
that
alas
it
came
from
a
power
behind
the
throne
that
was
greater
than
the
throne
itself
it
was
the
underwriters
it
was
no
time
to
swap
knives
every
outsider
had
to
take
his
trunk
ashore
at
once
of
course
it
was
supposed
that
there
was
collusion
between
the
association
and
the
underwriters
but
this
was
not
so
the
latter
had
come
to
comprehend
the
excellence
of
the
report
system
of
the
association
and
the
safety
it
secured
and
so
they
had
made
their
decision
among
themselves
and
upon
plain
business
principles
there
was
weeping
and
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
in
the
camp
of
the
outsiders
now
but
no
matter
there
was
but
one
course
for
them
to
pursue
and
they
pursued
it
they
came
forward
in
couples
and
groups
and
proffered
their
twelve
dollars
and
asked
for
membership
they
were
surprised
to
learn
that
several
new
by
laws
had
been
long
ago
added
for
instance
the
initiation
fee
had
been
raised
to
fifty
dollars
that
sum
must
be
tendered
and
also
ten
per
cent
of
the
wages
which
the
applicant
had
received
each
and
every
month
since
the
founding
of
the
association
in
many
cases
this
amounted
to
three
or
four
hundred
dollars
still
the
association
would
not
entertain
the
application
until
the
money
was
present
even
then
a
single
adverse
vote
killed
the
application
every
member
had
to
vote
yes
or
no
in
person
and
before
witnesses
so
it
took
weeks
to
decide
a
candidacy
because
many
pilots
were
so
long
absent
on
voyages
however
the
repentant
sinners
scraped
their
savings
together
and
one
by
one
by
our
tedious
voting
process
they
were
added
to
the
fold
a
time
came
at
last
when
only
about
ten
remained
outside
they
said
they
would
starve
before
they
would
apply
they
remained
idle
a
long
while
because
of
course
nobody
could
venture
to
employ
them
by
and
by
the
association
published
the
fact
that
upon
a
certain
date
the
wages
would
be
raised
to
five
hundred
dollars
per
month
all
the
branch
associations
had
grown
strong
now
and
the
red
river
one
had
advanced
wages
to
seven
hundred
dollars
a
month
reluctantly
the
ten
outsiders
yielded
in
view
of
these
things
and
made
application
there
was
another
new
by
law
by
this
time
which
required
them
to
pay
dues
not
only
on
all
the
wages
they
had
received
since
the
association
was
born
but
also
on
what
they
would
have
received
if
they
had
continued
at
work
up
to
the
time
of
their
application
instead
of
going
off
to
pout
in
idleness
it
turned
out
to
be
a
difficult
matter
to
elect
them
but
it
was
accomplished
at
last
the
most
virulent
sinner
of
this
batch
had
stayed
out
and
allowed
dues
to
accumulate
against
him
so
long
that
he
had
to
send
in
six
hundred
and
twenty
five
dollars
with
his
application
the
association
had
a
good
bank
account
now
and
was
very
strong
there
was
no
longer
an
outsider
a
by
law
was
added
forbidding
the
reception
of
any
more
cubs
or
apprentices
for
five
years
after
which
time
a
limited
number
would
be
taken
not
by
individuals
but
by
the
association
upon
these
terms
the
applicant
must
not
be
less
than
eighteen
years
old
and
of
respectable
family
and
good
character
he
must
pass
an
examination
as
to
education
pay
a
thousand
dollars
in
advance
for
the
privilege
of
becoming
an
apprentice
and
must
remain
under
the
commands
of
the
association
until
a
great
part
of
the
membership
more
than
half
i
think
should
be
willing
to
sign
his
application
for
a
pilot's
license
all
previously
articled
apprentices
were
now
taken
away
from
their
masters
and
adopted
by
the
association
the
president
and
secretary
detailed
them
for
service
on
one
boat
or
another
as
they
chose
and
changed
them
from
boat
to
boat
according
to
certain
rules
if
a
pilot
could
show
that
he
was
in
infirm
health
and
needed
assistance
one
of
the
cubs
would
be
ordered
to
go
with
him
the
widow
and
orphan
list
grew
but
so
did
the
association's
financial
resources
the
association
attended
its
own
funerals
in
state
and
paid
for
them
when
occasion
demanded
it
sent
members
down
the
river
upon
searches
for
the
bodies
of
brethren
lost
by
steamboat
accidents
a
search
of
this
kind
sometimes
cost
a
thousand
dollars
the
association
procured
a
charter
and
went
into
the
insurance
business
also
it
not
only
insured
the
lives
of
its
members
but
took
risks
on
steamboats
the
organization
seemed
indestructible
it
was
the
tightest
monopoly
in
the
world
by
the
united
states
law
no
man
could
become
a
pilot
unless
two
duly
licensed
pilots
signed
his
application
and
now
there
was
nobody
outside
of
the
association
competent
to
sign
consequently
the
making
of
pilots
was
at
an
end
every
year
some
would
die
and
others
become
incapacitated
by
age
and
infirmity
there
would
be
no
new
ones
to
take
their
places
in
time
the
association
could
put
wages
up
to
any
figure
it
chose
and
as
long
as
it
should
be
wise
enough
not
to
carry
the
thing
too
far
and
provoke
the
national
government
into
amending
the
licensing
system
steamboat
owners
would
have
to
submit
since
there
would
be
no
help
for
it
the
owners
and
captains
were
the
only
obstruction
that
lay
between
the
association
and
absolute
power
and
at
last
this
one
was
removed
incredible
as
it
may
seem
the
owners
and
captains
deliberately
did
it
themselves
when
the
pilots
association
announced
months
beforehand
that
on
the
first
day
of
september
wages
would
be
advanced
to
five
hundred
dollars
per
month
the
owners
and
captains
instantly
put
freights
up
a
few
cents
and
explained
to
the
farmers
along
the
river
the
necessity
of
it
by
calling
their
attention
to
the
burdensome
rate
of
wages
about
to
be
established
it
was
a
rather
slender
argument
but
the
farmers
did
not
seem
to
detect
it
it
looked
reasonable
to
them
that
to
add
five
cents
freight
on
a
bushel
of
corn
was
justifiable
under
the
circumstances
overlooking
the
fact
that
this
advance
on
a
cargo
of
forty
thousand
sacks
was
a
good
deal
more
than
necessary
to
cover
the
new
wages
so
straightway
the
captains
and
owners
got
up
an
association
of
their
own
and
proposed
to
put
captains
wages
up
to
five
hundred
dollars
too
and
move
for
another
advance
in
freights
it
was
a
novel
idea
but
of
course
an
effect
which
had
been
produced
once
could
be
produced
again
the
new
association
decreed
for
this
was
before
all
the
outsiders
had
been
taken
into
the
pilots
association
that
if
any
captain
employed
a
non
association
pilot
he
should
be
forced
to
discharge
him
and
also
pay
a
fine
of
five
hundred
dollars
several
of
these
heavy
fines
were
paid
before
the
captains
organization
grew
strong
enough
to
exercise
full
authority
over
its
membership
but
that
all
ceased
presently
the
captains
tried
to
get
the
pilots
to
decree
that
no
member
of
their
corporation
should
serve
under
a
non
association
captain
but
this
proposition
was
declined
the
pilots
saw
that
they
would
be
backed
up
by
the
captains
and
the
underwriters
anyhow
and
so
they
wisely
refrained
from
entering
into
entangling
alliances
as
i
have
remarked
the
pilots
association
was
now
the
compactest
monopoly
in
the
world
perhaps
and
seemed
simply
indestructible
and
yet
the
days
of
its
glory
were
numbered
first
the
new
railroad
stretching
up
through
mississippi
tennessee
and
kentucky
to
northern
railway
centers
began
to
divert
the
passenger
travel
from
the
steamers
next
the
war
came
and
almost
entirely
annihilated
the
steamboating
industry
during
several
years
leaving
most
of
the
pilots
idle
and
the
cost
of
living
advancing
all
the
time
then
the
treasurer
of
the
st
louis
association
put
his
hand
into
the
till
and
walked
off
with
every
dollar
of
the
ample
fund
and
finally
the
railroads
intruding
everywhere
there
was
little
for
steamers
to
do
when
the
war
was
over
but
carry
freights
so
straightway
some
genius
from
the
atlantic
coast
introduced
the
plan
of
towing
a
dozen
steamer
cargoes
down
to
new
orleans
at
the
tail
of
a
vulgar
little
tug
boat
and
behold
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
as
it
were
the
association
and
the
noble
science
of
piloting
were
things
of
the
dead
and
pathetic
past
chapter
racing
days
it
was
always
the
custom
for
the
boats
to
leave
new
orleans
between
four
and
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
from
three
o'clock
onward
they
would
be
burning
rosin
and
pitch
pine
the
sign
of
preparation
and
so
one
had
the
picturesque
spectacle
of
a
rank
some
two
or
three
miles
long
of
tall
ascending
columns
of
coal
black
smoke
a
colonnade
which
supported
a
sable
roof
of
the
same
smoke
blended
together
and
spreading
abroad
over
the
city
every
outward
bound
boat
had
its
flag
flying
at
the
jack
staff
and
sometimes
a
duplicate
on
the
verge
staff
astern
two
or
three
miles
of
mates
were
commanding
and
swearing
with
more
than
usual
emphasis
countless
processions
of
freight
barrels
and
boxes
were
spinning
athwart
the
levee
and
flying
aboard
the
stage
planks
belated
passengers
were
dodging
and
skipping
among
these
frantic
things
hoping
to
reach
the
forecastle
companion
way
alive
but
having
their
doubts
about
it
women
with
reticules
and
bandboxes
were
trying
to
keep
up
with
husbands
freighted
with
carpet
sacks
and
crying
babies
and
making
a
failure
of
it
by
losing
their
heads
in
the
whirl
and
roar
and
general
distraction
drays
and
baggage
vans
were
clattering
hither
and
thither
in
a
wild
hurry
every
now
and
then
getting
blocked
and
jammed
together
and
then
during
ten
seconds
one
could
not
see
them
for
the
profanity
except
vaguely
and
dimly
every
windlass
connected
with
every
forehatch
from
one
end
of
that
long
array
of
steamboats
to
the
other
was
keeping
up
a
deafening
whiz
and
whir
lowering
freight
into
the
hold
and
the
half
naked
crews
of
perspiring
negroes
that
worked
them
were
roaring
such
songs
as
de
las
sack
de
las
sack
inspired
to
unimaginable
exaltation
by
the
chaos
of
turmoil
and
racket
that
was
driving
everybody
else
mad
by
this
time
the
hurricane
and
boiler
decks
of
the
steamers
would
be
packed
and
black
with
passengers
the
last
bells
would
begin
to
clang
all
down
the
line
and
then
the
powwow
seemed
to
double
in
a
moment
or
two
the
final
warning
came
a
simultaneous
din
of
chinese
gongs
with
the
cry
all
dat
ain't
goin
please
to
git
asho
and
behold
the
powwow
quadrupled
people
came
swarming
ashore
overturning
excited
stragglers
that
were
trying
to
swarm
aboard
one
more
moment
later
a
long
array
of
stage
planks
was
being
hauled
in
each
with
its
customary
latest
passenger
clinging
to
the
end
of
it
with
teeth
nails
and
everything
else
and
the
customary
latest
procrastinator
making
a
wild
spring
shoreward
over
his
head
now
a
number
of
the
boats
slide
backward
into
the
stream
leaving
wide
gaps
in
the
serried
rank
of
steamers
citizens
crowd
the
decks
of
boats
that
are
not
to
go
in
order
to
see
the
sight
steamer
after
steamer
straightens
herself
up
gathers
all
her
strength
and
presently
comes
swinging
by
under
a
tremendous
head
of
steam
with
flag
flying
black
smoke
rolling
and
her
entire
crew
of
firemen
and
deck
hands
usually
swarthy
negroes
massed
together
on
the
forecastle
the
best
voice
in
the
lot
towering
from
the
midst
being
mounted
on
the
capstan
waving
his
hat
or
a
flag
and
all
roaring
a
mighty
chorus
while
the
parting
cannons
boom
and
the
multitudinous
spectators
swing
their
hats
and
huzza
steamer
after
steamer
falls
into
line
and
the
stately
procession
goes
winging
its
flight
up
the
river
in
the
old
times
whenever
two
fast
boats
started
out
on
a
race
with
a
big
crowd
of
people
looking
on
it
was
inspiring
to
hear
the
crews
sing
especially
if
the
time
were
night
fall
and
the
forecastle
lit
up
with
the
red
glare
of
the
torch
baskets
racing
was
royal
fun
the
public
always
had
an
idea
that
racing
was
dangerous
whereas
the
opposite
was
the
case
that
is
after
the
laws
were
passed
which
restricted
each
boat
to
just
so
many
pounds
of
steam
to
the
square
inch
no
engineer
was
ever
sleepy
or
careless
when
his
heart
was
in
a
race
he
was
constantly
on
the
alert
trying
gauge
cocks
and
watching
things
the
dangerous
place
was
on
slow
plodding
boats
where
the
engineers
drowsed
around
and
allowed
chips
to
get
into
the
doctor
and
shut
off
the
water
supply
from
the
boilers
in
the
flush
times
of
steamboating
a
race
between
two
notoriously
fleet
steamers
was
an
event
of
vast
importance
the
date
was
set
for
it
several
weeks
in
advance
and
from
that
time
forward
the
whole
mississippi
valley
was
in
a
state
of
consuming
excitement
politics
and
the
weather
were
dropped
and
people
talked
only
of
the
coming
race
as
the
time
approached
the
two
steamers
stripped
and
got
ready
every
encumbrance
that
added
weight
or
exposed
a
resisting
surface
to
wind
or
water
was
removed
if
the
boat
could
possibly
do
without
it
the
spars
and
sometimes
even
their
supporting
derricks
were
sent
ashore
and
no
means
left
to
set
the
boat
afloat
in
case
she
got
aground
when
the
eclipse
and
the
a
l
shotwell
ran
their
great
race
many
years
ago
it
was
said
that
pains
were
taken
to
scrape
the
gilding
off
the
fanciful
device
which
hung
between
the
eclipse's
chimneys
and
that
for
that
one
trip
the
captain
left
off
his
kid
gloves
and
had
his
head
shaved
but
i
always
doubted
these
things
if
the
boat
was
known
to
make
her
best
speed
when
drawing
five
and
a
half
feet
forward
and
five
feet
aft
she
was
carefully
loaded
to
that
exact
figure
she
wouldn't
enter
a
dose
of
homoeopathic
pills
on
her
manifest
after
that
hardly
any
passengers
were
taken
because
they
not
only
add
weight
but
they
never
will
trim
boat
they
always
run
to
the
side
when
there
is
anything
to
see
whereas
a
conscientious
and
experienced
steamboatman
would
stick
to
the
center
of
the
boat
and
part
his
hair
in
the
middle
with
a
spirit
level
no
way
freights
and
no
way
passengers
were
allowed
for
the
racers
would
stop
only
at
the
largest
towns
and
then
it
would
be
only
touch
and
go
coal
flats
and
wood
flats
were
contracted
for
beforehand
and
these
were
kept
ready
to
hitch
on
to
the
flying
steamers
at
a
moment's
warning
double
crews
were
carried
so
that
all
work
could
be
quickly
done
the
chosen
date
being
come
and
all
things
in
readiness
the
two
great
steamers
back
into
the
stream
and
lie
there
jockeying
a
moment
and
apparently
watching
each
other's
slightest
movement
like
sentient
creatures
flags
drooping
the
pent
steam
shrieking
through
safety
valves
the
black
smoke
rolling
and
tumbling
from
the
chimneys
and
darkening
all
the
air
people
people
everywhere
the
shores
the
house
tops
the
steamboats
the
ships
are
packed
with
them
and
you
know
that
the
borders
of
the
broad
mississippi
are
going
to
be
fringed
with
humanity
thence
northward
twelve
hundred
miles
to
welcome
these
racers
presently
tall
columns
of
steam
burst
from
the
scape
pipes
of
both
steamers
two
guns
boom
a
good
bye
two
red
shirted
heroes
mounted
on
capstans
wave
their
small
flags
above
the
massed
crews
on
the
forecastles
two
plaintive
solos
linger
on
the
air
a
few
waiting
seconds
two
mighty
choruses
burst
forth
and
here
they
come
brass
bands
bray
hail
columbia
huzza
after
huzza
thunders
from
the
shores
and
the
stately
creatures
go
whistling
by
like
the
wind
those
boats
will
never
halt
a
moment
between
new
orleans
and
st
louis
except
for
a
second
or
two
at
large
towns
or
to
hitch
thirty
cord
wood
boats
alongside
you
should
be
on
board
when
they
take
a
couple
of
those
wood
boats
in
tow
and
turn
a
swarm
of
men
into
each
by
the
time
you
have
wiped
your
glasses
and
put
them
on
you
will
be
wondering
what
has
become
of
that
wood
two
nicely
matched
steamers
will
stay
in
sight
of
each
other
day
after
day
they
might
even
stay
side
by
side
but
for
the
fact
that
pilots
are
not
all
alike
and
the
smartest
pilots
will
win
the
race
if
one
of
the
boats
has
a
lightning
pilot
whose
partner
is
a
trifle
his
inferior
you
can
tell
which
one
is
on
watch
by
noting
whether
that
boat
has
gained
ground
or
lost
some
during
each
four
hour
stretch
the
shrewdest
pilot
can
delay
a
boat
if
he
has
not
a
fine
genius
for
steering
steering
is
a
very
high
art
one
must
not
keep
a
rudder
dragging
across
a
boat's
stem
if
he
wants
to
get
up
the
river
fast
there
is
a
great
difference
in
boats
of
course
for
a
long
time
i
was
on
a
boat
that
was
so
slow
we
used
to
forget
what
year
it
was
we
left
port
in
but
of
course
this
was
at
rare
intervals
ferryboats
used
to
lose
valuable
trips
because
their
passengers
grew
old
and
died
waiting
for
us
to
get
by
this
was
at
still
rarer
intervals
i
had
the
documents
for
these
occurrences
but
through
carelessness
they
have
been
mislaid
this
boat
the
john
j
roe
was
so
slow
that
when
she
finally
sunk
in
madrid
bend
it
was
five
years
before
the
owners
heard
of
it
that
was
always
a
confusing
fact
to
me
but
it
is
according
to
the
record
any
way
she
was
dismally
slow
still
we
often
had
pretty
exciting
times
racing
with
islands
and
rafts
and
such
things
one
trip
however
we
did
rather
well
we
went
to
st
louis
in
sixteen
days
but
even
at
this
rattling
gait
i
think
we
changed
watches
three
times
in
fort
adams
reach
which
is
five
miles
long
a
reach
is
a
piece
of
straight
river
and
of
course
the
current
drives
through
such
a
place
in
a
pretty
lively
way
that
trip
we
went
to
grand
gulf
from
new
orleans
in
four
days
three
hundred
and
forty
miles
the
eclipse
and
shotwell
did
it
in
one
we
were
nine
days
out
in
the
chute
of
seven
hundred
miles
the
eclipse
and
shotwell
went
there
in
two
days
something
over
a
generation
ago
a
boat
called
the
j
m
white
went
from
new
orleans
to
cairo
in
three
days
six
hours
and
forty
four
minutes
in
the
eclipse
made
the
same
trip
in
three
days
three
hours
and
twenty
minutes
footnote
disputed
some
authorities
add
hour
and
minutes
to
this
in
the
r
e
lee
did
it
in
three
days
and
one
hour
this
last
is
called
the
fastest
trip
on
record
i
will
try
to
show
that
it
was
not
for
this
reason
the
distance
between
new
orleans
and
cairo
when
the
j
m
white
ran
it
was
about
eleven
hundred
and
six
miles
consequently
her
average
speed
was
a
trifle
over
fourteen
miles
per
hour
in
the
eclipse's
day
the
distance
between
the
two
ports
had
become
reduced
to
one
thousand
and
eighty
miles
consequently
her
average
speed
was
a
shade
under
fourteen
and
three
eighths
miles
per
hour
in
the
r
e
lee's
time
the
distance
had
diminished
to
about
one
thousand
and
thirty
miles
consequently
her
average
was
about
fourteen
and
one
eighth
miles
per
hour
therefore
the
eclipse's
was
conspicuously
the
fastest
time
that
has
ever
been
made
chapter
cut
offs
and
stephen
these
dry
details
are
of
importance
in
one
particular
they
give
me
an
opportunity
of
introducing
one
of
the
mississippi's
oddest
peculiarities
that
of
shortening
its
length
from
time
to
time
if
you
will
throw
a
long
pliant
apple
paring
over
your
shoulder
it
will
pretty
fairly
shape
itself
into
an
average
section
of
the
mississippi
river
that
is
the
nine
or
ten
hundred
miles
stretching
from
cairo
illinois
southward
to
new
orleans
the
same
being
wonderfully
crooked
with
a
brief
straight
bit
here
and
there
at
wide
intervals
the
two
hundred
mile
stretch
from
cairo
northward
to
st
louis
is
by
no
means
so
crooked
that
being
a
rocky
country
which
the
river
cannot
cut
much
the
water
cuts
the
alluvial
banks
of
the
lower
river
into
deep
horseshoe
curves
so
deep
indeed
that
in
some
places
if
you
were
to
get
ashore
at
one
extremity
of
the
horseshoe
and
walk
across
the
neck
half
or
three
quarters
of
a
mile
you
could
sit
down
and
rest
a
couple
of
hours
while
your
steamer
was
coming
around
the
long
elbow
at
a
speed
of
ten
miles
an
hour
to
take
you
aboard
again
when
the
river
is
rising
fast
some
scoundrel
whose
plantation
is
back
in
the
country
and
therefore
of
inferior
value
has
only
to
watch
his
chance
cut
a
little
gutter
across
the
narrow
neck
of
land
some
dark
night
and
turn
the
water
into
it
and
in
a
wonderfully
short
time
a
miracle
has
happened
to
wit
the
whole
mississippi
has
taken
possession
of
that
little
ditch
and
placed
the
countryman's
plantation
on
its
bank
quadrupling
its
value
and
that
other
party's
formerly
valuable
plantation
finds
itself
away
out
yonder
on
a
big
island
the
old
watercourse
around
it
will
soon
shoal
up
boats
cannot
approach
within
ten
miles
of
it
and
down
goes
its
value
to
a
fourth
of
its
former
worth
watches
are
kept
on
those
narrow
necks
at
needful
times
and
if
a
man
happens
to
be
caught
cutting
a
ditch
across
them
the
chances
are
all
against
his
ever
having
another
opportunity
to
cut
a
ditch
pray
observe
some
of
the
effects
of
this
ditching
business
once
there
was
a
neck
opposite
port
hudson
louisiana
which
was
only
half
a
mile
across
in
its
narrowest
place
you
could
walk
across
there
in
fifteen
minutes
but
if
you
made
the
journey
around
the
cape
on
a
raft
you
traveled
thirty
five
miles
to
accomplish
the
same
thing
in
the
river
darted
through
that
neck
deserted
its
old
bed
and
thus
shortened
itself
thirty
five
miles
in
the
same
way
it
shortened
itself
twenty
five
miles
at
black
hawk
point
in
below
red
river
landing
raccourci
cut
off
was
made
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
i
think
this
shortened
the
river
twenty
eight
miles
in
our
day
if
you
travel
by
river
from
the
southernmost
of
these
three
cut
offs
to
the
northernmost
you
go
only
seventy
miles
to
do
the
same
thing
a
hundred
and
seventy
six
years
ago
one
had
to
go
a
hundred
and
fifty
eight
miles
shortening
of
eighty
eight
miles
in
that
trifling
distance
at
some
forgotten
time
in
the
past
cut
offs
were
made
above
vidalia
louisiana
at
island
at
island
and
at
hale's
point
these
shortened
the
river
in
the
aggregate
seventy
seven
miles
since
my
own
day
on
the
mississippi
cut
offs
have
been
made
at
hurricane
island
at
island
at
napoleon
arkansas
at
walnut
bend
and
at
council
bend
these
shortened
the
river
in
the
aggregate
sixty
seven
miles
in
my
own
time
a
cut
off
was
made
at
american
bend
which
shortened
the
river
ten
miles
or
more
therefore
the
mississippi
between
cairo
and
new
orleans
was
twelve
hundred
and
fifteen
miles
long
one
hundred
and
seventy
six
years
ago
it
was
eleven
hundred
and
eighty
after
the
cut
off
of
it
was
one
thousand
and
forty
after
the
american
bend
cut
off
it
has
lost
sixty
seven
miles
since
consequently
its
length
is
only
nine
hundred
and
seventy
three
miles
at
present
now
if
i
wanted
to
be
one
of
those
ponderous
scientific
people
and
let
on
to
prove
what
had
occurred
in
the
remote
past
by
what
had
occurred
in
a
given
time
in
the
recent
past
or
what
will
occur
in
the
far
future
by
what
has
occurred
in
late
years
what
an
opportunity
is
here
geology
never
had
such
a
chance
nor
such
exact
data
to
argue
from
nor
development
of
species
either
glacial
epochs
are
great
things
but
they
are
vague
vague
please
observe
in
the
space
of
one
hundred
and
seventy
six
years
the
lower
mississippi
has
shortened
itself
two
hundred
and
forty
two
miles
that
is
an
average
of
a
trifle
over
one
mile
and
a
third
per
year
therefore
any
calm
person
who
is
not
blind
or
idiotic
can
see
that
in
the
old
oolitic
silurian
period
just
a
million
years
ago
next
november
the
lower
mississippi
river
was
upwards
of
one
million
three
hundred
thousand
miles
long
and
stuck
out
over
the
gulf
of
mexico
like
a
fishing
rod
and
by
the
same
token
any
person
can
see
that
seven
hundred
and
forty
two
years
from
now
the
lower
mississippi
will
be
only
a
mile
and
three
quarters
long
and
cairo
and
new
orleans
will
have
joined
their
streets
together
and
be
plodding
comfortably
along
under
a
single
mayor
and
a
mutual
board
of
aldermen
there
is
something
fascinating
about
science
one
gets
such
wholesale
returns
of
conjecture
out
of
such
a
trifling
investment
of
fact
when
the
water
begins
to
flow
through
one
of
those
ditches
i
have
been
speaking
of
it
is
time
for
the
people
thereabouts
to
move
the
water
cleaves
the
banks
away
like
a
knife
by
the
time
the
ditch
has
become
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
wide
the
calamity
is
as
good
as
accomplished
for
no
power
on
earth
can
stop
it
now
when
the
width
has
reached
a
hundred
yards
the
banks
begin
to
peel
off
in
slices
half
an
acre
wide
the
current
flowing
around
the
bend
traveled
formerly
only
five
miles
an
hour
now
it
is
tremendously
increased
by
the
shortening
of
the
distance
i
was
on
board
the
first
boat
that
tried
to
go
through
the
cut
off
at
american
bend
but
we
did
not
get
through
it
was
toward
midnight
and
a
wild
night
it
was
thunder
lightning
and
torrents
of
rain
it
was
estimated
that
the
current
in
the
cut
off
was
making
about
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
an
hour
twelve
or
thirteen
was
the
best
our
boat
could
do
even
in
tolerably
slack
water
therefore
perhaps
we
were
foolish
to
try
the
cut
off
however
mr
brown
was
ambitious
and
he
kept
on
trying
the
eddy
running
up
the
bank
under
the
point
was
about
as
swift
as
the
current
out
in
the
middle
so
we
would
go
flying
up
the
shore
like
a
lightning
express
train
get
on
a
big
head
of
steam
and
stand
by
for
a
surge
when
we
struck
the
current
that
was
whirling
by
the
point
but
all
our
preparations
were
useless
the
instant
the
current
hit
us
it
spun
us
around
like
a
top
the
water
deluged
the
forecastle
and
the
boat
careened
so
far
over
that
one
could
hardly
keep
his
feet
the
next
instant
we
were
away
down
the
river
clawing
with
might
and
main
to
keep
out
of
the
woods
we
tried
the
experiment
four
times
i
stood
on
the
forecastle
companion
way
to
see
it
was
astonishing
to
observe
how
suddenly
the
boat
would
spin
around
and
turn
tail
the
moment
she
emerged
from
the
eddy
and
the
current
struck
her
nose
the
sounding
concussion
and
the
quivering
would
have
been
about
the
same
if
she
had
come
full
speed
against
a
sand
bank
under
the
lightning
flashes
one
could
see
the
plantation
cabins
and
the
goodly
acres
tumble
into
the
river
and
the
crash
they
made
was
not
a
bad
effort
at
thunder
once
when
we
spun
around
we
only
missed
a
house
about
twenty
feet
that
had
a
light
burning
in
the
window
and
in
the
same
instant
that
house
went
overboard
nobody
could
stay
on
our
forecastle
the
water
swept
across
it
in
a
torrent
every
time
we
plunged
athwart
the
current
at
the
end
of
our
fourth
effort
we
brought
up
in
the
woods
two
miles
below
the
cut
off
all
the
country
there
was
overflowed
of
course
a
day
or
two
later
the
cut
off
was
three
quarters
of
a
mile
wide
and
boats
passed
up
through
it
without
much
difficulty
and
so
saved
ten
miles
the
old
raccourci
cut
off
reduced
the
river's
length
twenty
eight
miles
there
used
to
be
a
tradition
connected
with
it
it
was
said
that
a
boat
came
along
there
in
the
night
and
went
around
the
enormous
elbow
the
usual
way
the
pilots
not
knowing
that
the
cut
off
had
been
made
it
was
a
grisly
hideous
night
and
all
shapes
were
vague
and
distorted
the
old
bend
had
already
begun
to
fill
up
and
the
boat
got
to
running
away
from
mysterious
reefs
and
occasionally
hitting
one
the
perplexed
pilots
fell
to
swearing
and
finally
uttered
the
entirely
unnecessary
wish
that
they
might
never
get
out
of
that
place
as
always
happens
in
such
cases
that
particular
prayer
was
answered
and
the
others
neglected
so
to
this
day
that
phantom
steamer
is
still
butting
around
in
that
deserted
river
trying
to
find
her
way
out
more
than
one
grave
watchman
has
sworn
to
me
that
on
drizzly
dismal
nights
he
has
glanced
fearfully
down
that
forgotten
river
as
he
passed
the
head
of
the
island
and
seen
the
faint
glow
of
the
specter
steamer's
lights
drifting
through
the
distant
gloom
and
heard
the
muffled
cough
of
her
scape
pipes
and
the
plaintive
cry
of
her
leadsmen
in
the
absence
of
further
statistics
i
beg
to
close
this
chapter
with
one
more
reminiscence
of
stephen
most
of
the
captains
and
pilots
held
stephen's
note
for
borrowed
sums
ranging
from
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
upward
stephen
never
paid
one
of
these
notes
but
he
was
very
prompt
and
very
zealous
about
renewing
them
every
twelve
months
of
course
there
came
a
time
at
last
when
stephen
could
no
longer
borrow
of
his
ancient
creditors
so
he
was
obliged
to
lie
in
wait
for
new
men
who
did
not
know
him
such
a
victim
was
good
hearted
simple
natured
young
yates
i
use
a
fictitious
name
but
the
real
name
began
as
this
one
does
with
a
y
young
yates
graduated
as
a
pilot
got
a
berth
and
when
the
month
was
ended
and
he
stepped
up
to
the
clerk's
office
and
received
his
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
in
crisp
new
bills
stephen
was
there
his
silvery
tongue
began
to
wag
and
in
a
very
little
while
yates's
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
had
changed
hands
the
fact
was
soon
known
at
pilot
headquarters
and
the
amusement
and
satisfaction
of
the
old
creditors
were
large
and
generous
but
innocent
yates
never
suspected
that
stephen's
promise
to
pay
promptly
at
the
end
of
the
week
was
a
worthless
one
yates
called
for
his
money
at
the
stipulated
time
stephen
sweetened
him
up
and
put
him
off
a
week
he
called
then
according
to
agreement
and
came
away
sugar
coated
again
but
suffering
under
another
postponement
so
the
thing
went
on
yates
haunted
stephen
week
after
week
to
no
purpose
and
at
last
gave
it
up
and
then
straightway
stephen
began
to
haunt
yates
wherever
yates
appeared
there
was
the
inevitable
stephen
and
not
only
there
but
beaming
with
affection
and
gushing
with
apologies
for
not
being
able
to
pay
by
and
by
whenever
poor
yates
saw
him
coming
he
would
turn
and
fly
and
drag
his
company
with
him
if
he
had
company
but
it
was
of
no
use
his
debtor
would
run
him
down
and
corner
him
panting
and
red
faced
stephen
would
come
with
outstretched
hands
and
eager
eyes
invade
the
conversation
shake
both
of
yates's
arms
loose
in
their
sockets
and
begin
my
what
a
race
i've
had
i
saw
you
didn't
see
me
and
so
i
clapped
on
all
steam
for
fear
i'd
miss
you
entirely
and
here
you
are
there
just
stand
so
and
let
me
look
at
you
just
the
same
old
noble
countenance
yates's
friend
just
look
at
him
look
at
him
ain't
it
just
good
to
look
at
him
ain't
it
now
ain't
he
just
a
picture
some
call
him
a
picture
i
call
him
a
panorama
that's
what
he
is
an
entire
panorama
and
now
i'm
reminded
how
i
do
wish
i
could
have
seen
you
an
hour
earlier
for
twenty
four
hours
i've
been
saving
up
that
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
for
you
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
i
waited
at
the
planter's
from
six
yesterday
evening
till
two
o'clock
this
morning
without
rest
or
food
my
wife
says
where
have
you
been
all
night
i
said
this
debt
lies
heavy
on
my
mind
she
says
in
all
my
days
i
never
saw
a
man
take
a
debt
to
heart
the
way
you
do
i
said
it's
my
nature
how
can
i
change
it
she
says
well
do
go
to
bed
and
get
some
rest
i
said
not
till
that
poor
noble
young
man
has
got
his
money
so
i
set
up
all
night
and
this
morning
out
i
shot
and
the
first
man
i
struck
told
me
you
had
shipped
on
the
grand
turk
and
gone
to
new
orleans
well
sir
i
had
to
lean
up
against
a
building
and
cry
so
help
me
goodness
i
couldn't
help
it
the
man
that
owned
the
place
come
out
cleaning
up
with
a
rag
and
said
he
didn't
like
to
have
people
cry
against
his
building
and
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
whole
world
had
turned
against
me
and
it
wasn't
any
use
to
live
any
more
and
coming
along
an
hour
ago
suffering
no
man
knows
what
agony
i
met
jim
wilson
and
paid
him
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
on
account
and
to
think
that
here
you
are
now
and
i
haven't
got
a
cent
but
as
sure
as
i
am
standing
here
on
this
ground
on
this
particular
brick
there
i've
scratched
a
mark
on
the
brick
to
remember
it
by
i'll
borrow
that
money
and
pay
it
over
to
you
at
twelve
o'clock
sharp
tomorrow
now
stand
so
let
me
look
at
you
just
once
more
and
so
on
yates's
life
became
a
burden
to
him
he
could
not
escape
his
debtor
and
his
debtor's
awful
sufferings
on
account
of
not
being
able
to
pay
he
dreaded
to
show
himself
in
the
street
lest
he
should
find
stephen
lying
in
wait
for
him
at
the
corner
bogart's
billiard
saloon
was
a
great
resort
for
pilots
in
those
days
they
met
there
about
as
much
to
exchange
river
news
as
to
play
one
morning
yates
was
there
stephen
was
there
too
but
kept
out
of
sight
but
by
and
by
when
about
all
the
pilots
had
arrived
who
were
in
town
stephen
suddenly
appeared
in
the
midst
and
rushed
for
yates
as
for
a
long
lost
brother
oh
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
oh
my
soul
the
sight
of
you
is
such
a
comfort
to
my
eyes
gentlemen
i
owe
all
of
you
money
among
you
i
owe
probably
forty
thousand
dollars
i
want
to
pay
it
i
intend
to
pay
it
every
last
cent
of
it
you
all
know
without
my
telling
you
what
sorrow
it
has
cost
me
to
remain
so
long
under
such
deep
obligations
to
such
patient
and
generous
friends
but
the
sharpest
pang
i
suffer
by
far
the
sharpest
is
from
the
debt
i
owe
to
this
noble
young
man
here
and
i
have
come
to
this
place
this
morning
especially
to
make
the
announcement
that
i
have
at
last
found
a
method
whereby
i
can
pay
off
all
my
debts
and
most
especially
i
wanted
him
to
be
here
when
i
announced
it
yes
my
faithful
friend
my
benefactor
i've
found
the
method
i've
found
the
method
to
pay
off
all
my
debts
and
you'll
get
your
money
hope
dawned
in
yates's
eye
then
stephen
beaming
benignantly
and
placing
his
hand
upon
yates's
head
added
i
am
going
to
pay
them
off
in
alphabetical
order
then
he
turned
and
disappeared
the
full
significance
of
stephen's
method
did
not
dawn
upon
the
perplexed
and
musing
crowd
for
some
two
minutes
and
then
yates
murmured
with
a
sigh
well
the
y's
stand
a
gaudy
chance
he
won't
get
any
further
than
the
c's
in
this
world
and
i
reckon
that
after
a
good
deal
of
eternity
has
wasted
away
in
the
next
one
i'll
still
be
referred
to
up
there
as
that
poor
ragged
pilot
that
came
here
from
st
louis
in
the
early
days
chapter
i
take
a
few
extra
lessons
during
the
two
or
two
and
a
half
years
of
my
apprenticeship
i
served
under
many
pilots
and
had
experience
of
many
kinds
of
steamboatmen
and
many
varieties
of
steamboats
for
it
was
not
always
convenient
for
mr
bixby
to
have
me
with
him
and
in
such
cases
he
sent
me
with
somebody
else
i
am
to
this
day
profiting
somewhat
by
that
experience
for
in
that
brief
sharp
schooling
i
got
personally
and
familiarly
acquainted
with
about
all
the
different
types
of
human
nature
that
are
to
be
found
in
fiction
biography
or
history
the
fact
is
daily
borne
in
upon
me
that
the
average
shore
employment
requires
as
much
as
forty
years
to
equip
a
man
with
this
sort
of
an
education
when
i
say
i
am
still
profiting
by
this
thing
i
do
not
mean
that
it
has
constituted
me
a
judge
of
men
no
it
has
not
done
that
for
judges
of
men
are
born
not
made
my
profit
is
various
in
kind
and
degree
but
the
feature
of
it
which
i
value
most
is
the
zest
which
that
early
experience
has
given
to
my
later
reading
when
i
find
a
well
drawn
character
in
fiction
or
biography
i
generally
take
a
warm
personal
interest
in
him
for
the
reason
that
i
have
known
him
before
met
him
on
the
river
the
figure
that
comes
before
me
oftenest
out
of
the
shadows
of
that
vanished
time
is
that
of
brown
of
the
steamer
pennsylvania
the
man
referred
to
in
a
former
chapter
whose
memory
was
so
good
and
tiresome
he
was
a
middle
aged
long
slim
bony
smooth
shaven
horse
faced
ignorant
stingy
malicious
snarling
fault
hunting
mote
magnifying
tyrant
i
early
got
the
habit
of
coming
on
watch
with
dread
at
my
heart
no
matter
how
good
a
time
i
might
have
been
having
with
the
off
watch
below
and
no
matter
how
high
my
spirits
might
be
when
i
started
aloft
my
soul
became
lead
in
my
body
the
moment
i
approached
the
pilot
house
i
still
remember
the
first
time
i
ever
entered
the
presence
of
that
man
the
boat
had
backed
out
from
st
louis
and
was
straightening
down
i
ascended
to
the
pilot
house
in
high
feather
and
very
proud
to
be
semi
officially
a
member
of
the
executive
family
of
so
fast
and
famous
a
boat
brown
was
at
the
wheel
i
paused
in
the
middle
of
the
room
all
fixed
to
make
my
bow
but
brown
did
not
look
around
i
thought
he
took
a
furtive
glance
at
me
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
but
as
not
even
this
notice
was
repeated
i
judged
i
had
been
mistaken
by
this
time
he
was
picking
his
way
among
some
dangerous
breaks
abreast
the
woodyards
therefore
it
would
not
be
proper
to
interrupt
him
so
i
stepped
softly
to
the
high
bench
and
took
a
seat
there
was
silence
for
ten
minutes
then
my
new
boss
turned
and
inspected
me
deliberately
and
painstakingly
from
head
to
heel
for
about
as
it
seemed
to
me
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
which
he
removed
his
countenance
and
i
saw
it
no
more
for
some
seconds
then
it
came
around
once
more
and
this
question
greeted
me
are
you
horace
bigsby's
cub
yes
sir
after
this
there
was
a
pause
and
another
inspection
then
what's
your
name
i
told
him
he
repeated
it
after
me
it
was
probably
the
only
thing
he
ever
forgot
for
although
i
was
with
him
many
months
he
never
addressed
himself
to
me
in
any
other
way
than
here
and
then
his
command
followed
where
was
you
born
in
florida
missouri
a
pause
then
dern
sight
better
staid
there
by
means
of
a
dozen
or
so
of
pretty
direct
questions
he
pumped
my
family
history
out
of
me
the
leads
were
going
now
in
the
first
crossing
this
interrupted
the
inquest
when
the
leads
had
been
laid
in
he
resumed
how
long
you
been
on
the
river
i
told
him
after
a
pause
where'd
you
get
them
shoes
i
gave
him
the
information
hold
up
your
foot
i
did
so
he
stepped
back
examined
the
shoe
minutely
and
contemptuously
scratching
his
head
thoughtfully
tilting
his
high
sugar
loaf
hat
well
forward
to
facilitate
the
operation
then
ejaculated
well
i'll
be
dod
derned
and
returned
to
his
wheel
what
occasion
there
was
to
be
dod
derned
about
it
is
a
thing
which
is
still
as
much
of
a
mystery
to
me
now
as
it
was
then
it
must
have
been
all
of
fifteen
minutes
fifteen
minutes
of
dull
homesick
silence
before
that
long
horse
face
swung
round
upon
me
again
and
then
what
a
change
it
was
as
red
as
fire
and
every
muscle
in
it
was
working
now
came
this
shriek
here
you
going
to
set
there
all
day
i
lit
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
shot
there
by
the
electric
suddenness
of
the
surprise
as
soon
as
i
could
get
my
voice
i
said
apologetically
i
have
had
no
orders
sir
you've
had
no
orders
my
what
a
fine
bird
we
are
we
must
have
orders
our
father
was
a
gentleman
owned
slaves
and
we've
been
to
school
yes
we
are
a
gentleman
too
and
got
to
have
orders
orders
is
it
orders
is
what
you
want
dod
dern
my
skin
i'll
learn
you
to
swell
yourself
up
and
blow
around
here
about
your
dod
derned
orders
g'way
from
the
wheel
i
had
approached
it
without
knowing
it
i
moved
back
a
step
or
two
and
stood
as
in
a
dream
all
my
senses
stupefied
by
this
frantic
assault
what
you
standing
there
for
take
that
ice
pitcher
down
to
the
texas
tender
come
move
along
and
don't
you
be
all
day
about
it
the
moment
i
got
back
to
the
pilot
house
brown
said
here
what
was
you
doing
down
there
all
this
time
i
couldn't
find
the
texas
tender
i
had
to
go
all
the
way
to
the
pantry
derned
likely
story
fill
up
the
stove
i
proceeded
to
do
so
he
watched
me
like
a
cat
presently
he
shouted
put
down
that
shovel
deadest
numskull
i
ever
saw
ain't
even
got
sense
enough
to
load
up
a
stove
all
through
the
watch
this
sort
of
thing
went
on
yes
and
the
subsequent
watches
were
much
like
it
during
a
stretch
of
months
as
i
have
said
i
soon
got
the
habit
of
coming
on
duty
with
dread
the
moment
i
was
in
the
presence
even
in
the
darkest
night
i
could
feel
those
yellow
eyes
upon
me
and
knew
their
owner
was
watching
for
a
pretext
to
spit
out
some
venom
on
me
preliminarily
he
would
say
here
take
the
wheel
two
minutes
later
where
in
the
nation
you
going
to
pull
her
down
pull
her
down
after
another
moment
say
you
going
to
hold
her
all
day
let
her
go
meet
her
meet
her
then
he
would
jump
from
the
bench
snatch
the
wheel
from
me
and
meet
her
himself
pouring
out
wrath
upon
me
all
the
time
george
ritchie
was
the
other
pilot's
cub
he
was
having
good
times
now
for
his
boss
george
ealer
was
as
kindhearted
as
brown
wasn't
ritchie
had
steeled
for
brown
the
season
before
consequently
he
knew
exactly
how
to
entertain
himself
and
plague
me
all
by
the
one
operation
whenever
i
took
the
wheel
for
a
moment
on
ealer's
watch
ritchie
would
sit
back
on
the
bench
and
play
brown
with
continual
ejaculations
of
snatch
her
snatch
her
derndest
mud
cat
i
ever
saw
here
where
you
going
now
going
to
run
over
that
snag
pull
her
down
don't
you
hear
me
pull
her
down
there
she
goes
just
as
i
expected
i
told
you
not
to
cramp
that
reef
g'way
from
the
wheel
so
i
always
had
a
rough
time
of
it
no
matter
whose
watch
it
was
and
sometimes
it
seemed
to
me
that
ritchie's
good
natured
badgering
was
pretty
nearly
as
aggravating
as
brown's
dead
earnest
nagging
i
often
wanted
to
kill
brown
but
this
would
not
answer
a
cub
had
to
take
everything
his
boss
gave
in
the
way
of
vigorous
comment
and
criticism
and
we
all
believed
that
there
was
a
united
states
law
making
it
a
penitentiary
offense
to
strike
or
threaten
a
pilot
who
was
on
duty
however
i
could
imagine
myself
killing
brown
there
was
no
law
against
that
and
that
was
the
thing
i
used
always
to
do
the
moment
i
was
abed
instead
of
going
over
my
river
in
my
mind
as
was
my
duty
i
threw
business
aside
for
pleasure
and
killed
brown
i
killed
brown
every
night
for
months
not
in
old
stale
commonplace
ways
but
in
new
and
picturesque
ones
ways
that
were
sometimes
surprising
for
freshness
of
design
and
ghastliness
of
situation
and
environment
brown
was
always
watching
for
a
pretext
to
find
fault
and
if
he
could
find
no
plausible
pretext
he
would
invent
one
he
would
scold
you
for
shaving
a
shore
and
for
not
shaving
it
for
hugging
a
bar
and
for
not
hugging
it
for
pulling
down
when
not
invited
and
for
not
pulling
down
when
not
invited
for
firing
up
without
orders
and
for
waiting
for
orders
in
a
word
it
was
his
invariable
rule
to
find
fault
with
everything
you
did
and
another
invariable
rule
of
his
was
to
throw
all
his
remarks
to
you
into
the
form
of
an
insult
one
day
we
were
approaching
new
madrid
bound
down
and
heavily
laden
brown
was
at
one
side
of
the
wheel
steering
i
was
at
the
other
standing
by
to
pull
down
or
shove
up
he
cast
a
furtive
glance
at
me
every
now
and
then
i
had
long
ago
learned
what
that
meant
viz
he
was
trying
to
invent
a
trap
for
me
i
wondered
what
shape
it
was
going
to
take
by
and
by
he
stepped
back
from
the
wheel
and
said
in
his
usual
snarly
way
here
see
if
you've
got
gumption
enough
to
round
her
to
this
was
simply
bound
to
be
a
success
nothing
could
prevent
it
for
he
had
never
allowed
me
to
round
the
boat
to
before
consequently
no
matter
how
i
might
do
the
thing
he
could
find
free
fault
with
it
he
stood
back
there
with
his
greedy
eye
on
me
and
the
result
was
what
might
have
been
foreseen
i
lost
my
head
in
a
quarter
of
a
minute
and
didn't
know
what
i
was
about
i
started
too
early
to
bring
the
boat
around
but
detected
a
green
gleam
of
joy
in
brown's
eye
and
corrected
my
mistake
i
started
around
once
more
while
too
high
up
but
corrected
myself
again
in
time
i
made
other
false
moves
and
still
managed
to
save
myself
but
at
last
i
grew
so
confused
and
anxious
that
i
tumbled
into
the
very
worst
blunder
of
all
i
got
too
far
down
before
beginning
to
fetch
the
boat
around
brown's
chance
was
come
his
face
turned
red
with
passion
he
made
one
bound
hurled
me
across
the
house
with
a
sweep
of
his
arm
spun
the
wheel
down
and
began
to
pour
out
a
stream
of
vituperation
upon
me
which
lasted
till
he
was
out
of
breath
in
the
course
of
this
speech
he
called
me
all
the
different
kinds
of
hard
names
he
could
think
of
and
once
or
twice
i
thought
he
was
even
going
to
swear
but
he
didn't
this
time
dod
dern
was
the
nearest
he
ventured
to
the
luxury
of
swearing
for
he
had
been
brought
up
with
a
wholesome
respect
for
future
fire
and
brimstone
that
was
an
uncomfortable
hour
for
there
was
a
big
audience
on
the
hurricane
deck
when
i
went
to
bed
that
night
i
killed
brown
in
seventeen
different
ways
all
of
them
new
chapter
brown
and
i
exchange
compliments
two
trips
later
i
got
into
serious
trouble
brown
was
steering
i
was
pulling
down
my
younger
brother
appeared
on
the
hurricane
deck
and
shouted
to
brown
to
stop
at
some
landing
or
other
a
mile
or
so
below
brown
gave
no
intimation
that
he
had
heard
anything
but
that
was
his
way
he
never
condescended
to
take
notice
of
an
under
clerk
the
wind
was
blowing
brown
was
deaf
although
he
always
pretended
he
wasn't
and
i
very
much
doubted
if
he
had
heard
the
order
if
i
had
two
heads
i
would
have
spoken
but
as
i
had
only
one
it
seemed
judicious
to
take
care
of
it
so
i
kept
still
presently
sure
enough
we
went
sailing
by
that
plantation
captain
klinefelter
appeared
on
the
deck
and
said
let
her
come
around
sir
let
her
come
around
didn't
henry
tell
you
to
land
here
no
sir
i
sent
him
up
to
do
it
he
did
come
up
and
that's
all
the
good
it
done
the
dod
derned
fool
he
never
said
anything
didn't
you
hear
him
asked
the
captain
of
me
of
course
i
didn't
want
to
be
mixed
up
in
this
business
but
there
was
no
way
to
avoid
it
so
i
said
yes
sir
i
knew
what
brown's
next
remark
would
be
before
he
uttered
it
it
was
shut
your
mouth
you
never
heard
anything
of
the
kind
i
closed
my
mouth
according
to
instructions
an
hour
later
henry
entered
the
pilot
house
unaware
of
what
had
been
going
on
he
was
a
thoroughly
inoffensive
boy
and
i
was
sorry
to
see
him
come
for
i
knew
brown
would
have
no
pity
on
him
brown
began
straightway
here
why
didn't
you
tell
me
we'd
got
to
land
at
that
plantation
i
did
tell
you
mr
brown
it's
a
lie
i
said
you
lie
yourself
he
did
tell
you
brown
glared
at
me
in
unaffected
surprise
and
for
as
much
as
a
moment
he
was
entirely
speechless
then
he
shouted
to
me
i'll
attend
to
your
case
in
half
a
minute
then
to
henry
and
you
leave
the
pilot
house
out
with
you
it
was
pilot
law
and
must
be
obeyed
the
boy
started
out
and
even
had
his
foot
on
the
upper
step
outside
the
door
when
brown
with
a
sudden
access
of
fury
picked
up
a
ten
pound
lump
of
coal
and
sprang
after
him
but
i
was
between
with
a
heavy
stool
and
i
hit
brown
a
good
honest
blow
which
stretched
him
out
i
had
committed
the
crime
of
crimes
i
had
lifted
my
hand
against
a
pilot
on
duty
i
supposed
i
was
booked
for
the
penitentiary
sure
and
couldn't
be
booked
any
surer
if
i
went
on
and
squared
my
long
account
with
this
person
while
i
had
the
chance
consequently
i
stuck
to
him
and
pounded
him
with
my
fists
a
considerable
time
i
do
not
know
how
long
the
pleasure
of
it
probably
made
it
seem
longer
than
it
really
was
but
in
the
end
he
struggled
free
and
jumped
up
and
sprang
to
the
wheel
a
very
natural
solicitude
for
all
this
time
here
was
this
steamboat
tearing
down
the
river
at
the
rate
of
fifteen
miles
an
hour
and
nobody
at
the
helm
however
eagle
bend
was
two
miles
wide
at
this
bank
full
stage
and
correspondingly
long
and
deep
and
the
boat
was
steering
herself
straight
down
the
middle
and
taking
no
chances
still
that
was
only
luck
a
body
might
have
found
her
charging
into
the
woods
perceiving
at
a
glance
that
the
pennsylvania
was
in
no
danger
brown
gathered
up
the
big
spy
glass
war
club
fashion
and
ordered
me
out
of
the
pilot
house
with
more
than
comanche
bluster
but
i
was
not
afraid
of
him
now
so
instead
of
going
i
tarried
and
criticized
his
grammar
i
reformed
his
ferocious
speeches
for
him
and
put
them
into
good
english
calling
his
attention
to
the
advantage
of
pure
english
over
the
bastard
dialect
of
the
pennsylvanian
collieries
whence
he
was
extracted
he
could
have
done
his
part
to
admiration
in
a
cross
fire
of
mere
vituperation
of
course
but
he
was
not
equipped
for
this
species
of
controversy
so
he
presently
laid
aside
his
glass
and
took
the
wheel
muttering
and
shaking
his
head
and
i
retired
to
the
bench
the
racket
had
brought
everybody
to
the
hurricane
deck
and
i
trembled
when
i
saw
the
old
captain
looking
up
from
the
midst
of
the
crowd
i
said
to
myself
now
i
am
done
for
for
although
as
a
rule
he
was
so
fatherly
and
indulgent
toward
the
boat's
family
and
so
patient
of
minor
shortcomings
he
could
be
stern
enough
when
the
fault
was
worth
it
i
tried
to
imagine
what
he
would
do
to
a
cub
pilot
who
had
been
guilty
of
such
a
crime
as
mine
committed
on
a
boat
guard
deep
with
costly
freight
and
alive
with
passengers
our
watch
was
nearly
ended
i
thought
i
would
go
and
hide
somewhere
till
i
got
a
chance
to
slide
ashore
so
i
slipped
out
of
the
pilot
house
and
down
the
steps
and
around
to
the
texas
door
and
was
in
the
act
of
gliding
within
when
the
captain
confronted
me
i
dropped
my
head
and
he
stood
over
me
in
silence
a
moment
or
two
then
said
impressively
follow
me
i
dropped
into
his
wake
he
led
the
way
to
his
parlor
in
the
forward
end
of
the
texas
we
were
alone
now
he
closed
the
after
door
then
moved
slowly
to
the
forward
one
and
closed
that
he
sat
down
i
stood
before
him
he
looked
at
me
some
little
time
then
said
so
you
have
been
fighting
mr
brown
i
answered
meekly
yes
sir
do
you
know
that
that
is
a
very
serious
matter
yes
sir
are
you
aware
that
this
boat
was
plowing
down
the
river
fully
five
minutes
with
no
one
at
the
wheel
yes
sir
did
you
strike
him
first
yes
sir
what
with
a
stool
sir
hard
middling
sir
did
it
knock
him
down
he
he
fell
sir
did
you
follow
it
up
did
you
do
anything
further
yes
sir
what
did
you
do
pounded
him
sir
pounded
him
yes
sir
did
you
pound
him
much
that
is
severely
one
might
call
it
that
sir
maybe
i'm
deuced
glad
of
it
hark
ye
never
mention
that
i
said
that
you
have
been
guilty
of
a
great
crime
and
don't
you
ever
be
guilty
of
it
again
on
this
boat
but
lay
for
him
ashore
give
him
a
good
sound
thrashing
do
you
hear
i'll
pay
the
expenses
now
go
and
mind
you
not
a
word
of
this
to
anybody
clear
out
with
you
you've
been
guilty
of
a
great
crime
you
whelp
i
slid
out
happy
with
the
sense
of
a
close
shave
and
a
mighty
deliverance
and
i
heard
him
laughing
to
himself
and
slapping
his
fat
thighs
after
i
had
closed
his
door
when
brown
came
off
watch
he
went
straight
to
the
captain
who
was
talking
with
some
passengers
on
the
boiler
deck
and
demanded
that
i
be
put
ashore
in
new
orleans
and
added
i'll
never
turn
a
wheel
on
this
boat
again
while
that
cub
stays
the
captain
said
but
he
needn't
come
round
when
you
are
on
watch
mr
brown
i
won't
even
stay
on
the
same
boat
with
him
one
of
us
has
got
to
go
ashore
very
well
said
the
captain
let
it
be
yourself
and
resumed
his
talk
with
the
passengers
during
the
brief
remainder
of
the
trip
i
knew
how
an
emancipated
slave
feels
for
i
was
an
emancipated
slave
myself
while
we
lay
at
landings
i
listened
to
george
ealer's
flute
or
to
his
readings
from
his
two
bibles
that
is
to
say
goldsmith
and
shakespeare
or
i
played
chess
with
him
and
would
have
beaten
him
sometimes
only
he
always
took
back
his
last
move
and
ran
the
game
out
differently
chapter
a
catastrophe
we
lay
three
days
in
new
orleans
but
the
captain
did
not
succeed
in
finding
another
pilot
so
he
proposed
that
i
should
stand
a
daylight
watch
and
leave
the
night
watches
to
george
ealer
but
i
was
afraid
i
had
never
stood
a
watch
of
any
sort
by
myself
and
i
believed
i
should
be
sure
to
get
into
trouble
in
the
head
of
some
chute
or
ground
the
boat
in
a
near
cut
through
some
bar
or
other
brown
remained
in
his
place
but
he
would
not
travel
with
me
so
the
captain
gave
me
an
order
on
the
captain
of
the
a
t
lacey
for
a
passage
to
st
louis
and
said
he
would
find
a
new
pilot
there
and
my
steersman's
berth
could
then
be
resumed
the
lacey
was
to
leave
a
couple
of
days
after
the
pennsylvania
the
night
before
the
pennsylvania
left
henry
and
i
sat
chatting
on
a
freight
pile
on
the
levee
till
midnight
the
subject
of
the
chat
mainly
was
one
which
i
think
we
had
not
exploited
before
steamboat
disasters
one
was
then
on
its
way
to
us
little
as
we
suspected
it
the
water
which
was
to
make
the
steam
which
should
cause
it
was
washing
past
some
point
fifteen
hundred
miles
up
the
river
while
we
talked
but
it
would
arrive
at
the
right
time
and
the
right
place
we
doubted
if
persons
not
clothed
with
authority
were
of
much
use
in
cases
of
disaster
and
attendant
panic
still
they
might
be
of
some
use
so
we
decided
that
if
a
disaster
ever
fell
within
our
experience
we
would
at
least
stick
to
the
boat
and
give
such
minor
service
as
chance
might
throw
in
the
way
henry
remembered
this
afterward
when
the
disaster
came
and
acted
accordingly
the
lacey
started
up
the
river
two
days
behind
the
pennsylvania
we
touched
at
greenville
mississippi
a
couple
of
days
out
and
somebody
shouted
the
pennsylvania
is
blown
up
at
ship
island
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
lives
lost
at
napoleon
arkansas
the
same
evening
we
got
an
extra
issued
by
a
memphis
paper
which
gave
some
particulars
it
mentioned
my
brother
and
said
he
was
not
hurt
further
up
the
river
we
got
a
later
extra
my
brother
was
again
mentioned
but
this
time
as
being
hurt
beyond
help
we
did
not
get
full
details
of
the
catastrophe
until
we
reached
memphis
this
is
the
sorrowful
story
it
was
six
o'clock
on
a
hot
summer
morning
the
pennsylvania
was
creeping
along
north
of
ship
island
about
sixty
miles
below
memphis
on
a
half
head
of
steam
towing
a
wood
flat
which
was
fast
being
emptied
george
ealer
was
in
the
pilot
house
alone
i
think
the
second
engineer
and
a
striker
had
the
watch
in
the
engine
room
the
second
mate
had
the
watch
on
deck
george
black
mr
wood
and
my
brother
clerks
were
asleep
as
were
also
brown
and
the
head
engineer
the
carpenter
the
chief
mate
and
one
striker
captain
klinefelter
was
in
the
barber's
chair
and
the
barber
was
preparing
to
shave
him
there
were
a
good
many
cabin
passengers
aboard
and
three
or
four
hundred
deck
passengers
so
it
was
said
at
the
time
and
not
very
many
of
them
were
astir
the
wood
being
nearly
all
out
of
the
flat
now
ealer
rang
to
come
ahead
full
steam
and
the
next
moment
four
of
the
eight
boilers
exploded
with
a
thunderous
crash
and
the
whole
forward
third
of
the
boat
was
hoisted
toward
the
sky
the
main
part
of
the
mass
with
the
chimneys
dropped
upon
the
boat
again
a
mountain
of
riddled
and
chaotic
rubbish
and
then
after
a
little
fire
broke
out
many
people
were
flung
to
considerable
distances
and
fell
in
the
river
among
these
were
mr
wood
and
my
brother
and
the
carpenter
the
carpenter
was
still
stretched
upon
his
mattress
when
he
struck
the
water
seventy
five
feet
from
the
boat
brown
the
pilot
and
george
black
chief
clerk
were
never
seen
or
heard
of
after
the
explosion
the
barber's
chair
with
captain
klinefelter
in
it
and
unhurt
was
left
with
its
back
overhanging
vacancy
everything
forward
of
it
floor
and
all
had
disappeared
and
the
stupefied
barber
who
was
also
unhurt
stood
with
one
toe
projecting
over
space
still
stirring
his
lather
unconsciously
and
saying
not
a
word
when
george
ealer
saw
the
chimneys
plunging
aloft
in
front
of
him
he
knew
what
the
matter
was
so
he
muffled
his
face
in
the
lapels
of
his
coat
and
pressed
both
hands
there
tightly
to
keep
this
protection
in
its
place
so
that
no
steam
could
get
to
his
nose
or
mouth
he
had
ample
time
to
attend
to
these
details
while
he
was
going
up
and
returning
he
presently
landed
on
top
of
the
unexploded
boilers
forty
feet
below
the
former
pilot
house
accompanied
by
his
wheel
and
a
rain
of
other
stuff
and
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
scalding
steam
all
of
the
many
who
breathed
that
steam
died
none
escaped
but
ealer
breathed
none
of
it
he
made
his
way
to
the
free
air
as
quickly
as
he
could
and
when
the
steam
cleared
away
he
returned
and
climbed
up
on
the
boilers
again
and
patiently
hunted
out
each
and
every
one
of
his
chessmen
and
the
several
joints
of
his
flute
by
this
time
the
fire
was
beginning
to
threaten
shrieks
and
groans
filled
the
air
a
great
many
persons
had
been
scalded
a
great
many
crippled
the
explosion
had
driven
an
iron
crowbar
through
one
man's
body
i
think
they
said
he
was
a
priest
he
did
not
die
at
once
and
his
sufferings
were
very
dreadful
a
young
french
naval
cadet
of
fifteen
son
of
a
french
admiral
was
fearfully
scalded
but
bore
his
tortures
manfully
both
mates
were
badly
scalded
but
they
stood
to
their
posts
nevertheless
they
drew
the
wood
boat
aft
and
they
and
the
captain
fought
back
the
frantic
herd
of
frightened
immigrants
till
the
wounded
could
be
brought
there
and
placed
in
safety
first
when
mr
wood
and
henry
fell
in
the
water
they
struck
out
for
shore
which
was
only
a
few
hundred
yards
away
but
henry
presently
said
he
believed
he
was
not
hurt
what
an
unaccountable
error
and
therefore
would
swim
back
to
the
boat
and
help
save
the
wounded
so
they
parted
and
henry
returned
by
this
time
the
fire
was
making
fierce
headway
and
several
persons
who
were
imprisoned
under
the
ruins
were
begging
piteously
for
help
all
efforts
to
conquer
the
fire
proved
fruitless
so
the
buckets
were
presently
thrown
aside
and
the
officers
fell
to
with
axes
and
tried
to
cut
the
prisoners
out
a
striker
was
one
of
the
captives
he
said
he
was
not
injured
but
could
not
free
himself
and
when
he
saw
that
the
fire
was
likely
to
drive
away
the
workers
he
begged
that
some
one
would
shoot
him
and
thus
save
him
from
the
more
dreadful
death
the
fire
did
drive
the
axmen
away
and
they
had
to
listen
helpless
to
this
poor
fellow's
supplications
till
the
flames
ended
his
miseries
the
fire
drove
all
into
the
wood
flat
that
could
be
accommodated
there
it
was
cut
adrift
then
and
it
and
the
burning
steamer
floated
down
the
river
toward
ship
island
they
moored
the
flat
at
the
head
of
the
island
and
there
unsheltered
from
the
blazing
sun
the
half
naked
occupants
had
to
remain
without
food
or
stimulants
or
help
for
their
hurts
during
the
rest
of
the
day
a
steamer
came
along
finally
and
carried
the
unfortunates
to
memphis
and
there
the
most
lavish
assistance
was
at
once
forthcoming
by
this
time
henry
was
insensible
the
physicians
examined
his
injuries
and
saw
that
they
were
fatal
and
naturally
turned
their
main
attention
to
patients
who
could
be
saved
forty
of
the
wounded
were
placed
upon
pallets
on
the
floor
of
a
great
public
hall
and
among
these
was
henry
there
the
ladies
of
memphis
came
every
day
with
flowers
fruits
and
dainties
and
delicacies
of
all
kinds
and
there
they
remained
and
nursed
the
wounded
all
the
physicians
stood
watches
there
and
all
the
medical
students
and
the
rest
of
the
town
furnished
money
or
whatever
else
was
wanted
and
memphis
knew
how
to
do
all
these
things
well
for
many
a
disaster
like
the
pennsylvania's
had
happened
near
her
doors
and
she
was
experienced
above
all
other
cities
on
the
river
in
the
gracious
office
of
the
good
samaritan
the
sight
i
saw
when
i
entered
that
large
hall
was
new
and
strange
to
me
two
long
rows
of
prostrate
forms
more
than
forty
in
all
and
every
face
and
head
a
shapeless
wad
of
loose
raw
cotton
it
was
a
gruesome
spectacle
i
watched
there
six
days
and
nights
and
a
very
melancholy
experience
it
was
there
was
one
daily
incident
which
was
peculiarly
depressing
this
was
the
removal
of
the
doomed
to
a
chamber
apart
it
was
done
in
order
that
the
morale
of
the
other
patients
might
not
be
injuriously
affected
by
seeing
one
of
their
number
in
the
death
agony
the
fated
one
was
always
carried
out
with
as
little
stir
as
possible
and
the
stretcher
was
always
hidden
from
sight
by
a
wall
of
assistants
but
no
matter
everybody
knew
what
that
cluster
of
bent
forms
with
its
muffled
step
and
its
slow
movement
meant
and
all
eyes
watched
it
wistfully
and
a
shudder
went
abreast
of
it
like
a
wave
i
saw
many
poor
fellows
removed
to
the
death
room
and
saw
them
no
more
afterward
but
i
saw
our
chief
mate
carried
thither
more
than
once
his
hurts
were
frightful
especially
his
scalds
he
was
clothed
in
linseed
oil
and
raw
cotton
to
his
waist
and
resembled
nothing
human
he
was
often
out
of
his
mind
and
then
his
pains
would
make
him
rave
and
shout
and
sometimes
shriek
then
after
a
period
of
dumb
exhaustion
his
disordered
imagination
would
suddenly
transform
the
great
apartment
into
a
forecastle
and
the
hurrying
throng
of
nurses
into
the
crew
and
he
would
come
to
a
sitting
posture
and
shout
hump
yourselves
hump
yourselves
you
petrifactions
snail
bellies
pall
bearers
going
to
be
all
day
getting
that
hatful
of
freight
out
and
supplement
this
explosion
with
a
firmament
obliterating
irruption
or
profanity
which
nothing
could
stay
or
stop
till
his
crater
was
empty
and
now
and
then
while
these
frenzies
possessed
him
he
would
tear
off
handfuls
of
the
cotton
and
expose
his
cooked
flesh
to
view
it
was
horrible
it
was
bad
for
the
others
of
course
this
noise
and
these
exhibitions
so
the
doctors
tried
to
give
him
morphine
to
quiet
him
but
in
his
mind
or
out
of
it
he
would
not
take
it
he
said
his
wife
had
been
killed
by
that
treacherous
drug
and
he
would
die
before
he
would
take
it
he
suspected
that
the
doctors
were
concealing
it
in
his
ordinary
medicines
and
in
his
water
so
he
ceased
from
putting
either
to
his
lips
once
when
he
had
been
without
water
during
two
sweltering
days
he
took
the
dipper
in
his
hand
and
the
sight
of
the
limpid
fluid
and
the
misery
of
his
thirst
tempted
him
almost
beyond
his
strength
but
he
mastered
himself
and
threw
it
away
and
after
that
he
allowed
no
more
to
be
brought
near
him
three
times
i
saw
him
carried
to
the
death
room
insensible
and
supposed
to
be
dying
but
each
time
he
revived
cursed
his
attendants
and
demanded
to
be
taken
back
he
lived
to
be
mate
of
a
steamboat
again
but
he
was
the
only
one
who
went
to
the
death
room
and
returned
alive
dr
peyton
a
principal
physician
and
rich
in
all
the
attributes
that
go
to
constitute
high
and
flawless
character
did
all
that
educated
judgment
and
trained
skill
could
do
for
henry
but
as
the
newspapers
had
said
in
the
beginning
his
hurts
were
past
help
on
the
evening
of
the
sixth
day
his
wandering
mind
busied
itself
with
matters
far
away
and
his
nerveless
fingers
picked
at
his
coverlet
his
hour
had
struck
we
bore
him
to
the
death
room
poor
boy
chapter
a
section
in
my
biography
in
due
course
i
got
my
license
i
was
a
pilot
now
full
fledged
i
dropped
into
casual
employments
no
misfortunes
resulting
intermittent
work
gave
place
to
steady
and
protracted
engagements
time
drifted
smoothly
and
prosperously
on
and
i
supposed
and
hoped
that
i
was
going
to
follow
the
river
the
rest
of
my
days
and
die
at
the
wheel
when
my
mission
was
ended
but
by
and
by
the
war
came
commerce
was
suspended
my
occupation
was
gone
i
had
to
seek
another
livelihood
so
i
became
a
silver
miner
in
nevada
next
a
newspaper
reporter
next
a
gold
miner
in
california
next
a
reporter
in
san
francisco
next
a
special
correspondent
in
the
sandwich
islands
next
a
roving
correspondent
in
europe
and
the
east
next
an
instructional
torch
bearer
on
the
lecture
platform
and
finally
i
became
a
scribbler
of
books
and
an
immovable
fixture
among
the
other
rocks
of
new
england
in
so
few
words
have
i
disposed
of
the
twenty
one
slow
drifting
years
that
have
come
and
gone
since
i
last
looked
from
the
windows
of
a
pilot
house
let
us
resume
now
chapter
i
return
to
my
muttons
after
twenty
one
years
absence
i
felt
a
very
strong
desire
to
see
the
river
again
and
the
steamboats
and
such
of
the
boys
as
might
be
left
so
i
resolved
to
go
out
there
i
enlisted
a
poet
for
company
and
a
stenographer
to
take
him
down
and
started
westward
about
the
middle
of
april
as
i
proposed
to
make
notes
with
a
view
to
printing
i
took
some
thought
as
to
methods
of
procedure
i
reflected
that
if
i
were
recognized
on
the
river
i
should
not
be
as
free
to
go
and
come
talk
inquire
and
spy
around
as
i
should
be
if
unknown
i
remembered
that
it
was
the
custom
of
steamboatmen
in
the
old
times
to
load
up
the
confiding
stranger
with
the
most
picturesque
and
admirable
lies
and
put
the
sophisticated
friend
off
with
dull
and
ineffectual
facts
so
i
concluded
that
from
a
business
point
of
view
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
disguise
our
party
with
fictitious
names
the
idea
was
certainly
good
but
it
bred
infinite
bother
for
although
smith
jones
and
johnson
are
easy
names
to
remember
when
there
is
no
occasion
to
remember
them
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
recollect
them
when
they
are
wanted
how
do
criminals
manage
to
keep
a
brand
new
alias
in
mind
this
is
a
great
mystery
i
was
innocent
and
yet
was
seldom
able
to
lay
my
hand
on
my
new
name
when
it
was
needed
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
if
i
had
had
a
crime
on
my
conscience
to
further
confuse
me
i
could
never
have
kept
the
name
by
me
at
all
we
left
per
pennsylvania
railroad
at
a
m
april
evening
speaking
of
dress
grace
and
picturesqueness
drop
gradually
out
of
it
as
one
travels
away
from
new
york
i
find
that
among
my
notes
it
makes
no
difference
which
direction
you
take
the
fact
remains
the
same
whether
you
move
north
south
east
or
west
no
matter
you
can
get
up
in
the
morning
and
guess
how
far
you
have
come
by
noting
what
degree
of
grace
and
picturesqueness
is
by
that
time
lacking
in
the
costumes
of
the
new
passengers
i
do
not
mean
of
the
women
alone
but
of
both
sexes
it
may
be
that
carriage
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
thing
and
i
think
it
is
for
there
are
plenty
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
the
provincial
cities
whose
garments
are
all
made
by
the
best
tailors
and
dressmakers
of
new
york
yet
this
has
no
perceptible
effect
upon
the
grand
fact
the
educated
eye
never
mistakes
those
people
for
new
yorkers
no
there
is
a
godless
grace
and
snap
and
style
about
a
born
and
bred
new
yorker
which
mere
clothing
cannot
effect
april
this
morning
struck
into
the
region
of
full
goatees
sometimes
accompanied
by
a
mustache
but
only
occasionally
it
was
odd
to
come
upon
this
thick
crop
of
an
obsolete
and
uncomely
fashion
it
was
like
running
suddenly
across
a
forgotten
acquaintance
whom
you
had
supposed
dead
for
a
generation
the
goatee
extends
over
a
wide
extent
of
country
and
is
accompanied
by
an
iron
clad
belief
in
adam
and
the
biblical
history
of
creation
which
has
not
suffered
from
the
assaults
of
the
scientists
afternoon
at
the
railway
stations
the
loafers
carry
both
hands
in
their
breeches
pockets
it
was
observable
heretofore
that
one
hand
was
sometimes
out
of
doors
here
never
this
is
an
important
fact
in
geography
if
the
loafers
determined
the
character
of
a
country
it
would
be
still
more
important
of
course
heretofore
all
along
the
station
loafer
has
been
often
observed
to
scratch
one
shin
with
the
other
foot
here
these
remains
of
activity
are
wanting
this
has
an
ominous
look
by
and
by
we
entered
the
tobacco
chewing
region
fifty
years
ago
the
tobacco
chewing
region
covered
the
union
it
is
greatly
restricted
now
next
boots
began
to
appear
not
in
strong
force
however
later
away
down
the
mississippi
they
became
the
rule
they
disappeared
from
other
sections
of
the
union
with
the
mud
no
doubt
they
will
disappear
from
the
river
villages
also
when
proper
pavements
come
in
we
reached
st
louis
at
ten
o'clock
at
night
at
the
counter
of
the
hotel
i
tendered
a
hurriedly
invented
fictitious
name
with
a
miserable
attempt
at
careless
ease
the
clerk
paused
and
inspected
me
in
the
compassionate
way
in
which
one
inspects
a
respectable
person
who
is
found
in
doubtful
circumstances
then
he
said
it's
all
right
i
know
what
sort
of
a
room
you
want
used
to
clerk
at
the
st
james
in
new
york
an
unpromising
beginning
for
a
fraudulent
career
we
started
to
the
supper
room
and
met
two
other
men
whom
i
had
known
elsewhere
how
odd
and
unfair
it
is
wicked
impostors
go
around
lecturing
under
my
nom
de
guerre
and
nobody
suspects
them
but
when
an
honest
man
attempts
an
imposture
he
is
exposed
at
once
one
thing
seemed
plain
we
must
start
down
the
river
the
next
day
if
people
who
could
not
be
deceived
were
going
to
crop
up
at
this
rate
an
unpalatable
disappointment
for
we
had
hoped
to
have
a
week
in
st
louis
the
southern
was
a
good
hotel
and
we
could
have
had
a
comfortable
time
there
it
is
large
and
well
conducted
and
its
decorations
do
not
make
one
cry
as
do
those
of
the
vast
palmer
house
in
chicago
true
the
billiard
tables
were
of
the
old
silurian
period
and
the
cues
and
balls
of
the
post
pliocene
but
there
was
refreshment
in
this
not
discomfort
for
there
is
rest
and
healing
in
the
contemplation
of
antiquities
the
most
notable
absence
observable
in
the
billiard
room
was
the
absence
of
the
river
man
if
he
was
there
he
had
taken
in
his
sign
he
was
in
disguise
i
saw
there
none
of
the
swell
airs
and
graces
and
ostentatious
displays
of
money
and
pompous
squanderings
of
it
which
used
to
distinguish
the
steamboat
crowd
from
the
dry
land
crowd
in
the
bygone
days
in
the
thronged
billiard
rooms
of
st
louis
in
those
times
the
principal
saloons
were
always
populous
with
river
men
given
fifty
players
present
thirty
or
thirty
five
were
likely
to
be
from
the
river
but
i
suspected
that
the
ranks
were
thin
now
and
the
steamboatmen
no
longer
an
aristocracy
why
in
my
time
they
used
to
call
the
barkeep
bill
or
joe
or
tom
and
slap
him
on
the
shoulder
i
watched
for
that
but
none
of
these
people
did
it
manifestly
a
glory
that
once
was
had
dissolved
and
vanished
away
in
these
twenty
one
years
when
i
went
up
to
my
room
i
found
there
the
young
man
called
rogers
crying
rogers
was
not
his
name
neither
was
jones
brown
dexter
ferguson
bascom
nor
thompson
but
he
answered
to
either
of
these
that
a
body
found
handy
in
an
emergency
or
to
any
other
name
in
fact
if
he
perceived
that
you
meant
him
he
said
what
is
a
person
to
do
here
when
he
wants
a
drink
of
water
drink
this
slush
can't
you
drink
it
i
could
if
i
had
some
other
water
to
wash
it
with
here
was
a
thing
which
had
not
changed
a
score
of
years
had
not
affected
this
water's
mulatto
complexion
in
the
least
a
score
of
centuries
would
succeed
no
better
perhaps
it
comes
out
of
the
turbulent
bank
caving
missouri
and
every
tumblerful
of
it
holds
nearly
an
acre
of
land
in
solution
i
got
this
fact
from
the
bishop
of
the
diocese
if
you
will
let
your
glass
stand
half
an
hour
you
can
separate
the
land
from
the
water
as
easy
as
genesis
and
then
you
will
find
them
both
good
the
one
good
to
eat
the
other
good
to
drink
the
land
is
very
nourishing
the
water
is
thoroughly
wholesome
the
one
appeases
hunger
the
other
thirst
but
the
natives
do
not
take
them
separately
but
together
as
nature
mixed
them
when
they
find
an
inch
of
mud
in
the
bottom
of
a
glass
they
stir
it
up
and
then
take
the
draught
as
they
would
gruel
it
is
difficult
for
a
stranger
to
get
used
to
this
batter
but
once
used
to
it
he
will
prefer
it
to
water
this
is
really
the
case
it
is
good
for
steamboating
and
good
to
drink
but
it
is
worthless
for
all
other
purposes
except
baptizing
next
morning
we
drove
around
town
in
the
rain
the
city
seemed
but
little
changed
it
was
greatly
changed
but
it
did
not
seem
so
because
in
st
louis
as
in
london
and
pittsburgh
you
can't
persuade
a
new
thing
to
look
new
the
coal
smoke
turns
it
into
an
antiquity
the
moment
you
take
your
hand
off
it
the
place
had
just
about
doubled
its
size
since
i
was
a
resident
of
it
and
was
now
become
a
city
of
inhabitants
still
in
the
solid
business
parts
it
looked
about
as
it
had
looked
formerly
yet
i
am
sure
there
is
not
as
much
smoke
in
st
louis
now
as
there
used
to
be
the
smoke
used
to
bank
itself
in
a
dense
billowy
black
canopy
over
the
town
and
hide
the
sky
from
view
this
shelter
is
very
much
thinner
now
still
there
is
a
sufficiency
of
smoke
there
i
think
i
heard
no
complaint
however
on
the
outskirts
changes
were
apparent
enough
notably
in
dwelling
house
architecture
the
fine
new
homes
are
noble
and
beautiful
and
modern
they
stand
by
themselves
too
with
green
lawns
around
them
whereas
the
dwellings
of
a
former
day
are
packed
together
in
blocks
and
are
all
of
one
pattern
with
windows
all
alike
set
in
an
arched
frame
work
of
twisted
stone
a
sort
of
house
which
was
handsome
enough
when
it
was
rarer
there
was
another
change
the
forest
park
this
was
new
to
me
it
is
beautiful
and
very
extensive
and
has
the
excellent
merit
of
having
been
made
mainly
by
nature
there
are
other
parks
and
fine
ones
notably
tower
grove
and
the
botanical
gardens
for
st
louis
interested
herself
in
such
improvements
at
an
earlier
day
than
did
the
most
of
our
cities
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
st
louis
i
could
have
bought
it
for
six
million
dollars
and
it
was
the
mistake
of
my
life
that
i
did
not
do
it
it
was
bitter
now
to
look
abroad
over
this
domed
and
steepled
metropolis
this
solid
expanse
of
bricks
and
mortar
stretching
away
on
every
hand
into
dim
measure
defying
distances
and
remember
that
i
had
allowed
that
opportunity
to
go
by
why
i
should
have
allowed
it
to
go
by
seems
of
course
foolish
and
inexplicable
to
day
at
a
first
glance
yet
there
were
reasons
at
the
time
to
justify
this
course
a
scotchman
hon
charles
augustus
murray
writing
some
forty
five
or
fifty
years
ago
said
the
streets
are
narrow
ill
paved
and
ill
lighted
those
streets
are
narrow
still
of
course
many
of
them
are
ill
paved
yet
but
the
reproach
of
ill
lighting
cannot
be
repeated
now
the
catholic
new
church
was
the
only
notable
building
then
and
mr
murray
was
confidently
called
upon
to
admire
it
with
its
species
of
grecian
portico
surmounted
by
a
kind
of
steeple
much
too
diminutive
in
its
proportions
and
surmounted
by
sundry
ornaments
which
the
unimaginative
scotchman
found
himself
quite
unable
to
describe
and
therefore
was
grateful
when
a
german
tourist
helped
him
out
with
the
exclamation
by
they
look
exactly
like
bed
posts
st
louis
is
well
equipped
with
stately
and
noble
public
buildings
now
and
the
little
church
which
the
people
used
to
be
so
proud
of
lost
its
importance
a
long
time
ago
still
this
would
not
surprise
mr
murray
if
he
could
come
back
for
he
prophesied
the
coming
greatness
of
st
louis
with
strong
confidence
the
further
we
drove
in
our
inspection
tour
the
more
sensibly
i
realized
how
the
city
had
grown
since
i
had
seen
it
last
changes
in
detail
became
steadily
more
apparent
and
frequent
than
at
first
too
changes
uniformly
evidencing
progress
energy
prosperity
but
the
change
of
changes
was
on
the
levee
this
time
a
departure
from
the
rule
half
a
dozen
sound
asleep
steamboats
where
i
used
to
see
a
solid
mile
of
wide
awake
ones
this
was
melancholy
this
was
woeful
the
absence
of
the
pervading
and
jocund
steamboatman
from
the
billiard
saloon
was
explained
he
was
absent
because
he
is
no
more
his
occupation
is
gone
his
power
has
passed
away
he
is
absorbed
into
the
common
herd
he
grinds
at
the
mill
a
shorn
samson
and
inconspicuous
half
a
dozen
lifeless
steamboats
a
mile
of
empty
wharves
a

the

lying
in

or
three
tiers
here
was
desolation
indeed
the

as
one
in

comes

with
foamy
lips
and
knocking
at
the

for
his
long
lost
multitude
of

the
towboat
and
the
railroad
had
done
their
work
and
done
it
well
and
completely
the
mighty
bridge
stretching
along
over
our
heads
had
done
its
share
in
the
slaughter
and
spoliation
remains
of
former
steamboatmen
told
me
with
wan
satisfaction
that
the
bridge
doesn't
pay
still
it
can
be
no
sufficient
compensation
to
a
corpse
to
know
that
the
dynamite
that
laid
him
out
was
not
of
as
good
quality
as
it
had
been
supposed
to
be
the
pavements
along
the
river
front
were
bad
the
sidewalks
were
rather
out
of
repair
there
was
a
rich
abundance
of
mud
all
this
was
familiar
and
satisfying
but
the
ancient
armies
of
drays
and
struggling
throngs
of
men
and
mountains
of
freight
were
gone
and
sabbath
reigned
in
their
stead
the
immemorial
mile
of
cheap
foul
doggeries
remained
but
business
was
dull
with
them
the
multitudes
of
poison
swilling
irishmen
had
departed
and

st

mississippi
steamboating
was
born
about
at
the
end
of
thirty
years
it
had
grown
to
mighty
proportions
and
in
less
than
thirty
more
it
was
dead
a
strangely
short
life
for
so
majestic
a

of

it
is
not
absolutely
dead
neither
is
a

two

but
as
contrasted
with
what
it
was
in
its
prime
vigor
mississippi
steamboating
may
be
called
dead
it
killed
the
old
fashioned
keel
boating
by
reducing
the
freight
trip
to
new
orleans
to
less
than
a
week
the
railroads
have
killed
the
steamboat
passenger
traffic
by
doing
in
two
or
three
days
what
the
steamboats
consumed
a
week
in
doing
and
the
towing
fleets
have
killed
the
through
freight
traffic
by
dragging
six
or
seven
steamer
loads
of
stuff
down
the
river
at
a
time
at
an
expense
so
trivial
that
steamboat
competition
was
out
of

traffic
remains
to

this
is
in
the
hands
along
the
two
thousand
miles
of
river
between
st
paul
and
new
orleans
of
two
or
three
close
corporations
well
fortified
with
capital
and
by
able
and
thoroughly
business
like
management
and
system
these
make
a
sufficiency
of
money
out
of
what
is
left
of
the
once
prodigious
steamboating
industry
i
suppose
that
st
louis
and
new
orleans
have
not
suffered
materially
by
the
change
but
alas
for
the
wood
yard
man
he
used
to
fringe
the
river
all
the
way
his
close
ranked
merchandise
stretched
from
the
one
city
to
the
other
along
the
banks
and
he
sold
uncountable
cords
of
it
every
year
for
cash
on
the
nail
but
all
the
scattering
boats
that
are
left
burn
coal
now
and
the
seldomest
spectacle
on

is
a

chapter
traveling
incognito
my
idea
was
to
tarry
a
while
in
every
town
between
st
louis
and
new
orleans
to
do
this
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
from
place
to
place
by
the
short
packet
lines
it
was
an
easy
plan
to
make
and
would
have
been
an
easy
one
to
follow
twenty
years
ago
but
not
now
there
are
wide
intervals
between
boats
these
days
i
wanted
to
begin
with
the
interesting
old
french
settlements
of
st
genevieve
and
kaskaskia
sixty
miles
below
st
louis
there
was
only
one
boat
advertised
for
that
section
a
grand
tower
packet
still
one
boat
was
enough
so
we
went
down
to
look
at
her
she
was
a
venerable
rack
heap
and
a
fraud
to
boot
for
she
was
playing
herself
for
personal
property
whereas
the
good
honest
dirt
was
so
thickly
caked
all
over
her
that
she
was
righteously
taxable
as
real
estate
there
are
places
in
new
england
where
her
hurricane
deck
would
be
worth
a
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
an
acre
the
soil
on
her
forecastle
was
quite
good
the
new
crop
of
wheat
was
already
springing
from
the
cracks
in
protected
places
the
companionway
was
of
a
dry
sandy
character
and
would
have
been
well
suited
for
grapes
with
a
southern
exposure
and
a
little
subsoiling
the
soil
of
the
boiler
deck
was
thin
and
rocky
but
good
enough
for
grazing
purposes
a
colored
boy
was
on
watch
here
nobody
else
visible
we
gathered
from
him
that
this
calm
craft
would
go
as
advertised
if
she
got
her
trip
if
she
didn't
get
it
she
would
wait
for
it
has
she
got
any
of
her
trip
bless
you
no
boss
she
ain't
unloadened
yit
she
only
come
in
dis
mawnin
he
was
uncertain
as
to
when
she
might
get
her
trip
but
thought
it
might
be
to
morrow
or
maybe
next
day
this
would
not
answer
at
all
so
we
had
to
give
up
the
novelty
of
sailing
down
the
river
on
a
farm
we
had
one
more
arrow
in
our
quiver
a
vicksburg
packet
the
gold
dust
was
to
leave
at
p
m
we
took
passage
in
her
for
memphis
and
gave
up
the
idea
of
stopping
off
here
and
there
as
being
impracticable
she
was
neat
clean
and
comfortable
we
camped
on
the
boiler
deck
and
bought
some
cheap
literature
to
kill
time
with
the
vender
was
a
venerable
irishman
with
a
benevolent
face
and
a
tongue
that
worked
easily
in
the
socket
and
from
him
we
learned
that
he
had
lived
in
st
louis
thirty
four
years
and
had
never
been
across
the
river
during
that
period
then
he
wandered
into
a
very
flowing
lecture
filled
with
classic
names
and
allusions
which
was
quite
wonderful
for
fluency
until
the
fact
became
rather
apparent
that
this
was
not
the
first
time
nor
perhaps
the
fiftieth
that
the
speech
had
been
delivered
he
was
a
good
deal
of
a
character
and
much
better
company
than
the
sappy
literature
he
was
selling
a
random
remark
connecting
irishmen
and
beer
brought
this
nugget
of
information
out
of
him
they
don't
drink
it
sir
they
can't
drink
it
sir
give
an
irishman
lager
for
a
month
and
he's
a
dead
man
an
irishman
is
lined
with
copper
and
the
beer
corrodes
it
but
whiskey
polishes
the
copper
and
is
the
saving
of
him
sir
at
eight
o'clock
promptly
we
backed
out
and
crossed
the
river
as
we
crept
toward
the
shore
in
the
thick
darkness
a
blinding
glory
of
white
electric
light
burst
suddenly
from
our
forecastle
and
lit
up
the
water
and
the
warehouses
as
with
a
noon
day
glare
another
big
change
this
no
more
flickering
smoky
pitch
dripping
ineffectual
torch
baskets
now
their
day
is
past
next
instead
of
calling
out
a
score
of
hands
to
man
the
stage
a
couple
of
men
and
a
hatful
of
steam
lowered
it
from
the
derrick
where
it
was
suspended
launched
it
deposited
it
in
just
the
right
spot
and
the
whole
thing
was
over
and
done
with
before
a
mate
in
the
olden
time
could
have
got
his
profanity
mill
adjusted
to
begin
the
preparatory
services
why
this
new
and
simple
method
of
handling
the
stages
was
not
thought
of
when
the
first
steamboat
was
built
is
a
mystery
which
helps
one
to
realize
what
a
dull
witted
slug
the
average
human
being
is
we
finally
got
away
at
two
in
the
morning
and
when
i
turned
out
at
six
we
were
rounding
to
at
a
rocky
point
where
there
was
an
old
stone
warehouse
at
any
rate
the
ruins
of
it
two
or
three
decayed
dwelling
houses
were
near
by
in
the
shelter
of
the
leafy
hills
but
there
were
no
evidences
of
human
or
other
animal
life
to
be
seen
i
wondered
if
i
had
forgotten
the
river
for
i
had
no
recollection
whatever
of
this
place
the
shape
of
the
river
too
was
unfamiliar
there
was
nothing
in
sight
anywhere
that
i
could
remember
ever
having
seen
before
i
was
surprised
disappointed
and
annoyed
we
put
ashore
a
well
dressed
lady
and
gentleman
and
two
well
dressed
lady
like
young
girls
together
with
sundry
russia
leather
bags
a
strange
place
for
such
folk
no
carriage
was
waiting
the
party
moved
off
as
if
they
had
not
expected
any
and
struck
down
a
winding
country
road
afoot
but
the
mystery
was
explained
when
we
got
under
way
again
for
these
people
were
evidently
bound
for
a
large
town
which
lay
shut
in
behind
a
tow
head
i
e
new
island
a
couple
of
miles
below
this
landing
i
couldn't
remember
that
town
i
couldn't
place
it
couldn't
call
its
name
so
i
lost
part
of
my
temper
i
suspected
that
it
might
be
st
genevieve
and
so
it
proved
to
be
observe
what
this
eccentric
river
had
been
about
it
had
built
up
this
huge
useless
tow
head
directly
in
front
of
this
town
cut
off
its
river
communications
fenced
it
away
completely
and
made
a
country
town
of
it
it
is
a
fine
old
place
too
and
deserved
a
better
fate
it
was
settled
by
the
french
and
is
a
relic
of
a
time
when
one
could
travel
from
the
mouths
of
the
mississippi
to
quebec
and
be
on
french
territory
and
under
french
rule
all
the
way
presently
i
ascended
to
the
hurricane
deck
and
cast
a
longing
glance
toward
the
pilot
house
chapter
my
incognito
is
exploded
after
a
close
study
of
the
face
of
the
pilot
on
watch
i
was
satisfied
that
i
had
never
seen
him
before
so
i
went
up
there
the
pilot
inspected
me
i
re
inspected
the
pilot
these
customary
preliminaries
over
i
sat
down
on
the
high
bench
and
he
faced
about
and
went
on
with
his
work
every
detail
of
the
pilot
house
was
familiar
to
me
with
one
exception
a
large
mouthed
tube
under
the
breast
board
i
puzzled
over
that
thing
a
considerable
time
then
gave
up
and
asked
what
it
was
for
to
hear
the
engine
bells
through
it
was
another
good
contrivance
which
ought
to
have
been
invented
half
a
century
sooner
so
i
was
thinking
when
the
pilot
asked
do
you
know
what
this
rope
is
for
i
managed
to
get
around
this
question
without
committing
myself
is
this
the
first
time
you
were
ever
in
a
pilot
house
i
crept
under
that
one
where
are
you
from
new
england
first
time
you
have
ever
been
west
i
climbed
over
this
one
if
you
take
an
interest
in
such
things
i
can
tell
you
what
all
these
things
are
for
i
said
i
should
like
it
this
putting
his
hand
on
a
backing
bell
rope
is
to
sound
the
fire
alarm
this
putting
his
hand
on
a
go
ahead
bell
is
to
call
the
texas
tender
this
one
indicating
the
whistle
lever
is
to
call
the
captain
and
so
he
went
on
touching
one
object
after
another
and
reeling
off
his
tranquil
spool
of
lies
i
had
never
felt
so
like
a
passenger
before
i
thanked
him
with
emotion
for
each
new
fact
and
wrote
it
down
in
my
note
book
the
pilot
warmed
to
his
opportunity
and
proceeded
to
load
me
up
in
the
good
old
fashioned
way
at
times
i
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
rupture
his
invention
but
it
always
stood
the
strain
and
he
pulled
through
all
right
he
drifted
by
easy
stages
into
revealments
of
the
river's
marvelous
eccentricities
of
one
sort
and
another
and
backed
them
up
with
some
pretty
gigantic
illustrations
for
instance
do
you
see
that
little
boulder
sticking
out
of
the
water
yonder
well
when
i
first
came
on
the
river
that
was
a
solid
ridge
of
rock
over
sixty
feet
high
and
two
miles
long
all
washed
away
but
that
with
a
sigh
i
had
a
mighty
impulse
to
destroy
him
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
killing
in
any
ordinary
way
would
be
too
good
for
him
once
when
an
odd
looking
craft
with
a
vast
coal
scuttle
slanting
aloft
on
the
end
of
a
beam
was
steaming
by
in
the
distance
he
indifferently
drew
attention
to
it
as
one
might
to
an
object
grown
wearisome
through
familiarity
and
observed
that
it
was
an
alligator
boat
an
alligator
boat
what's
it
for
to
dredge
out
alligators
with
are
they
so
thick
as
to
be
troublesome
well
not
now
because
the
government
keeps
them
down
but
they
used
to
be
not
everywhere
but
in
favorite
places
here
and
there
where
the
river
is
wide
and
shoal
like
plum
point
and
stack
island
and
so
on
places
they
call
alligator
beds
did
they
actually
impede
navigation
years
ago
yes
in
very
low
water
there
was
hardly
a
trip
then
that
we
didn't
get
aground
on
alligators
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
should
certainly
have
to
get
out
my
tomahawk
however
i
restrained
myself
and
said
it
must
have
been
dreadful
yes
it
was
one
of
the
main
difficulties
about
piloting
it
was
so
hard
to
tell
anything
about
the
water
the
damned
things
shift
around
so
never
lie
still
five
minutes
at
a
time
you
can
tell
a
wind
reef
straight
off
by
the
look
of
it
you
can
tell
a
break
you
can
tell
a
sand
reef
that's
all
easy
but
an
alligator
reef
doesn't
show
up
worth
anything
nine
times
in
ten
you
can't
tell
where
the
water
is
and
when
you
do
see
where
it
is
like
as
not
it
ain't
there
when
you
get
there
the
devils
have
swapped
around
so
meantime
of
course
there
were
some
few
pilots
that
could
judge
of
alligator
water
nearly
as
well
as
they
could
of
any
other
kind
but
they
had
to
have
natural
talent
for
it
it
wasn't
a
thing
a
body
could
learn
you
had
to
be
born
with
it
let
me
see
there
was
ben
thornburg
and
beck
jolly
and
squire
bell
and
horace
bixby
and
major
downing
and
john
stevenson
and
billy
gordon
and
jim
brady
and
george
ealer
and
billy
youngblood
all
a
alligator
pilots
they
could
tell
alligator
water
as
far
as
another
christian
could
tell
whiskey
read
it
ah
couldn't
they
though
i
only
wish
i
had
as
many
dollars
as
they
could
read
alligator
water
a
mile
and
a
half
off
yes
and
it
paid
them
to
do
it
too
a
good
alligator
pilot
could
always
get
fifteen
hundred
dollars
a
month
nights
other
people
had
to
lay
up
for
alligators
but
those
fellows
never
laid
up
for
alligators
they
never
laid
up
for
anything
but
fog
they
could
smell
the
best
alligator
water
it
was
said
i
don't
know
whether
it
was
so
or
not
and
i
think
a
body's
got
his
hands
full
enough
if
he
sticks
to
just
what
he
knows
himself
without
going
around
backing
up
other
people's
say
so's
though
there's
a
plenty
that
ain't
backward
about
doing
it
as
long
as
they
can
roust
out
something
wonderful
to
tell
which
is
not
the
style
of
robert
styles
by
as
much
as
three
fathom
maybe
quarter
less
was
this
rob
styles
this
mustached
and
stately
figure
a
slim
enough
cub
in
my
time
how
he
has
improved
in
comeliness
in
five
and
twenty
year
and
in
the
noble
art
of
inflating
his
facts
after
these
musings
i
said
aloud
i
should
think
that
dredging
out
the
alligators
wouldn't
have
done
much
good
because
they
could
come
back
again
right
away
if
you
had
had
as
much
experience
of
alligators
as
i
have
you
wouldn't
talk
like
that
you
dredge
an
alligator
once
and
he's
convinced
it's
the
last
you
hear
of
him
he
wouldn't
come
back
for
pie
if
there's
one
thing
that
an
alligator
is
more
down
on
than
another
it's
being
dredged
besides
they
were
not
simply
shoved
out
of
the
way
the
most
of
the
scoopful
were
scooped
aboard
they
emptied
them
into
the
hold
and
when
they
had
got
a
trip
they
took
them
to
orleans
to
the
government
works
what
for
why
to
make
soldier
shoes
out
of
their
hides
all
the
government
shoes
are
made
of
alligator
hide
it
makes
the
best
shoes
in
the
world
they
last
five
years
and
they
won't
absorb
water
the
alligator
fishery
is
a
government
monopoly
all
the
alligators
are
government
property
just
like
the
live
oaks
you
cut
down
a
live
oak
and
government
fines
you
fifty
dollars
you
kill
an
alligator
and
up
you
go
for
misprision
of
treason
lucky
duck
if
they
don't
hang
you
too
and
they
will
if
you're
a
democrat
the
buzzard
is
the
sacred
bird
of
the
south
and
you
can't
touch
him
the
alligator
is
the
sacred
bird
of
the
government
and
you've
got
to
let
him
alone
do
you
ever
get
aground
on
the
alligators
now
oh
no
it
hasn't
happened
for
years
well
then
why
do
they
still
keep
the
alligator
boats
in
service
just
for
police
duty
nothing
more
they
merely
go
up
and
down
now
and
then
the
present
generation
of
alligators
know
them
as
easy
as
a
burglar
knows
a
roundsman
when
they
see
one
coming
they
break
camp
and
go
for
the
woods
after
rounding
out
and
finishing
up
and
polishing
off
the
alligator
business
he
dropped
easily
and
comfortably
into
the
historical
vein
and
told
of
some
tremendous
feats
of
half
a
dozen
old
time
steamboats
of
his
acquaintance
dwelling
at
special
length
upon
a
certain
extraordinary
performance
of
his
chief
favorite
among
this
distinguished
fleet
and
then
adding
that
boat
was
the
cyclone
last
trip
she
ever
made
she
sunk
that
very
trip
captain
was
tom
ballou
the
most
immortal
liar
that
ever
i
struck
he
couldn't
ever
seem
to
tell
the
truth
in
any
kind
of
weather
why
he
would
make
you
fairly
shudder
he
was
the
most
scandalous
liar
i
left
him
finally
i
couldn't
stand
it
the
proverb
says
like
master
like
man
and
if
you
stay
with
that
kind
of
a
man
you'll
come
under
suspicion
by
and
by
just
as
sure
as
you
live
he
paid
first
class
wages
but
said
i
what's
wages
when
your
reputation's
in
danger
so
i
let
the
wages
go
and
froze
to
my
reputation
and
i've
never
regretted
it
reputation's
worth
everything
ain't
it
that's
the
way
i
look
at
it
he
had
more
selfish
organs
than
any
seven
men
in
the
world
all
packed
in
the
stern
sheets
of
his
skull
of
course
where
they
belonged
they
weighed
down
the
back
of
his
head
so
that
it
made
his
nose
tilt
up
in
the
air
people
thought
it
was
vanity
but
it
wasn't
it
was
malice
if
you
only
saw
his
foot
you'd
take
him
to
be
nineteen
feet
high
but
he
wasn't
it
was
because
his
foot
was
out
of
drawing
he
was
intended
to
be
nineteen
feet
high
no
doubt
if
his
foot
was
made
first
but
he
didn't
get
there
he
was
only
five
feet
ten
that's
what
he
was
and
that's
what
he
is
you
take
the
lies
out
of
him
and
he'll
shrink
to
the
size
of
your
hat
you
take
the
malice
out
of
him
and
he'll
disappear
that
cyclone
was
a
rattler
to
go
and
the
sweetest
thing
to
steer
that
ever
walked
the
waters
set
her
amidships
in
a
big
river
and
just
let
her
go
it
was
all
you
had
to
do
she
would
hold
herself
on
a
star
all
night
if
you
let
her
alone
you
couldn't
ever
feel
her
rudder
it
wasn't
any
more
labor
to
steer
her
than
it
is
to
count
the
republican
vote
in
a
south
carolina
election
one
morning
just
at
daybreak
the
last
trip
she
ever
made
they
took
her
rudder
aboard
to
mend
it
i
didn't
know
anything
about
it
i
backed
her
out
from
the
wood
yard
and
went
a
weaving
down
the
river
all
serene
when
i
had
gone
about
twenty
three
miles
and
made
four
horribly
crooked
crossings
without
any
rudder
yes
old
capt
tom
appeared
on
the
roof
and
began
to
find
fault
with
me
for
running
such
a
dark
night
such
a
dark
night
why
you
said
never
mind
what
i
said
twas
as
dark
as
egypt
now
though
pretty
soon
the
moon
began
to
rise
and
you
mean
the
sun
because
you
started
out
just
at
break
of
look
here
was
this
before
you
quitted
the
captain
on
account
of
his
lying
or
it
was
before
oh
a
long
time
before
and
as
i
was
saying
he
but
was
this
the
trip
she
sunk
or
was
oh
no
months
afterward
and
so
the
old
man
he
then
she
made
two
last
trips
because
you
said
he
stepped
back
from
the
wheel
swabbing
away
his
perspiration
and
said
here
calling
me
by
name
you
take
her
and
lie
a
while
you're
handier
at
it
than
i
am
trying
to
play
yourself
for
a
stranger
and
an
innocent
why
i
knew
you
before
you
had
spoken
seven
words
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
find
out
what
was
your
little
game
it
was
to
draw
me
out
well
i
let
you
didn't
i
now
take
the
wheel
and
finish
the
watch
and
next
time
play
fair
and
you
won't
have
to
work
your
passage
thus
ended
the
fictitious
name
business
and
not
six
hours
out
from
st
louis
but
i
had
gained
a
privilege
any
way
for
i
had
been
itching
to
get
my
hands
on
the
wheel
from
the
beginning
i
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
river
but
i
hadn't
forgotten
how
to
steer
a
steamboat
nor
how
to
enjoy
it
either
chapter
from
cairo
to
hickman
the
scenery
from
st
louis
to
cairo
two
hundred
miles
is
varied
and
beautiful
the
hills
were
clothed
in
the
fresh
foliage
of
spring
now
and
were
a
gracious
and
worthy
setting
for
the
broad
river
flowing
between
our
trip
began
auspiciously
with
a
perfect
day
as
to
breeze
and
sunshine
and
our
boat
threw
the
miles
out
behind
her
with
satisfactory
despatch
we
found
a
railway
intruding
at
chester
illinois
chester
has
also
a
penitentiary
now
and
is
otherwise
marching
on
at
grand
tower
too
there
was
a
railway
and
another
at
cape
girardeau
the
former
town
gets
its
name
from
a
huge
squat
pillar
of
rock
which
stands
up
out
of
the
water
on
the
missouri
side
of
the
river
a
piece
of
nature's
fanciful
handiwork
and
is
one
of
the
most
picturesque
features
of
the
scenery
of
that
region
for
nearer
or
remoter
neighbors
the
tower
has
the
devil's
bake
oven
so
called
perhaps
because
it
does
not
powerfully
resemble
anybody
else's
bake
oven
and
the
devil's
tea
table
this
latter
a
great
smooth
surfaced
mass
of
rock
with
diminishing
wine
glass
stem
perched
some
fifty
or
sixty
feet
above
the
river
beside
a
beflowered
and
garlanded
precipice
and
sufficiently
like
a
tea
table
to
answer
for
anybody
devil
or
christian
away
down
the
river
we
have
the
devil's
elbow
and
the
devil's
race
course
and
lots
of
other
property
of
his
which
i
cannot
now
call
to
mind
the
town
of
grand
tower
was
evidently
a
busier
place
than
it
had
been
in
old
times
but
it
seemed
to
need
some
repairs
here
and
there
and
a
new
coat
of
whitewash
all
over
still
it
was
pleasant
to
me
to
see
the
old
coat
once
more
uncle
mumford
our
second
officer
said
the
place
had
been
suffering
from
high
water
and
consequently
was
not
looking
its
best
now
but
he
said
it
was
not
strange
that
it
didn't
waste
white
wash
on
itself
for
more
lime
was
made
there
and
of
a
better
quality
than
anywhere
in
the
west
and
added
on
a
dairy
farm
you
never
can
get
any
milk
for
your
coffee
nor
any
sugar
for
it
on
a
sugar
plantation
and
it
is
against
sense
to
go
to
a
lime
town
to
hunt
for
white
wash
in
my
own
experience
i
knew
the
first
two
items
to
be
true
and
also
that
people
who
sell
candy
don't
care
for
candy
therefore
there
was
plausibility
in
uncle
mumford's
final
observation
that
people
who
make
lime
run
more
to
religion
than
whitewash
uncle
mumford
said
further
that
grand
tower
was
a
great
coaling
center
and
a
prospering
place
cape
girardeau
is
situated
on
a
hillside
and
makes
a
handsome
appearance
there
is
a
great
jesuit
school
for
boys
at
the
foot
of
the
town
by
the
river
uncle
mumford
said
it
had
as
high
a
reputation
for
thoroughness
as
any
similar
institution
in
missouri
there
was
another
college
higher
up
on
an
airy
summit
a
bright
new
edifice
picturesquely
and
peculiarly
towered
and
pinnacled
a
sort
of
gigantic
casters
with
the
cruets
all
complete
uncle
mumford
said
that
cape
girardeau
was
the
athens
of
missouri
and
contained
several
colleges
besides
those
already
mentioned
and
all
of
them
on
a
religious
basis
of
one
kind
or
another
he
directed
my
attention
to
what
he
called
the
strong
and
pervasive
religious
look
of
the
town
but
i
could
not
see
that
it
looked
more
religious
than
the
other
hill
towns
with
the
same
slope
and
built
of
the
same
kind
of
bricks
partialities
often
make
people
see
more
than
really
exists
uncle
mumford
has
been
thirty
years
a
mate
on
the
river
he
is
a
man
of
practical
sense
and
a
level
head
has
observed
has
had
much
experience
of
one
sort
and
another
has
opinions
has
also
just
a
perceptible
dash
of
poetry
in
his
composition
an
easy
gift
of
speech
a
thick
growl
in
his
voice
and
an
oath
or
two
where
he
can
get
at
them
when
the
exigencies
of
his
office
require
a
spiritual
lift
he
is
a
mate
of
the
blessed
old
time
kind
and
goes
gravely
damning
around
when
there
is
work
to
the
fore
in
a
way
to
mellow
the
ex
steamboatman's
heart
with
sweet
soft
longings
for
the
vanished
days
that
shall
come
no
more
git
up
there
you
going
to
be
all
day
why
d'n't
you
say
you
was
petrified
in
your
hind
legs
before
you
shipped
he
is
a
steady
man
with
his
crew
kind
and
just
but
firm
so
they
like
him
and
stay
with
him
he
is
still
in
the
slouchy
garb
of
the
old
generation
of
mates
but
next
trip
the
anchor
line
will
have
him
in
uniform
a
natty
blue
naval
uniform
with
brass
buttons
along
with
all
the
officers
of
the
line
and
then
he
will
be
a
totally
different
style
of
scenery
from
what
he
is
now
uniforms
on
the
mississippi
it
beats
all
the
other
changes
put
together
for
surprise
still
there
is
another
surprise
that
it
was
not
made
fifty
years
ago
it
is
so
manifestly
sensible
that
it
might
have
been
thought
of
earlier
one
would
suppose
during
fifty
years
out
there
the
innocent
passenger
in
need
of
help
and
information
has
been
mistaking
the
mate
for
the
cook
and
the
captain
for
the
barber
and
being
roughly
entertained
for
it
too
but
his
troubles
are
ended
now
and
the
greatly
improved
aspect
of
the
boat's
staff
is
another
advantage
achieved
by
the
dress
reform
period

to
take

through
in
low
water
thebes
at
the
head
of
the
grand
chain
and
commerce
at
the
foot
of
it
were
towns
easily
rememberable
as
they
had
not
undergone
conspicuous
alteration
nor
the
chain
either
in
the
nature
of
things
for
it
is
a
chain
of
sunken
rocks
admirably
arranged
to

and

nights

my
first
friend
the
paul
jones
she
knocked
her
bottom
out
and
went
down
like
a
pot
so
the
historian
told
me
uncle
mumford
he
said
she
had
a
gray
mare
aboard
and
a
preacher
to
me
this
sufficiently
accounted
for
the
disaster
as
it
did
of
course
to
mumford
who
added
but
there
are
many
ignorant
people
who
would
scoff
at
such
a
matter
and
call
it
superstition
but
you
will
always
notice
that
they
are
people
who
have
never
traveled
with
a
gray
mare
and
a
preacher
i
went
down
the
river
once
in
such
company
we
grounded
at
bloody
island
we
grounded
at
hanging
dog
we
grounded
just
below
this
same
commerce
we
jolted
beaver
dam
rock
we
hit
one
of
the
worst
breaks
in
the
graveyard
behind
goose
island
we
had
a
roustabout
killed
in
a
fight
we
burnt
a
boiler
broke
a
shaft
collapsed
a
flue
and
went
into
cairo
with
nine
feet
of
water
in
the
hold
may
have
been
more
may
have
been
less
i
remember
it
as
if
it
were
yesterday
the
men
lost
their
heads
with
terror
they
painted
the
mare
blue
in
sight
of
town
and
threw
the
preacher
overboard
or
we
should
not
have
arrived
at
all
the
preacher
was
fished
out
and
saved
he
acknowledged
himself
that
he
had
been
to
blame
i
remember
it
all
as
if
it
were
yesterday
that
this
combination
of
preacher
and
gray
mare
should
breed
calamity
seems
strange
and
at
first
glance
unbelievable
but
the
fact
is
fortified
by
so
much
unassailable
proof
that
to
doubt
is
to
dishonor
reason
i
myself
remember
a
case
where
a
captain
was
warned
by
numerous
friends
against
taking
a
gray
mare
and
a
preacher
with
him
but
persisted
in
his
purpose
in
spite
of
all
that
could
be
said
and
the
same
day
it
may
have
been
the
next
and
some
say
it
was
though
i
think
it
was
the
same
day
he
got
drunk
and
fell
down
the
hatchway
and
was
borne
to
his
home
a
corpse
this
is
literally
true

every
shred
of

do
not
even
remember

part
of
the

it
used
to
be
in

that
it
was
between
st

somewhere
it
was
a
bad
region
all
around
and
about

island
in
early
days
a
farmer
who
lived
on
the
illinois
shore
there
said
that
twenty
nine

strung

prodigious
break
it
used
to
be
close

the
shore
and
boats
went
down
outside
of
it
a
big
island
that
used
to
be
away
out
in

has
retired

is
all
gone

a
little
dab
the
size
of
a
steamboat
the
perilous
graveyard
among
whose
numberless
wrecks
we
used
to
pick
our
way
so
slowly
and
gingerly
is
far
away
from
the
channel
now
and
a
terror
to
nobody
one
of
the
islands
formerly
called
the
two

gone
entirely
the
other
which
used
to
lie
close
to
the
illinois
shore
is
now
on
the
missouri
side
a
mile
away
it
is
joined
solidly
to
the
shore
and
it
takes
a
sharp
eye
to
see
where
the
seam
is
but
it
is
illinois
ground
yet
and
the
people
who
live
on
it
have
to
ferry
themselves
over
and
work
the
illinois
roads
and
pay
illinois
taxes
singular

cairo
was
still
there
easily
visible
across
the
long

we
had
to
steam
a

around

we
were

down
hard
feelings
going
into
cairo
we
came
near
killing
a
steamboat
which
paid
no
attention
to
our
whistle
and
then
tried
to
cross
our
bows
by
doing
some
strong
backing
we
saved
him
which
was
a
great
loss
for
he
would
have
made
good
literature
cairo
is
a
brisk
town
now
and
is
substantially
built
and
has
a
city
look
about
it
which
is
in
noticeable
contrast
to
its
former
estate
as
per
mr
dickens's
portrait
of
it
however
it
was
already
building
with
bricks
when
i
had
seen
it
last
which
was
when
colonel
now
general
grant
was
drilling
his
first
command
there
uncle
mumford
says
the
libraries
and
sunday
schools
have
done
a
good
work
in
cairo
as
well
as
the
brick
masons
cairo
has
a
heavy
railroad
and
river
trade
and
her
situation
at
the
junction
of
the
two
great
rivers
is
so
advantageous
that
she
cannot
well
help
prospering
when
i
turned
out
in
the
morning
we
had
passed
columbus
kentucky
and
were
approaching
hickman
a
pretty
town
perched
on
a
handsome
hill
hickman
is
in
a
rich
tobacco
region
and
formerly
enjoyed
a
great
and
lucrative
trade
in
that
staple
collecting
it
there
in
her
warehouses
from
a
large
area
of
country
and
shipping
it
by
boat
but
uncle
mumford
says
she
built
a
railway
to
facilitate
this
commerce
a
little
more
and
he
thinks
it
facilitated
it
the
wrong
way
took
the
bulk
of
the
trade
out
of
her
hands
by
collaring
it
along
the
line
without
gathering
it
at
her
doors
chapter
under
fire
talk
began
to
run
upon
the
war
now
for
we
were
getting
down
into
the
upper
edge
of
the
former
battle
stretch
by
this
time
columbus
was
just
behind
us
so
there
was
a
good
deal
said
about
the
famous
battle
of
belmont
several
of
the
boat's
officers
had
seen
active
service
in
the
mississippi
war
fleet
i
gathered
that
they
found
themselves
sadly
out
of
their
element
in
that
kind
of
business
at
first
but
afterward
got
accustomed
to
it
reconciled
to
it
and
more
or
less
at
home
in
it
one
of
our
pilots
had
his
first
war
experience
in
the
belmont
fight
as
a
pilot
on
a
boat
in
the
confederate
service
i
had
often
had
a
curiosity
to
know
how
a
green
hand
might
feel
in
his
maiden
battle
perched
all
solitary
and
alone
on
high
in
a
pilot
house
a
target
for
tom
dick
and
harry
and
nobody
at
his
elbow
to
shame
him
from
showing
the
white
feather
when
matters
grew
hot
and
perilous
around
him
so
to
me
his
story
was
valuable
it
filled
a
gap
for
me
which
all
histories
had
left
till
that
time
empty
the
pilot's
first
battle
he
said
it
was
the
of
november
the
fight
began
at
seven
in
the
morning
i
was
on
the
r
h
w
hill
took
over
a
load
of
troops
from
columbus
came
back
and
took
over
a
battery
of
artillery
my
partner
said
he
was
going
to
see
the
fight
wanted
me
to
go
along
i
said
no
i
wasn't
anxious
i
would
look
at
it
from
the
pilot
house
he
said
i
was
a
coward
and
left
that
fight
was
an
awful
sight
general
cheatham
made
his
men
strip
their
coats
off
and
throw
them
in
a
pile
and
said
now
follow
me
to
hell
or
victory
i
heard
him
say
that
from
the
pilot
house
and
then
he
galloped
in
at
the
head
of
his
troops
old
general
pillow
with
his
white
hair
mounted
on
a
white
horse
sailed
in
too
leading
his
troops
as
lively
as
a
boy
by
and
by
the
federals
chased
the
rebels
back
and
here
they
came
tearing
along
everybody
for
himself
and
devil
take
the
hindmost
and
down
under
the
bank
they
scrambled
and
took
shelter
i
was
sitting
with
my
legs
hanging
out
of
the
pilot
house
window
all
at
once
i
noticed
a
whizzing
sound
passing
my
ear
judged
it
was
a
bullet
i
didn't
stop
to
think
about
anything
i
just
tilted
over
backwards
and
landed
on
the
floor
and
staid
there
the
balls
came
booming
around
three
cannon
balls
went
through
the
chimney
one
ball
took
off
the
corner
of
the
pilot
house
shells
were
screaming
and
bursting
all
around
mighty
warm
times
i
wished
i
hadn't
come
i
lay
there
on
the
pilot
house
floor
while
the
shots
came
faster
and
faster
i
crept
in
behind
the
big
stove
in
the
middle
of
the
pilot
house
presently
a
minie
ball
came
through
the
stove
and
just
grazed
my
head
and
cut
my
hat
i
judged
it
was
time
to
go
away
from
there
the
captain
was
on
the
roof
with
a
red
headed
major
from
memphis
a
fine
looking
man
i
heard
him
say
he
wanted
to
leave
here
but
that
pilot
is
killed
i
crept
over
to
the
starboard
side
to
pull
the
bell
to
set
her
back
raised
up
and
took
a
look
and
i
saw
about
fifteen
shot
holes
through
the
window
panes
had
come
so
lively
i
hadn't
noticed
them
i
glanced
out
on
the
water
and
the
spattering
shot
were
like
a
hailstorm
i
thought
best
to
get
out
of
that
place
i
went
down
the
pilot
house
guy
head
first
not
feet
first
but
head
first
slid
down
before
i
struck
the
deck
the
captain
said
we
must
leave
there
so
i
climbed
up
the
guy
and
got
on
the
floor
again
about
that
time
they
collared
my
partner
and
were
bringing
him
up
to
the
pilot
house
between
two
soldiers
somebody
had
said
i
was
killed
he
put
his
head
in
and
saw
me
on
the
floor
reaching
for
the
backing
bells
he
said
oh
hell
he
ain't
shot
and
jerked
away
from
the
men
who
had
him
by
the
collar
and
ran
below
we
were
there
until
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
and
then
got
away
all
right
the
next
time
i
saw
my
partner
i
said
now
come
out
be
honest
and
tell
me
the
truth
where
did
you
go
when
you
went
to
see
that
battle
he
says
i
went
down
in
the
hold
all
through
that
fight
i
was
scared
nearly
to
death
i
hardly
knew
anything
i
was
so
frightened
but
you
see
nobody
knew
that
but
me
next
day
general
polk
sent
for
me
and
praised
me
for
my
bravery
and
gallant
conduct
i
never
said
anything
i
let
it
go
at
that
i
judged
it
wasn't
so
but
it
was
not
for
me
to
contradict
a
general
officer
pretty
soon
after
that
i
was
sick
and
used
up
and
had
to
go
off
to
the
hot
springs
when
there
i
got
a
good
many
letters
from
commanders
saying
they
wanted
me
to
come
back
i
declined
because
i
wasn't
well
enough
or
strong
enough
but
i
kept
still
and
kept
the
reputation
i
had
made
a
plain
story
straightforwardly
told
but
mumford
told
me
that
that
pilot
had
gilded
that
scare
of
his
in
spots
that
his
subsequent
career
in
the
war
was
proof
of
it
we
struck
down
through
the
chute
of
island
no
and
i
went
below
and
fell
into
conversation
with
a
passenger
a
handsome
man
with
easy
carriage
and
an
intelligent
face
we
were
approaching
island
no
a
place
so
celebrated
during
the
war
this
gentleman's
home
was
on
the
main
shore
in
its
neighborhood
i
had
some
talk
with
him
about
the
war
times
but
presently
the
discourse
fell
upon
feuds
for
in
no
part
of
the
south
has
the
vendetta
flourished
more
briskly
or
held
out
longer
between
warring
families
than
in
this
particular
region
this
gentleman
said
there's
been
more
than
one
feud
around
here
in
old
times
but
i
reckon
the
worst
one
was
between
the
darnells
and
the
watsons
nobody
don't
know
now
what
the
first
quarrel
was
about
it's
so
long
ago
the
darnells
and
the
watsons
don't
know
if
there's
any
of
them
living
which
i
don't
think
there
is
some
says
it
was
about
a
horse
or
a
cow
anyway
it
was
a
little
matter
the
money
in
it
wasn't
of
no
consequence
none
in
the
world
both
families
was
rich
the
thing
could
have
been
fixed
up
easy
enough
but
no
that
wouldn't
do
rough
words
had
been
passed
and
so
nothing
but
blood
could
fix
it
up
after
that
that
horse
or
cow
whichever
it
was
cost
sixty
years
of
killing
and
crippling
every
year
or
so
somebody
was
shot
on
one
side
or
the
other
and
as
fast
as
one
generation
was
laid
out
their
sons
took
up
the
feud
and
kept
it
a
going
and
it's
just
as
i
say
they
went
on
shooting
each
other
year
in
and
year
out
making
a
kind
of
a
religion
of
it
you
see
till
they'd
done
forgot
long
ago
what
it
was
all
about
wherever
a
darnell
caught
a
watson
or
a
watson
caught
a
darnell
one
of
em
was
going
to
get
hurt
only
question
was
which
of
them
got
the
drop
on
the
other
they'd
shoot
one
another
down
right
in
the
presence
of
the
family
they
didn't
hunt
for
each
other
but
when
they
happened
to
meet
they
puffed
and
begun
men
would
shoot
boys
boys
would
shoot
men
a
man
shot
a
boy
twelve
years
old
happened
on
him

both
families
belonged
to
the
same
church
everybody
around
here
is
religious
through
all
this
fifty
or
sixty
years
fuss
both
tribes
was
there
every
sunday
to
worship
they
lived
each
side
of
the
line
and
the
church
was
at
a
landing
called
compromise
half
the
church
and
half
the
aisle
was
in
kentucky
the
other
half
in
tennessee
sundays
you'd
see
the
families
drive
up
all
in
their
sunday
clothes
men
women
and
children
and
file
up
the
aisle
and
set
down
quiet
and
orderly
one
lot
on
the
tennessee
side
of
the
church
and
the
other
on
the
kentucky
side
and
the
men
and
boys
would
lean
their
guns
up
against
the
wall
handy
and
then
all
hands
would
join
in
with
the
prayer
and
praise
though
they
say
the
man
next
the
aisle
didn't
kneel
down
along
with
the
rest
of
the
family
kind
of
stood
guard
i
don't
know
never
was
at
that
church
in
my
life
but
i
remember
that
that's
what
used
to
be
said
twenty
or
twenty
five
years
ago
one
of
the
feud
families
caught
a
young
man
of
nineteen
out
and
killed
him
don't
remember
whether
it
was
the
darnells
and
watsons
or
one
of
the
other
feuds
but
anyway
this
young
man
rode
up
steamboat
laying
there
at
the
time
and
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
a
whole
gang
of
the
enemy
he
jumped
down
behind
a
wood
pile
but
they
rode
around
and
begun
on
him
he
firing
back
and
they
galloping
and
cavorting
and
yelling
and
banging
away
with
all
their
might
think
he
wounded
a
couple
of
them
but
they
closed
in
on
him
and
chased
him
into
the
river
and
as
he
swum
along
down
stream
they
followed
along
the
bank
and
kept
on
shooting
at
him
and
when
he
struck
shore
he
was
dead
windy
marshall
told
me
about
it
he
saw
it
he
was
captain
of
the
boat
years
ago
the
darnells
was
so
thinned
out
that
the
old
man
and
his
two
sons
concluded
they'd
leave
the
country
they
started
to
take
steamboat
just
above
no
but
the
watsons
got
wind
of
it
and
they
arrived
just
as
the
two
young
darnells
was
walking
up
the
companion
way
with
their
wives
on
their
arms
the
fight
begun
then
and
they
never
got
no
further
both
of
them
killed
after
that
old
darnell
got
into
trouble
with
the
man
that
run
the
ferry
and
the
ferry
man
got
the
worst
of
it
and
died
but
his
friends
shot
old
darnell
through
and
through
filled
him
full
of
bullets
and
ended
him
the
country
gentleman
who
told
me
these
things
had
been
reared
in
ease
and
comfort
was
a
man
of
good
parts
and
was
college
bred
his
loose
grammar
was
the
fruit
of
careless
habit
not
ignorance
this
habit
among
educated
men
in
the
west
is
not
universal
but
it
is
prevalent
prevalent
in
the
towns
certainly
if
not
in
the
cities
and
to
a
degree
which
one
cannot
help
noticing
and
marveling
at
i
heard
a
westerner
who
would
be
accounted
a
highly
educated
man
in
any
country
say
never
mind
it
don't
make
no
difference
anyway
a
life
long
resident
who
was
present
heard
it
but
it
made
no
impression
upon
her
she
was
able
to
recall
the
fact
afterward
when
reminded
of
it
but
she
confessed
that
the
words
had
not
grated
upon
her
ear
at
the
time
a
confession
which
suggests
that
if
educated
people
can
hear
such
blasphemous
grammar
from
such
a
source
and
be
unconscious
of
the
deed
the
crime
must
be
tolerably
common
so
common
that
the
general
ear
has
become
dulled
by
familiarity
with
it
and
is
no
longer
alert
no
longer
sensitive
to
such
affronts
no
one
in
the
world
speaks
blemishless
grammar
no
one
has
ever
written
it
no
one
either
in
the
world
or
out
of
it
taking
the
scriptures
for
evidence
on
the
latter
point
therefore
it
would
not
be
fair
to
exact
grammatical
perfection
from
the
peoples
of
the
valley
but
they
and
all
other
peoples
may
justly
be
required
to
refrain
from
knowingly
and
purposely
debauching
their
grammar
i
found
the
river
greatly
changed
at
island
no
the
island
which
i
remembered
was
some
three
miles
long
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
heavily
timbered
and
lay
near
the
kentucky
shore
within
two
hundred
yards
of
it
i
should
say
now
however
one
had
to
hunt
for
it
with
a
spy
glass
nothing
was
left
of
it
but
an
insignificant
little
tuft
and
this
was
no
longer
near
the
kentucky
shore
it
was
clear
over
against
the
opposite
shore
a
mile
away
in
war
times
the
island
had
been
an
important
place
for
it
commanded
the
situation
and
being
heavily
fortified
there
was
no
getting
by
it
it
lay
between
the
upper
and
lower
divisions
of
the
union
forces
and
kept
them
separate
until
a
junction
was
finally
effected
across
the
missouri
neck
of
land
but
the
island
being
itself
joined
to
that
neck
now
the
wide
river
is
without
obstruction
in
this
region
the
river
passes
from
kentucky
into
tennessee
back
into
missouri
then
back
into
kentucky
and
thence
into
tennessee
again
so
a
mile
or
two

into

the
town
of
new
madrid
was
looking
very
unwell
but
otherwise
unchanged
from
its
former
condition
and
aspect
its
blocks
of
frame
houses
were
still
grouped
in
the
same
old
flat
plain
and
environed
by
the
same
old
forests
it
was
as
tranquil
as
formerly
and
apparently
had
neither
grown
nor
diminished
in
size
it
was
said
that
the
recent
high
water
had
invaded
it
and
damaged
its
looks
this
was
surprising
news
for
in
low
water
the
river
bank
is
very
high
there
fifty
feet
and
in
my
day
an
overflow
had
always
been
considered
an
impossibility
this
present
flood
of
will
doubtless
be
celebrated
in
the
river's
history
for
several
generations
before
a
deluge
of
like
magnitude

be

all
the
unprotected

the
river
and
in
some

south
when
the
flood
was
at
its
highest
the
mississippi
was
seventy
miles
wide
a
number
of
lives
were
lost
and
the
destruction
of
property
was
fearful
the
crops
were
destroyed
houses
washed
away
and
shelterless
men
and
cattle
forced
to
take
refuge
on
scattering
elevations
here
and
there
in
field
and
forest
and
wait
in
peril
and
suffering
until
the
boats
put
in
commission
by
the
national
and
local
governments
and
by
newspaper
enterprise
could
come
and
rescue
them
the
properties
of
multitudes
of
people
were
under
water
for
months
and
the
poorer
ones
must
have
starved
by
the

had
not
been
promptly

the
loneliness
of

it

its

a
procession
which
kept
up
its
plodding
patient
march
through
the
land
during
many
many
years
each
tourist
took
notes
and
went
home
and
published
a
book
a
book
which
was
usually
calm
truthful
reasonable
kind
but
which
seemed
just
the
reverse
to
our
tender
footed
progenitors
a
glance
at
these
tourist
books
shows
us
that
in
certain
of
its
aspects
the
mississippi
has
undergone
no
change
since
those
strangers
visited
it
but
remains
to
day
about
as
it
was
then
the
emotions
produced
in
those
foreign
breasts
by
these
aspects
were
not
all
formed
on
one
pattern
of
course
they
had
to
be
various
along
at
first
because
the
earlier
tourists
were
obliged
to
originate
their
emotions
whereas
in
older
countries
one
can
always
borrow
emotions
from
one's
predecessors
and
mind
you
emotions
are
among
the
toughest
things
in
the
world
to
manufacture
out
of
whole
cloth
it
is
easier
to
manufacture
seven
facts
than
one
emotion
captain

r

writing
fifty
five
years

says
here
i
caught
the
first
glimpse
of
the
object
i
had
so
long
wished
to
behold
and
felt
myself
amply
repaid
at
that
moment
for
all
the
trouble
i
had
experienced
in
coming
so
far
and
stood
looking
at
the
river
flowing
past
till
it
was
too
dark
to
distinguish
anything
but
it
was
not
till
i
had
visited
the

spot
a
dozen
times
that
i
came

she
is
writing
a
few
months
later
in

and
is
coming
in
at
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
the
first
indication
of
our
approach
to
land
was
the
appearance
of
this
mighty
river
pouring
forth
its
muddy
mass
of
waters
and
mingling
with
the
deep
blue
of
the
mexican
gulf
i
never
beheld
a
scene
so
utterly
desolate
as
this
entrance
of
the
mississippi
had
dante
seen
it
he
might
have
drawn
images
of
another
borgia
from
its
horrors
one
only
object
rears
itself
above
the
eddying
waters
this
is
the
mast
of
a
vessel
long
since
wrecked
in
attempting
to
cross
the
bar
and
it
still
stands
a
dismal
witness
of
the

that
has
been

seven
years
later
it
is
only
when
you
ascend
the
mighty
current
for
fifty
or
a
hundred
miles
and
use
the
eye
of
imagination
as
well
as
that
of
nature
that
you
begin
to
understand
all
his
might
and
majesty
you
see
him
fertilizing
a
boundless
valley
bearing
along
in
his
course
the
trophies
of
his
thousand
victories
over
the
shattered
forest

carrying
away
large
masses
of
soil
with
all
their
growth
and
there
forming

at
some
future
period
to
be
the

while
indulging
in
this
prospect
it
is
then
time
for
reflection
to
suggest
that
the

before
you

an
instance

such
unvarying
and
unmitigated
crime
as
is
to
be
collected
from
the
history
of
the
turbulent
and
blood

mississippi
the
stream
itself
appears
as
if

it
is
not

the
sight
bestowing

in
its

not
one

the
eye
loves
to
dwell
upon
as
it
sweeps
along
nor

you
wander
upon
its
banks
or
trust
yourself
without
danger
to
its
stream
it
is
a
furious

desolating
torrent
loaded
with
alluvial
soil

of

who
are

into
its

was
a
foolish
superstition
of
some
little
prevalence
in
that
day
that
the
mississippi
would
neither
buoy
up
a
swimmer
nor
permit
a
drowned
person's
body
to
rise
to
the
surface
or

support
themselves

of

down
whole

disappear
in
tumultuous

as
if
in
anger
at
its
being
opposed
inundates
and
devastates
the
whole

as
soon
as
it
forces
its
way
through
its

in

direction
the

polluting
the

of
reminding
you

myself
afloat
upon

often
in

in

my

pictured

itself
the

and
now
they
neared
their
journey's
end
on
the
sixth
of
april
the
river
divided
itself
into
three
broad
channels
la
salle
followed
that
of
the
west
and
d'autray
that
of
the
east
while
tonty
took
the
middle
passage
as
he
drifted
down
the
turbid
current
between
the
low
and
marshy
shores
the
brackish
water
changed
to
brine
and
the
breeze
grew
fresh
with
the
salt
breath
of
the
sea
then
the
broad
bosom
of
the
great
gulf
opened
on
his
sight
tossing
its
restless
billows
limitless
voiceless
lonely
as
when
born
of
chaos
without
a
sail
without
a
sign
of
life
then
on
a
spot
of
solid
ground
la
salle
reared
a
column
bearing
the
arms
of
france
the
frenchmen
were
mustered
under
arms
and
while
the
new
england
indians
and
their
squaws
looked
on
in
wondering
silence
they
chanted
the
te
deum
the
exaudiat
and
the
domine
salvum
fac
regem
then
whilst
the
musketry
volleyed
and
rejoicing
shouts
burst
forth
the
victorious
discoverer
planted
the
column
and
made
proclamation
in
a
loud
voice
taking
formal
possession
of
the
river
and
the
vast
countries
watered
by
it
in
the
name
of
the
king
the
column
bore
this
inscription
louis
le
grand
roy
de
france
et
de
navarre
regne
le
neuvieme
avril
new
orleans
intended
to
fittingly
celebrate
this
present
year
the
bicentennial
anniversary
of
this
illustrious
event
but
when
the
time
came
all
her
energies
and
surplus
money
were
required
in
other
directions
for
the
flood
was
upon
the
land
then
making
havoc
and
devastation
everywhere
chapter
uncle
mumford
unloads
all
day
we
swung
along
down
the
river
and
had
the
stream
almost
wholly
to
ourselves
formerly
at
such
a
stage
of
the
water
we
should
have
passed
acres
of
lumber
rafts
and
dozens
of
big
coal
barges
also
occasional
little
trading
scows
peddling
along
from
farm
to
farm
with
the
peddler's
family
on
board
possibly
a
random
scow
bearing
a
humble
hamlet
and
co
on
an
itinerant
dramatic
trip
but
these
were
all
absent
far
along
in
the
day
we
saw
one
steamboat
just
one
and
no
more
she
was
lying
at
rest
in
the
shade
within
the
wooded
mouth
of
the
obion
river
the
spy
glass
revealed
the
fact
that
she
was
named
for
me
or
he
was
named
for
me
whichever
you
prefer
as
this
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
encountered
this
species
of
honor
it
seems
excusable
to
mention
it
and
at
the
same
time
call
the
attention
of
the
authorities
to
the
tardiness
of
my
recognition
of
it
noted
a
big
change
in
the
river
at
island
it
was
a
very
large
island
and
used
to
be
out
toward
mid
stream
but
it
is
joined
fast
to
the
main
shore
now
and
has
retired
from
business
as
an
island
as
we
approached
famous
and
formidable
plum
point
darkness
fell
but
that
was
nothing
to
shudder
about
in
these
modern
times
for
now
the
national
government
has
turned
the
mississippi
into
a
sort
of
two
thousand
mile
torchlight
procession
in
the
head
of
every
crossing
and
in
the
foot
of
every
crossing
the
government
has
set
up
a
clear
burning
lamp
you
are
never
entirely
in
the
dark
now
there
is
always
a
beacon
in
sight
either
before
you
or
behind
you
or
abreast
one
might
almost
say
that
lamps
have
been
squandered
there
dozens
of
crossings
are
lighted
which
were
not
shoal
when
they
were
created
and
have
never
been
shoal
since
crossings
so
plain
too
and
also
so
straight
that
a
steamboat
can
take
herself
through
them
without
any
help
after
she
has
been
through
once
lamps
in
such
places
are
of
course
not
wasted
it
is
much
more
convenient
and
comfortable
for
a
pilot
to
hold
on
them
than
on
a
spread
of
formless
blackness
that
won't
stay
still
and
money
is
saved
to
the
boat
at
the
same
time
for
she
can
of
course
make
more
miles
with
her
rudder
amidships
than
she
can
with
it
squared
across
her
stern
and
holding
her
back
but
this
thing
has
knocked
the
romance
out
of
piloting
to
a
large
extent
it
and
some
other
things
together
have
knocked
all
the
romance
out
of
it
for
instance
the
peril
from
snags
is
not
now
what
it
once
was
the
government's
snag
boats
go
patrolling
up
and
down
in
these
matter
of
fact
days
pulling
the
river's
teeth
they
have
rooted
out
all
the
old
clusters
which
made
many
localities
so
formidable
and
they
allow
no
new
ones
to
collect
formerly
if
your
boat
got
away
from
you
on
a
black
night
and
broke
for
the
woods
it
was
an
anxious
time
with
you
so
was
it
also
when
you
were
groping
your
way
through
solidified
darkness
in
a
narrow
chute
but
all
that
is
changed
now
you
flash
out
your
electric
light
transform
night
into
day
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
and
your
perils
and
anxieties
are
at
an
end
horace
bixby
and
george
ritchie
have
charted
the
crossings
and
laid
out
the
courses
by
compass
they
have
invented
a
lamp
to
go
with
the
chart
and
have
patented
the
whole
with
these
helps
one
may
run
in
the
fog
now
with
considerable
security
and
with
a
confidence
unknown
in
the
old
days
with
these
abundant
beacons
the
banishment
of
snags
plenty
of
daylight
in
a
box
and
ready
to
be
turned
on
whenever
needed
and
a
chart
and
compass
to
fight
the
fog
with
piloting
at
a
good
stage
of
water
is
now
nearly
as
safe
and
simple
as
driving
stage
and
is
hardly
more
than
three
times
as
romantic
and
now
in
these
new
days
these
days
of
infinite
change
the
anchor
line
have
raised
the
captain
above
the
pilot
by
giving
him
the
bigger
wages
of
the
two
this
was
going
far
but
they
have
not
stopped
there
they
have
decreed
that
the
pilot
shall
remain
at
his
post
and
stand
his
watch
clear
through
whether
the
boat
be
under
way
or
tied
up
to
the
shore
we
that
were
once
the
aristocrats
of
the
river
can't
go
to
bed
now
as
we
used
to
do
and
sleep
while
a
hundred
tons
of
freight
are
lugged
aboard
no
we
must
sit
in
the
pilot
house
and
keep
awake
too
verily
we
are
being
treated
like
a
parcel
of
mates
and
engineers
the
government
has
taken
away
the
romance
of
our
calling
the
company
has
taken
away
its
state
and
dignity
plum
point
looked
as
it
had
always
looked
by
night
with
the
exception
that
now
there
were
beacons
to
mark
the
crossings
and
also
a
lot
of
other
lights
on
the
point
and
along
its
shore
these
latter
glinting
from
the
fleet
of
the
united
states
river
commission
and
from
a
village
which
the
officials
have
built
on
the
land
for
offices
and
for
the
employees
of
the
service
the
military
engineers
of
the
commission
have
taken
upon
their
shoulders
the
job
of
making
the
mississippi
over
again
a
job
transcended
in
size
by
only
the
original
job
of
creating
it
they
are
building
wing
dams
here
and
there
to
deflect
the
current
and
dikes
to
confine
it
in
narrower
bounds
and
other
dikes
to
make
it
stay
there
and
for
unnumbered
miles
along
the
mississippi
they
are
felling
the
timber
front
for
fifty
yards
back
with
the
purpose
of
shaving
the
bank
down
to
low
water
mark
with
the
slant
of
a
house
roof
and
ballasting
it
with
stones
and
in
many
places
they
have
protected
the
wasting
shores
with
rows
of
piles
one
who
knows
the
mississippi
will
promptly
aver
not
aloud
but
to
himself
that
ten
thousand
river
commissions
with
the
mines
of
the
world
at
their
back
cannot
tame
that
lawless
stream
cannot
curb
it
or
confine
it
cannot
say
to
it
go
here
or
go
there
and
make
it
obey
cannot
save
a
shore
which
it
has
sentenced
cannot
bar
its
path
with
an
obstruction
which
it
will
not
tear
down
dance
over
and
laugh
at
but
a
discreet
man
will
not
put
these
things
into
spoken
words
for
the
west
point
engineers
have
not
their
superiors
anywhere
they
know
all
that
can
be
known
of
their
abstruse
science
and
so
since
they
conceive
that
they
can
fetter
and
handcuff
that
river
and
boss
him
it
is
but
wisdom
for
the
unscientific
man
to
keep
still
lie
low
and
wait
till
they
do
it
captain
eads
with
his
jetties
has
done
a
work
at
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
which
seemed
clearly
impossible
so
we
do
not
feel
full
confidence
now
to
prophesy
against
like
impossibilities
otherwise
one
would
pipe
out
and
say
the
commission
might
as
well
bully
the
comets
in
their
courses
and
undertake
to
make
them
behave
as
try
to
bully
the
mississippi
into
right
and
reasonable
conduct
i
consulted
uncle
mumford
concerning
this
and
cognate
matters
and
i
give
here
the
result
stenographically
reported
and
therefore
to
be
relied
on
as
being
full
and
correct
except
that
i
have
here
and
there
left
out
remarks
which
were
addressed
to
the
men
such
as
where
in
blazes
are
you
going
with
that
barrel
now
and
which
seemed
to
me
to
break
the
flow
of
the
written
statement
without
compensating
by
adding
to
its
information
or
its
clearness
not
that
i
have
ventured
to
strike
out
all
such
interjections
i
have
removed
only
those
which
were
obviously
irrelevant
wherever
one
occurred
which
i
felt
any
question
about
i
have
judged
it
safest
to
let
it
remain
uncle
mumford's
impressions
uncle
mumford
said
as
long
as
i
have
been
mate
of
a
steamboat
thirty
years
i
have
watched
this
river
and
studied
it
maybe
i
could
have
learnt
more
about
it
at
west
point
but
if
i
believe
it
i
wish
i
may
be
what
are
you
sucking
your
fingers
there
for
collar
that
kag
of
nails
four
years
at
west
point
and
plenty
of
books
and
schooling
will
learn
a
man
a
good
deal
i
reckon
but
it
won't
learn
him
the
river
you
turn
one
of
those
little
european
rivers
over
to
this
commission
with
its
hard
bottom
and
clear
water
and
it
would
just
be
a
holiday
job
for
them
to
wall
it
and
pile
it
and
dike
it
and
tame
it
down
and
boss
it
around
and
make
it
go
wherever
they
wanted
it
to
and
stay
where
they
put
it
and
do
just
as
they
said
every
time
but
this
ain't
that
kind
of
a
river
they
have
started
in
here
with
big
confidence
and
the
best
intentions
in
the
world
but
they
are
going
to
get
left
what
does
ecclesiastes
vii
say
says
enough
to
knock
their
little
game
galley
west
don't
it
now
you
look
at
their
methods
once
there
at
devil's
island
in
the
upper
river
they
wanted
the
water
to
go
one
way
the
water
wanted
to
go
another
so
they
put
up
a
stone
wall
but
what
does
the
river
care
for
a
stone
wall
when
it
got
ready
it
just
bulged
through
it
maybe
they
can
build
another
that
will
stay
that
is
up
there
but
not
down
here
they
can't
down
here
in
the
lower
river
they
drive
some
pegs
to
turn
the
water
away
from
the
shore
and
stop
it
from
slicing
off
the
bank
very
well
don't
it
go
straight
over
and
cut
somebody
else's
bank
certainly
are
they
going
to
peg
all
the
banks
why
they
could
buy
ground
and
build
a
new
mississippi
cheaper
they
are
pegging
bulletin
tow
head
now
it
won't
do
any
good
if
the
river
has
got
a
mortgage
on
that
island
it
will
foreclose
sure
pegs
or
no
pegs
away
down
yonder
they
have
driven
two
rows
of
piles
straight
through
the
middle
of
a
dry
bar
half
a
mile
long
which
is
forty
foot
out
of
the
water
when
the
river
is
low
what
do
you
reckon
that
is
for
if
i
know
i
wish
i
may
land
in
hump
yourself
you
son
of
an
undertaker
out
with
that
coal
oil
now
lively
lively
and
just
look
at
what
they
are
trying
to
do
down
there
at
milliken's
bend
there's
been
a
cut
off
in
that
section
and
vicksburg
is
left
out
in
the
cold
it's
a
country
town
now
the
river
strikes
in
below
it
and
a
boat
can't
go
up
to
the
town
except
in
high
water
well
they
are
going
to
build
wing
dams
in
the
bend
opposite
the
foot
of
and
throw
the
water
over
and
cut
off
the
foot
of
the
island
and
plow
down
into
an
old
ditch
where
the
river
used
to
be
in
ancient
times
and
they
think
they
can
persuade
the
water
around
that
way
and
get
it
to
strike
in
above
vicksburg
as
it
used
to
do
and
fetch
the
town
back
into
the
world
again
that
is
they
are
going
to
take
this
whole
mississippi
and
twist
it
around
and
make
it
run
several
miles
up
stream
well
you've
got
to
admire
men
that
deal
in
ideas
of
that
size
and
can
tote
them
around
without
crutches
but
you
haven't
got
to
believe
they
can
do
such
miracles
have
you
and
yet
you
ain't
absolutely
obliged
to
believe
they
can't
i
reckon
the
safe
way
where
a
man
can
afford
it
is
to
copper
the
operation
and
at
the
same
time
buy
enough
property
in
vicksburg
to
square
you
up
in
case
they
win
government
is
doing
a
deal
for
the
mississippi
now
spending
loads
of
money
on
her
when
there
used
to
be
four
thousand
steamboats
and
ten
thousand
acres
of
coal
barges
and
rafts
and
trading
scows
there
wasn't
a
lantern
from
st
paul
to
new
orleans
and
the
snags
were
thicker
than
bristles
on
a
hog's
back
and
now
when
there's
three
dozen
steamboats
and
nary
barge
or
raft
government
has
snatched
out
all
the
snags
and
lit
up
the
shores
like
broadway
and
a
boat's
as
safe
on
the
river
as
she'd
be
in
heaven
and
i
reckon
that
by
the
time
there
ain't
any
boats
left
at
all
the
commission
will
have
the
old
thing
all
reorganized
and
dredged
out
and
fenced
in
and
tidied
up
to
a
degree
that
will
make
navigation
just
simply
perfect
and
absolutely
safe
and
profitable
and
all
the
days
will
be
sundays
and
all
the
mates
will
be
sunday
school
su
what
in
the
nation
you
fooling
around
there
for
you
sons
of
unrighteousness
heirs
of
perdition
going
to
be
a
year
getting
that
hogshead
ashore
during
our
trip
to
new
orleans
and
back
we
had
many
conversations
with
river
men
planters
journalists
and
officers
of
the
river
commission
with
conflicting
and
confusing
results
to
wit
some
believed
in
the
commission's
scheme
to
arbitrarily
and
permanently
confine
and
thus
deepen
the
channel
preserve
threatened
shores
etc
some
believed
that
the
commission's
money
ought
to
be
spent
only
on
building
and
repairing
the
great
system
of
levees
some
believed
that
the
higher
you
build
your
levee
the
higher
the
river's
bottom
will
rise
and
that
consequently
the
levee
system
is
a
mistake
some
believed
in
the
scheme
to
relieve
the
river
in
flood
time
by
turning
its
surplus
waters
off
into
lake
borgne
etc
some
believed
in
the
scheme
of
northern
lake
reservoirs
to
replenish
the
mississippi
in
low
water
seasons
wherever
you
find
a
man
down
there
who
believes
in
one
of
these
theories
you
may
turn
to
the
next
man
and
frame
your
talk
upon
the
hypothesis
that
he
does
not
believe
in
that
theory
and
after
you
have
had
experience
you
do
not
take
this
course
doubtfully
or
hesitatingly
but
with
the
confidence
of
a
dying
murderer
converted
one
i
mean
for
you
will
have
come
to
know
with
a
deep
and
restful
certainty
that
you
are
not
going
to
meet
two
people
sick
of
the
same
theory
one
right
after

you

yet
his

is
not
all
to
your

only
part
of
it
for
he
is
like
your

physician
who
comes
and
cures
the
mumps
and
leaves
the
scarlet

behind
if
your

is
a

for

he
will
exhale
a

which

at

he
will
cure
you
of
any

the
five

that
may

got

i
have
had
all
the
five
and
had
them
bad
but
ask
me
not
in
mournful
numbers
which
one
racked
me
hardest
or
which
one
numbered
the
biggest
sick
list
for
i
do
not
know
in
truth
no
one
can
answer
the
latter
question
mississippi
improvement
is
a
mighty
topic
down
yonder
every
man
on
the
river
banks
south
of
cairo
talks
about
it
every
day
during
such
moments
as
he
is
able
to
spare
from
talking
about
the
war
and
each
of
the
several
chief
theories
has
its
host
of
zealous
partisans
but
as
i
have
said
it
is
not
possible
to
determine
which
cause
numbers
the
most
recruits
all
were
agreed
upon
one
point
however
if
congress
would
make
a
sufficient
appropriation
a
colossal
benefit
would
result
very
well
since
then
the
appropriation
has
been
made
possibly
a
sufficient
one
certainly
not
too
large
a
one
let
us
hope
that
the
prophecy
will
be
amply
fulfilled
one
thing
will
be
easily
granted
by
the
reader
that
an
opinion
from
mr
edward
atkinson
upon
any
vast
national
commercial
matter
comes
as
near
ranking
as
authority
as
can
the
opinion
of
any
individual
in
the
union
what
he
has
to
say
about
mississippi
river
improvement
will
be
found
in
the
appendix

sometimes
half
a

the

which
ten

labored
words
with
the

purpose
in

had
left
at

but
dim
and
uncertain
here
is
a

of
the
sort
paragraph

on

thirty
two
barges
containing
six
hundred
thousand
bushels
seventy
six
pounds
to
the
bushel
of
coal
exclusive
of
her
own

being
the
largest
tow
ever
taken
to
new

or
anywhere
else
in
the
world
her
freight
bill
at

a

amounts
to
it
would
take
eighteen
hundred
cars
of
three
hundred
and
thirty
three
bushels
to
the
car
to
transport
this
amount
of
coal
at
per
ton
or
per
car
which
would
be
a
fair
price
for
the
distance
by
rail
the
freight
bill
would
amount
to
or
more
by
rail
than
by
river
the
tow
will
be
taken
from
pittsburg
to
new
orleans
in
fourteen
or
fifteen
days
it
would
take
one
hundred
trains
of
eighteen
cars
to
the
train
to
transport
this
one
tow
of
six
hundred
thousand
bushels
of
coal
and
even
if
it
made
the
usual
speed
of
fast
freight
lines
it
would
take
one
whole
summer
to
put
it
through
by
rail
when
a
river
in
good
condition
can
enable
one
to
save
and
a
whole
summer's
time
on
a
single
cargo
the
wisdom
of
taking
measures
to
keep
the
river
in
good
condition
is
made
plain
to
even
the
uncommercial
mind
chapter

we
passed
through
the
plum
point
region
turned
craighead's
point
and
glided
unchallenged
by
what
was
once
the
formidable
fort
pillow
memorable
because
of
the
massacre
perpetrated
there
during
the
war
massacres
are
sprinkled
with
some
frequency
through
the
histories
of
several
christian
nations
but
this
is
almost
the
only
one
that
can
be
found
in
american
history
perhaps
it
is
the
only
one
which
rises
to
a
size
correspondent
to
that
huge
and
somber
title
we
have
the
boston
massacre
where
two
or
three
people
were
killed
but
we
must
bunch
anglo
saxon
history
together
to
find
the
fellow
to
the
fort
pillow
tragedy
and
doubtless
even
then
we
must
travel
back
to
the
days
and
the
performances
of
coeur
de

that
fine
hero
before
we
accomplish
it
more
of
the
river's
freaks
in
times
past
the
channel
used
to
strike
above
island
by
brandywine
bar
and
down
towards
island
afterward
changed
its
course
and
went
from
brandywine
down
through
vogelman's
chute
in
the
devil's
elbow
to
island
part
of
this
course
reversing
the
old
order
the
river
running
up
four
or
five
miles
instead
of
down
and
cutting
off
throughout
some
fifteen
miles
of
distance
this
in
all
that
region
is
now
called
centennial
island
there
is
a
tradition
that
island
was
one
of
the
principal
abiding
places
of
the
once
celebrated
murel's
gang
this
was
a
colossal
combination
of
robbers
horse
thieves
negro
stealers
and
counterfeiters
engaged
in
business
along
the
river
some
fifty
or
sixty
years
ago
while
our
journey
across
the
country
towards
st
louis
was
in
progress
we
had
had
no
end
of
jesse
james
and
his
stirring
history
for
he
had
just
been
assassinated
by
an
agent
of
the
governor
of
missouri
and
was
in
consequence
occupying
a
good
deal
of
space
in
the
newspapers
cheap
histories
of
him
were
for
sale
by
train
boys
according
to
these
he
was
the
most
marvelous
creature
of
his
kind
that
had
ever
existed
it
was
a
mistake
murel
was
his
equal
in
boldness
in
pluck
in
rapacity
in
cruelty
brutality
heartlessness
treachery
and
in
general
and
comprehensive
vileness
and
shamelessness
and
very
much
his
superior
in
some
larger
aspects
james
was
a
retail
rascal
murel
wholesale
james's
modest
genius
dreamed
of
no
loftier
flight
than
the
planning
of
raids
upon
cars
coaches
and
country
banks
murel
projected
negro
insurrections
and
the
capture
of
new
orleans
and
furthermore
on
occasion
this
murel
could
go
into
a
pulpit
and
edify
the
congregation
what
are
james
and
his
half
dozen
vulgar
rascals
compared
with
this
stately
old
time
criminal
with
his
sermons
his
meditated
insurrections
and
city
captures
and
his
majestic
following
of
ten
hundred
men
sworn
to
do
his
evil
will
here
is
a
paragraph
or
two
concerning
this
big
operator
from
a
now
forgotten
book
which
was
published
half
a
century
ago
he
appears
to
have
been
a
most
dexterous
as
well
as
consummate
villain
when
he
traveled
his
usual
disguise
was
that
of
an
itinerant
preacher
and
it
is
said
that
his
discourses
were
very
soul
moving
interesting
the
hearers
so
much
that
they
forgot
to
look
after
their
horses
which
were
carried
away
by
his
confederates
while
he
was
preaching
but
the
stealing
of
horses
in
one
state
and
selling
them
in
another
was
but
a
small
portion
of
their
business
the
most
lucrative
was
the
enticing
slaves
to
run
away
from
their
masters
that
they
might
sell
them
in
another
quarter
this
was
arranged
as
follows
they
would
tell
a
negro
that
if
he
would
run
away
from
his
master
and
allow
them
to
sell
him
he
should
receive
a
portion
of
the
money
paid
for
him
and
that
upon
his
return
to
them
a
second
time
they
would
send
him
to
a
free
state
where
he
would
be
safe
the
poor
wretches
complied
with
this
request
hoping
to
obtain
money
and
freedom
they
would
be
sold
to
another
master
and
run
away
again
to
their
employers
sometimes
they
would
be
sold
in
this
manner
three
or
four
times
until
they
had
realized
three
or
four
thousand
dollars
by
them
but
as
after
this
there
was
fear
of
detection
the
usual
custom
was
to
get
rid
of
the
only
witness
that
could
be
produced
against
them
which
was
the
negro
himself
by
murdering
him
and
throwing
his
body
into
the
mississippi
even
if
it
was
established
that
they
had
stolen
a
negro
before
he
was
murdered
they
were
always
prepared
to
evade
punishment
for
they
concealed
the
negro
who
had
run
away
until
he
was
advertised
and
a
reward
offered
to
any
man
who
would
catch
him
an
advertisement
of
this
kind
warrants
the
person
to
take
the
property
if
found
and
then
the
negro
becomes
a
property
in
trust
when
therefore
they
sold
the
negro
it
only
became
a
breach
of
trust
not
stealing
and
for
a
breach
of
trust
the
owner
of
the
property
can
only
have
redress
by
a
civil
action
which
was
useless
as
the
damages
were
never
paid
it
may
be
inquired
how
it
was
that
murel
escaped
lynch
law
under
such
circumstances
this
will
be
easily
understood
when
it
is
stated
that
he
had
more
than
a
thousand
sworn
confederates
all
ready
at
a
moment's
notice
to
support
any
of
the
gang
who
might
be
in
trouble
the
names
of
all
the
principal
confederates
of
murel
were
obtained
from
himself
in
a
manner
which
i
shall
presently
explain
the
gang
was
composed
of
two
classes
the
heads
or
council
as
they
were
called
who
planned
and
concerted
but
seldom
acted
they
amounted
to
about
four
hundred
the
other
class
were
the
active
agents
and
were
termed
strikers
and
amounted
to
about
six
hundred
and
fifty
these
were
the
tools
in
the
hands
of
the
others
they
ran
all
the
risk
and
received
but
a
small
portion
of
the
money
they
were
in
the
power
of
the
leaders
of
the
gang
who
would
sacrifice
them
at
any
time
by
handing
them
over
to
justice
or
sinking
their
bodies
in
the
mississippi
the
general
rendezvous
of
this
gang
of
miscreants
was
on
the
arkansas
side
of
the
river
where
they
concealed
their
negroes
in
the
morasses
and
cane
brakes
the
depredations
of
this
extensive
combination
were
severely
felt
but
so
well
were
their
plans
arranged
that
although
murel
who
was
always
active
was
everywhere
suspected
there
was
no
proof
to
be
obtained
it
so
happened
however
that
a
young
man
of
the
name
of
stewart
who
was
looking
after
two
slaves
which
murel
had
decoyed
away
fell
in
with
him
and
obtained
his
confidence
took
the
oath
and
was
admitted
into
the
gang
as
one
of
the
general
council
by
this
means
all
was
discovered
for
stewart
turned
traitor
although
he
had
taken
the
oath
and
having
obtained
every
information
exposed
the
whole
concern
the
names
of
all
the
parties
and
finally
succeeded
in
bringing
home
sufficient
evidence
against
murel
to
procure
his
conviction
and
sentence
to
the
penitentiary
murel
was
sentenced
to
fourteen
years
imprisonment
so
many
people
who
were
supposed
to
be
honest
and
bore
a
respectable
name
in
the
different
states
were
found
to
be
among
the
list
of
the
grand
council
as
published
by
stewart
that
every
attempt
was
made
to
throw
discredit
upon
his
assertions
his
character
was
vilified
and
more
than
one
attempt
was
made
to
assassinate
him
he
was
obliged
to
quit
the
southern
states
in
consequence
it
is
however
now
well
ascertained
to
have
been
all
true
and
although
some
blame
mr
stewart
for
having
violated
his
oath
they
no
longer
attempt
to
deny
that
his
revelations
were
correct
i
will
quote
one
or
two
portions
of
murel's
confessions
to
mr
stewart
made
to
him
when
they
were
journeying
together
i
ought
to
have
observed
that
the
ultimate
intentions
of
murel
and
his
associates
were
by
his
own
account
on
a
very
extended
scale
having
no
less
an
object
in
view
than
raising
the
blacks
against
the
whites
taking
possession
of
and
plundering
new
orleans
and
making
themselves
possessors
of
the
territory
the
following
are
a
few
extracts
i
collected
all
my
friends
about
new
orleans
at
one
of
our
friends
houses
in
that
place
and
we
sat
in
council
three
days
before
we
got
all
our
plans
to
our
notion
we
then
determined
to
undertake
the
rebellion
at
every
hazard
and
make
as
many
friends
as
we
could
for
that
purpose
every
man's
business
being
assigned
him
i
started
to
natchez
on
foot
having
sold
my
horse
in
new
orleans
with
the
intention
of
stealing
another
after
i
started
i
walked
four
days
and
no
opportunity
offered
for
me
to
get
a
horse
the
fifth
day
about
twelve
i
had
become
tired
and
stopped
at
a
creek
to
get
some
water
and
rest
a
little
while
i
was
sitting
on
a
log
looking
down
the
road
the
way
that
i
had
come
a
man
came
in
sight
riding
on
a
good
looking
horse
the
very
moment
i
saw
him
i
was
determined
to
have
his
horse
if
he
was
in
the
garb
of
a
traveler
he
rode
up
and
i
saw
from
his
equipage
that
he
was
a
traveler
i
arose
and
drew
an
elegant
rifle
pistol
on
him
and
ordered
him
to
dismount
he
did
so
and
i
took
his
horse
by
the
bridle
and
pointed
down
the
creek
and
ordered
him
to
walk
before
me
he
went
a
few
hundred
yards
and
stopped
i
hitched
his
horse
and
then
made
him
undress
himself
all
to
his
shirt
and
drawers
and
ordered
him
to
turn
his
back
to
me
he
said
if
you
are
determined
to
kill
me
let
me
have
time
to
pray
before
i
die
i
told
him
i
had
no
time
to
hear
him
pray
he
turned
around
and
dropped
on
his
knees
and
i
shot
him
through
the
back
of
the
head
i
ripped
open
his
belly
and
took
out
his
entrails
and
sunk
him
in
the
creek
i
then
searched
his
pockets
and
found
four
hundred
dollars
and
thirty
seven
cents
and
a
number
of
papers
that
i
did
not
take
time
to
examine
i
sunk
the
pocket
book
and
papers
and
his
hat
in
the
creek
his
boots
were
brand
new
and
fitted
me
genteelly
and
i
put
them
on
and
sunk
my
old
shoes
in
the
creek
to
atone
for
them
i
rolled
up
his
clothes
and
put
them
into
his
portmanteau
as
they
were
brand
new
cloth
of
the
best
quality
i
mounted
as
fine
a
horse
as
ever
i
straddled
and
directed
my
course
for
natchez
in
much
better
style
than
i
had
been
for
the
last
five
days
myself
and
a
fellow
by
the
name
of
crenshaw
gathered
four
good
horses
and
started
for
georgia
we
got
in
company
with
a
young
south
carolinian
just
before
we
got
to
cumberland
mountain
and
crenshaw
soon
knew
all
about
his
business
he
had
been
to
tennessee
to
buy
a
drove
of
hogs
but
when
he
got
there
pork
was
dearer
than
he
calculated
and
he
declined
purchasing
we
concluded
he
was
a
prize
crenshaw
winked
at
me
i
understood
his
idea
crenshaw
had
traveled
the
road
before
but
i
never
had
we
had
traveled
several
miles
on
the
mountain
when
he
passed
near
a
great
precipice
just
before
we
passed
it
crenshaw
asked
me
for
my
whip
which
had
a
pound
of
lead
in
the
butt
i
handed
it
to
him
and
he
rode
up
by
the
side
of
the
south
carolinian
and
gave
him
a
blow
on
the
side
of
the
head
and
tumbled
him
from
his
horse
we
lit
from
our
horses
and
fingered
his
pockets
we
got
twelve
hundred
and
sixty
two
dollars
crenshaw
said
he
knew
a
place
to
hide
him
and
he
gathered
him
under
his
arms
and
i
by
his
feet
and
conveyed
him
to
a
deep
crevice
in
the
brow
of
the
precipice
and
tumbled
him
into
it
and
he
went
out
of
sight
we
then
tumbled
in
his
saddle
and
took
his
horse
with
us
which
was
worth
two
hundred
dollars
we
were
detained
a
few
days
and
during
that
time
our
friend
went
to
a
little
village
in
the
neighborhood
and
saw
the
negro
advertised
a
negro
in
our
possession
and
a
description
of
the
two
men
of
whom
he
had
been
purchased
and
giving
his
suspicions
of
the
men
it
was
rather
squally
times
but
any
port
in
a
storm
we
took
the
negro
that
night
on
the
bank
of
a
creek
which
runs
by
the
farm
of
our
friend
and
crenshaw
shot
him
through
the
head
we
took
out
his
entrails
and
sunk
him
in
the
creek
he
had
sold
the
other
negro
the
third
time
on
arkansaw
river
for
upwards
of
five
hundred
dollars
and
then
stole
him
and
delivered
him
into
the
hand
of
his
friend
who
conducted
him
to
a
swamp
and
veiled
the
tragic
scene
and
got
the
last
gleanings
and
sacred
pledge
of
secrecy
as
a
game
of
that
kind
will
not
do
unless
it
ends
in
a
mystery
to
all
but
the
fraternity
he
sold
the
negro
first
and
last
for
nearly
two
thousand
dollars
and
then
put
him
for
ever
out
of
the
reach
of
all
pursuers
and
they
can
never
graze
him
unless
they
can
find
the
negro
and
that
they
cannot
do
for
his
carcass
has
fed
many
a
tortoise
and
catfish
before
this
time
and
the
frogs
have
sung
this
many
a
long
day
to
the
silent
repose
of
his
skeleton
we
were
approaching
memphis
in
front
of
which
city
and
witnessed
by
its
people
was
fought
the
most
famous
of
the
river
battles
of
the
civil
war
two
men
whom
i
had
served
under
in
my
river
days
took
part
in
that
fight
mr
bixby
head
pilot
of
the
union
fleet
and
montgomery
commodore
of
the
confederate
fleet
both
saw
a
great
deal
of
active
service
during
the
war
and
achieved
high
reputations
for
pluck
and
capacity
as
we
neared
memphis
we
began
to
cast
about
for
an
excuse
to
stay
with
the
gold
dust
to
the
end
of
her
course
vicksburg
we
were
so
pleasantly
situated
that
we
did
not
wish
to
make
a
change
i
had
an
errand
of
considerable
importance
to
do
at
napoleon
arkansas
but
perhaps
i
could
manage
it
without
quitting
the
gold
dust
i
said
as
much
so
we
decided
to
stick
to
present
quarters
the
boat
was
to
tarry
at
memphis
till
ten
the
next
morning
it
is
a
beautiful
city
nobly
situated
on
a
commanding
bluff
overlooking
the
river
the
streets
are
straight
and
spacious
though
not
paved
in
a
way
to
incite
distempered
admiration
no
the
admiration
must
be
reserved
for
the
town's
sewerage
system
which
is
called
perfect
a
recent
reform
however
for
it
was
just
the
other
way
up
to
a
few
years
ago
a
reform
resulting
from
the
lesson
taught
by
a
desolating
visitation
of
the
yellow
fever
in
those
awful
days
the
people
were
swept
off
by
hundreds
by
thousands
and
so
great
was
the
reduction
caused
by
flight
and
by
death
together
that
the
population
was
diminished
three
fourths
and
so
remained
for
a
time
business
stood
nearly
still
and
the
streets
bore
an
empty
sunday
aspect
here
is
a
picture
of
memphis
at
that
disastrous
time
drawn
by
a
german
tourist
who
seems
to
have
been
an
eye
witness
of
the
scenes
which
he
describes
it
is
from
chapter
vii
of
his
book
just
published
in
leipzig
mississippi
fahrten
von

hesse
wartegg
in
august
the
yellow
fever
had
reached
its
extremest
height
daily
hundreds
fell
a
sacrifice
to
the
terrible
epidemic
the
city
was
become
a
mighty
graveyard
two
thirds
of
the
population
had
deserted
the
place
and
only
the
poor
the
aged
and
the
sick
remained
behind
a
sure
prey
for
the
insidious
enemy
the
houses
were
closed
little
lamps
burned
in
front
of
many
a
sign
that
here
death
had
entered
often
several
lay
dead
in
a
single
house
from
the
windows
hung
black
crape
the
stores
were
shut
up
for
their
owners
were
gone
away
or
dead
fearful
evil
in
the
briefest
space
it
struck
down
and
swept
away
even
the
most
vigorous
victim
a
slight
indisposition
then
an
hour
of
fever
then
the
hideous
delirium
then
the
yellow
death
on
the
street
corners
and
in
the
squares
lay
sick
men
suddenly
overtaken
by
the
disease
and
even
corpses
distorted
and
rigid
food
failed
meat
spoiled
in
a
few
hours
in
the
fetid
and
pestiferous
air
and
turned
black
fearful
clamors
issue
from
many
houses
then
after
a
season
they
cease
and
all
is
still
noble
self
sacrificing
men
come
with
the
coffin
nail
it
up
and
carry
it
away
to
the
graveyard
in
the
night
stillness
reigns
only
the
physicians
and
the
hearses
hurry
through
the
streets
and
out
of
the
distance
at
intervals
comes
the
muffled
thunder
of
the
railway
train
which
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
and
as
if
hunted
by
furies
flies
by
the
pest
ridden
city
without
halting
but
there
is
life
enough
there
now
the
population
exceeds
forty
thousand
and
is
augmenting
and
trade
is
in
a
flourishing
condition
we
drove
about
the
city
visited
the
park
and
the
sociable
horde
of
squirrels
there
saw
the
fine
residences
rose
clad
and
in
other
ways
enticing
to
the
eye
and
got
a
good
breakfast
at
the
hotel
a
thriving
place
is
the
good
samaritan
city
of
the
mississippi
has
a
great
wholesale
jobbing

foundries

and
manufactories
of

before
out
from
her
healthy
commercial
heart

five
trunk
lines
of

and
a
sixth
is
being
added
this
is
a
very
different
memphis
from
the
one
which
the
vanished
and
unremembered
procession
of
foreign
tourists
used
to
put
into
their
books
long
time
ago
in
the
days
of
the
now
forgotten
but
once
renowned
and
vigorously
hated
mrs
trollope
memphis
seems
to
have
consisted
mainly
of
one
long
street
of
log
houses
with
some
outlying
cabins
sprinkled
around
rearward
toward
the
woods
and
now
and
then
a
pig
and
no
end
of
mud
that
was
fifty
five
years
ago
she
stopped
at
the
hotel
plainly
it
was
not
the
one
which
gave
us
our
breakfast
she
says
the
table
was
laid
for
fifty
persons
and
was
nearly
full
they
ate
in
perfect
silence
and
with
such
astonishing
rapidity
that
their
dinner
was
over
literally
before
ours
was
begun
the
only
sounds
heard
were
those
produced
by
the
knives
and
forks
with
the
unceasing
chorus
of
coughing
etc
coughing
etc
the
etc
stands
for
an
unpleasant
word
there
a
word
which
she
does
not
always
charitably
cover
up
but
sometimes
prints
you
will
find
it
in
the
following
description
of
a
steamboat
dinner
which
she
ate
in
company
with
a
lot
of
aristocratic
planters
wealthy
well
born
ignorant
swells
they
were
tinselled
with
the
usual
harmless
military
and
judicial
titles
of
that
old
day
of
cheap
shams
and
windy
pretense
the
total
want
of
all
the
usual
courtesies
of
the
table
the
voracious
rapidity
with
which
the
viands
were
seized
and
devoured
the
strange
uncouth
phrases
and
pronunciation
the
loathsome
spitting
from
the
contamination
of
which
it
was
absolutely
impossible
to
protect
our
dresses
the
frightful
manner
of
feeding
with
their
knives
till
the
whole
blade
seemed
to
enter
into
the
mouth
and
the
still
more
frightful
manner
of
cleaning
the
teeth
afterward
with
a
pocket
knife
soon
forced
us
to
feel
that
we
were
not
surrounded
by
the
generals
colonels
and
majors
of
the
old
world
and
that
the
dinner
hour
was
to
be
anything
rather
than
an
hour
of
enjoyment

there
was

down

up
the

and
down
the
river
again

yet
again
and
again
and
handed
the

over
to
the
relieving
pilot
at
the
end
of
three
hours
of
honest
endeavor
at
the
same
old
foot
of
the
island

he
had
originally
taken
the

a

who
had
observed

anecdote
illustrative
of
influence
of
reputation
in
the
changing
of
opinion
the
eclipse
was
renowned
for
her
swiftness
one
day
she
passed
along
an
old
darkey
on
shore
absorbed
in
his
own
matters
did
not
notice
what
steamer
it
was
presently
someone
asked
any
boat
gone
up
yes
sah
was
she
going
fast
oh
so
so
loafin
along
now
do
you
know
what
boat
that
was
no
sah
why
uncle
that
was
the
eclipse
no
is
dat
so
well
i
bet
it
was
cause
she
jes
went
by
here
a
sparklin
piece
of
history
illustrative
of
the
violent
style
of
some
of
the
people
down
along
here
during
the
early
weeks
of
high
water
a's
fence
rails
washed
down
on
b's
ground
and
b's
rails
washed
up
in
the
eddy
and
landed
on
a's
ground
a
said
let
the
thing
remain
so
i
will
use
your
rails
and
you
use
mine
but
b
objected
wouldn't
have
it
so
one
day
a
came
down
on
b's
ground
to
get
his
rails
b
said
i'll
kill
you
and
proceeded
for
him
with
his
revolver
a
said
i'm
not
armed
so
b
who
wished
to
do
only
what
was
right
threw
down
his
revolver
then
pulled
a
knife
and
cut
a's
throat
all
around
but
gave
his
principal
attention
to
the
front
and
so
failed
to
sever
the
jugular
struggling
around
a
managed
to
get
his
hands
on
the
discarded
revolver
and
shot
b
dead
with
it
and
recovered
from
his
own
injuries
further
gossip
after
which
everybody
went
below
to
get
afternoon
coffee
and
left
me
at
the
wheel
alone
something
presently
reminded
me
of
our
last
hour
in
st
louis
part
of
which
i
spent
on
this
boat's
hurricane
deck
aft
i
was
joined
there
by
a
stranger
who
dropped
into
conversation
with
me
a
brisk
young
fellow
who
said
he
was
born
in
a
town
in
the
interior
of
wisconsin
and
had
never
seen
a
steamboat
until
a
week
before
also
said
that
on
the
way
down
from
la
crosse
he
had
inspected
and
examined
his
boat
so
diligently
and
with
such
passionate
interest
that
he
had
mastered
the
whole
thing
from
stem
to
rudder
blade
asked
me
where
i
was
from
i
answered
new
england
oh
a
yank
said
he
and
went
chatting
straight
along
without
waiting
for
assent
or
denial
he
immediately
proposed
to
take
me
all
over
the
boat
and
tell
me
the
names
of
her
different
parts
and
teach
me
their
uses
before
i
could
enter
protest
or
excuse
he
was
already
rattling
glibly
away
at
his
benevolent
work
and
when
i
perceived
that
he
was
misnaming
the
things
and
inhospitably
amusing
himself
at
the
expense
of
an
innocent
stranger
from
a
far
country
i
held
my
peace
and
let
him
have
his
way
he
gave
me
a
world
of
misinformation
and
the
further
he
went
the
wider
his
imagination
expanded
and
the
more
he
enjoyed
his
cruel
work
of
deceit
sometimes
after
palming
off
a
particularly
fantastic
and
outrageous
lie
upon
me
he
was
so
full
of
laugh
that
he
had
to
step
aside
for
a
minute
upon
one
pretext
or
another
to
keep
me
from
suspecting
i
staid
faithfully
by
him
until
his
comedy
was
finished
then
he
remarked
that
he
had
undertaken
to
learn
me
all
about
a
steamboat
and
had
done
it
but
that
if
he
had
overlooked
anything
just
ask
him
and
he
would
supply
the
lack
anything
about
this
boat
that
you
don't
know
the
name
of
or
the
purpose
of
you
come
to
me
and
i'll
tell
you
i
said
i
would
and
took
my
departure
disappeared
and
approached
him
from
another
quarter
whence
he
could
not
see
me
there
he
sat
all
alone
doubling
himself
up
and
writhing
this
way
and
that
in
the
throes
of
unappeasable
laughter
he
must
have
made
himself
sick
for
he
was
not
publicly
visible
afterward
for
several
days
meantime
the
episode
dropped
out
of
my
mind
the
thing
that
reminded
me
of
it
now
when
i
was
alone
at
the
wheel
was
the
spectacle
of
this
young
fellow
standing
in
the
pilot
house
door
with
the
knob
in
his
hand
silently
and
severely
inspecting
me
i
don't
know
when
i
have
seen
anybody
look
so
injured
as
he
did
he
did
not
say
anything
simply
stood
there
and
looked
reproachfully
looked
and
pondered
finally
he
shut
the
door
and
started
away
halted
on
the
texas
a
minute
came
slowly
back
and
stood
in
the
door
again
with
that
grieved
look
in
his
face
gazed
upon
me
awhile
in
meek
rebuke
then
said
you
let
me
learn
you
all
about
a
steamboat
didn't
you
yes
i
confessed
yes
you
did
didn't
you
yes
you
are
the
feller
that
that
language
failed
pause
impotent
struggle
for
further
words
then
he
gave
it
up
choked
out
a
deep
strong
oath
and
departed
for
good
afterward
i
saw
him
several
times
below
during
the
trip
but
he
was
cold
would
not
look
at
me
idiot
if
he
had
not
been
in
such
a
sweat
to
play
his
witless
practical
joke
upon
me
in
the
beginning
i
would
have
persuaded
his
thoughts
into
some
other
direction
and
saved
him
from
committing
that
wanton
and
silly
impoliteness
i
had
myself
called
with
the
four
o'clock
watch
mornings
for
one
cannot
see
too
many
summer
sunrises
on
the
mississippi
they
are
enchanting
first
there
is
the
eloquence
of
silence
for
a
deep
hush
broods
everywhere
next
there
is
the
haunting
sense
of
loneliness
isolation
remoteness
from
the
worry
and
bustle
of
the
world
the
dawn
creeps
in
stealthily
the
solid
walls
of
black
forest
soften
to
gray
and
vast
stretches
of
the
river
open
up
and
reveal
themselves
the
water
is
glass
smooth
gives
off
spectral
little
wreaths
of
white
mist
there
is
not
the
faintest
breath
of
wind
nor
stir
of
leaf
the
tranquillity
is
profound
and
infinitely
satisfying
then
a
bird
pipes
up
another
follows
and
soon
the
pipings
develop
into
a
jubilant
riot
of
music
you
see
none
of
the
birds
you
simply
move
through
an
atmosphere
of
song
which
seems
to
sing
itself
when
the
light
has
become
a
little
stronger
you
have
one
of
the
fairest
and
softest
pictures
imaginable
you
have
the
intense
green
of
the
massed
and
crowded
foliage
near
by
you
see
it
paling
shade
by
shade
in
front
of
you
upon
the
next
projecting
cape
a
mile
off
or
more
the
tint
has
lightened
to
the
tender
young
green
of
spring
the
cape
beyond
that
one
has
almost
lost
color
and
the
furthest
one
miles
away
under
the
horizon
sleeps
upon
the
water
a
mere
dim
vapor
and
hardly
separable
from
the
sky
above
it
and
about
it
and
all
this
stretch
of
river
is
a
mirror
and
you
have
the
shadowy
reflections
of
the
leafage
and
the
curving
shores
and
the
receding
capes
pictured
in
it
well
that
is
all
beautiful
soft
and
rich
and
beautiful
and
when
the
sun
gets
well
up
and
distributes
a
pink
flush
here
and
a
powder
of
gold
yonder
and
a
purple
haze
where
it
will
yield
the
best
effect
you
grant
that
you
have
seen
something
that
is
worth
remembering
we
had
the
kentucky
bend
country
in
the
early
morning
scene
of
a
strange
and
tragic
accident
in
the
old
times
captain
poe
had
a
small
stern
wheel
boat
for
years
the
home
of
himself
and
his
wife
one
night
the
boat
struck
a
snag
in
the
head
of
kentucky
bend
and
sank
with
astonishing
suddenness
water
already
well
above
the
cabin
floor
when
the
captain
got
aft
so
he
cut
into
his
wife's
state
room
from
above
with
an
ax
she
was
asleep
in
the
upper
berth
the
roof
a
flimsier
one
than
was
supposed
the
first
blow
crashed
down
through
the
rotten
boards
and
clove
her
skull
this
bend
is
all
filled
up
now
result
of
a
cut
off
and
the
same
agent
has
taken
the
great
and
once
much
frequented
walnut
bend
and
set
it
away
back
in
a
solitude
far
from
the
accustomed
track
of
passing
steamers
helena
we
visited
and
also
a
town
i
had
not
heard
of
before
it
being
of
recent
birth
arkansas
city
it
was
born
of
a
railway
the
little
rock
mississippi
river
and
texas
railroad
touches
the
river
there
we
asked
a
passenger
who
belonged
there
what
sort
of
a
place
it
was
well
said
he
after
considering
and
with
the
air
of
one
who
wishes
to
take
time
and
be
accurate
it's
a
hell
of
a
place
a
description
which
was
photographic
for
exactness
there
were
several
rows
and
clusters
of
shabby
frame
houses
and
a
supply
of
mud
sufficient
to
insure
the
town
against
a
famine
in
that
article
for
a
hundred
years
for
the
overflow
had
but
lately
subsided
there
were
stagnant
ponds
in
the
streets
here
and
there
and
a
dozen
rude
scows
were
scattered
about
lying
aground
wherever
they
happened
to
have
been
when
the
waters
drained
off
and
people
could
do
their
visiting
and
shopping
on
foot
once
more
still
it
is
a
thriving
place
with
a
rich
country
behind
it
an
elevator
in
front
of
it
and
also
a
fine
big
mill
for
the
manufacture
of
cotton
seed
oil
i
had
never
seen
this
kind
of
a
mill
before
cotton
seed
was
comparatively
valueless
in
my
time
but
it
is
worth
or
a
ton
now
and
none
of
it
is
thrown
away
the
oil
made
from
it
is
colorless
tasteless
and
almost
if
not
entirely
odorless
it
is
claimed
that
it
can
by
proper
manipulation
be
made
to
resemble
and
perform
the
office
of
any
and
all
oils
and
be
produced
at
a
cheaper
rate
than
the
cheapest
of
the
originals
sagacious
people
shipped
it
to
italy
doctored
it
labeled
it
and
brought
it
back
as
olive
oil
this
trade
grew
to
be
so
formidable
that
italy
was
obliged
to
put
a
prohibitory
impost
upon
it
to
keep
it
from
working
serious
injury
to
her
oil
industry
helena
occupies
one
of
the
prettiest
situations
on
the
mississippi
her
perch
is
the
last
the
southernmost
group
of
hills
which
one
sees
on
that
side
of
the
river
in
its
normal
condition
it
is
a
pretty
town
but
the
flood
or
possibly
the
seepage
had
lately
been
ravaging
it
whole
streets
of
houses
had
been
invaded
by
the
muddy
water
and
the
outsides
of
the
buildings
were
still
belted
with
a
broad
stain
extending
upwards
from
the
foundations
stranded
and
discarded
scows
lay
all
about
plank
sidewalks
on
stilts
four
feet
high
were
still
standing
the
board
sidewalks
on
the
ground
level
were
loose
and
ruinous
a
couple
of
men
trotting
along
them
could
make
a
blind
man
think
a
cavalry
charge
was
coming
everywhere
the
mud
was
black
and
deep
and
in
many
places
malarious
pools
of
stagnant
water
were
standing
a
mississippi
inundation
is
the
next
most
wasting
and
desolating
infliction
to
a
fire
we
had
an
enjoyable
time
here
on
this
sunny
sunday
two
full
hours
liberty
ashore
while
the
boat
discharged
freight
in
the
back
streets
but
few
white
people
were
visible
but
there
were
plenty
of
colored
folk
mainly
women
and
girls
and
almost
without
exception
upholstered
in
bright
new
clothes
of
swell
and
elaborate
style
and
cut
a
glaring
and
hilarious
contrast
to
the
mournful
mud
and
the
pensive
puddles
helena
is
the
second
town
in
arkansas
in
point
of
population
which
is
placed
at
five
thousand
the
country
about
it
is
exceptionally
productive
helena

a
good
cotton

forty
to
sixty
thousand

annually
she
has
a
large
lumber

grain
commerce
has

factories
in

she

center
of
a
broad

prosperous
region
her
gross

of

annually
from
all
sources
are
placed
by
the
new
orleans
times
democrat
at
chapter
a
thumb
print
and
what
came
of
it
we
were
approaching
napoleon
arkansas
so
i
began
to
think
about
my
errand
there
time
noonday
and
bright
and
sunny
this
was
bad
not
best
anyway
for
mine
was
not
preferably
a
noonday
kind
of
errand
the
more
i
thought
the
more
that
fact
pushed
itself
upon
me
now
in
one
form
now
in
another
finally
it
took
the
form
of
a
distinct
question
is
it
good
common
sense
to
do
the
errand
in
daytime
when
by
a
little
sacrifice
of
comfort
and
inclination
you
can
have
night
for
it
and
no
inquisitive
eyes
around
this
settled
it
plain
question
and
plain
answer
make
the
shortest
road
out
of
most
perplexities
i
got
my
friends
into
my
stateroom
and
said
i
was
sorry
to
create
annoyance
and
disappointment
but
that
upon
reflection
it
really
seemed
best
that
we
put
our
luggage
ashore
and
stop
over
at
napoleon
their
disapproval
was
prompt
and
loud
their
language
mutinous
their
main
argument
was
one
which
has
always
been
the
first
to
come
to
the
surface
in
such
cases
since
the
beginning
of
time
but
you
decided
and
agreed
to
stick
to
this
boat
etc
as
if
having
determined
to
do
an
unwise
thing
one
is
thereby
bound
to
go
ahead
and
make
two
unwise
things
of
it
by
carrying
out
that
determination
i
tried
various
mollifying
tactics
upon
them
with
reasonably
good
success
under
which
encouragement
i
increased
my
efforts
and
to
show
them
that
i
had
not
created
this
annoying
errand
and
was
in
no
way
to
blame
for
it
i
presently
drifted
into
its
history
substantially
as
follows
toward
the
end
of
last
year
i
spent
a
few
months
in
munich
bavaria
in
november
i
was
living
in
fraulein
dahlweiner's
pension
karlstrasse
but
my
working
quarters
were
a
mile
from
there
in
the
house
of
a
widow
who
supported
herself
by
taking
lodgers
she
and
her
two
young
children
used
to
drop
in
every
morning
and
talk
german
to
me
by
request
one
day
during
a
ramble
about
the
city
i
visited
one
of
the
two
establishments
where
the
government
keeps
and
watches
corpses
until
the
doctors
decide
that
they
are
permanently
dead
and
not
in
a
trance
state
it
was
a
grisly
place
that
spacious
room
there
were
thirty
six
corpses
of
adults
in
sight
stretched
on
their
backs
on
slightly
slanted
boards
in
three
long
rows
all
of
them
with
wax
white
rigid
faces
and
all
of
them
wrapped
in
white
shrouds
along
the
sides
of
the
room
were
deep
alcoves
like
bay
windows
and
in
each
of
these
lay
several
marble
visaged
babes
utterly
hidden
and
buried
under
banks
of
fresh
flowers
all
but
their
faces
and
crossed
hands
around
a
finger
of
each
of
these
fifty
still
forms
both
great
and
small
was
a
ring
and
from
the
ring
a
wire
led
to
the
ceiling
and
thence
to
a
bell
in
a
watch
room
yonder
where
day
and
night
a
watchman
sits
always
alert
and
ready
to
spring
to
the
aid
of
any
of
that
pallid
company
who
waking
out
of
death
shall
make
a
movement
for
any
even
the
slightest
movement
will
twitch
the
wire
and
ring
that
fearful
bell
i
imagined
myself
a
death
sentinel
drowsing
there
alone
far
in
the
dragging
watches
of
some
wailing
gusty
night
and
having
in
a
twinkling
all
my
body
stricken
to
quivering
jelly
by
the
sudden
clamor
of
that
awful
summons
so
i
inquired
about
this
thing
asked
what
resulted
usually
if
the
watchman
died
and
the
restored
corpse
came
and
did
what
it
could
to
make
his
last
moments
easy
but
i
was
rebuked
for
trying
to
feed
an
idle
and
frivolous
curiosity
in
so
solemn
and
so
mournful
a
place
and
went
my
way
with
a
humbled
crest
next
morning
i
was
telling
the
widow
my
adventure
when
she
exclaimed
come
with
me
i
have
a
lodger
who
shall
tell
you
all
you
want
to
know
he
has
been
a
night
watchman
there
he
was
a
living
man
but
he
did
not
look
it
he
was
abed
and
had
his
head
propped
high
on
pillows
his
face
was
wasted
and
colorless
his
deep
sunken
eyes
were
shut
his
hand
lying
on
his
breast
was
talon
like
it
was
so
bony
and
long
fingered
the
widow
began
her
introduction
of
me
the
man's
eyes
opened
slowly
and
glittered
wickedly
out
from
the
twilight
of
their
caverns
he
frowned
a
black
frown
he
lifted
his
lean
hand
and
waved
us
peremptorily
away
but
the
widow
kept
straight
on
till
she
had
got
out
the
fact
that
i
was
a
stranger
and
an
american
the
man's
face
changed
at
once
brightened
became
even
eager
and
the
next
moment
he
and
i
were
alone
together
i
opened
up
in
cast
iron
german
he
responded
in
quite
flexible
english
thereafter
we
gave
the
german
language
a
permanent
rest
this
consumptive
and
i
became
good
friends
i
visited
him
every
day
and
we
talked
about
everything
at
least
about
everything
but
wives
and
children
let
anybody's
wife
or
anybody's
child
be
mentioned
and
three
things
always
followed
the
most
gracious
and
loving
and
tender
light
glimmered
in
the
man's
eyes
for
a
moment
faded
out
the
next
and
in
its
place
came
that
deadly
look
which
had
flamed
there
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
his
lids
unclose
thirdly
he
ceased
from
speech
there
and
then
for
that
day
lay
silent
abstracted
and
absorbed
apparently
heard
nothing
that
i
said
took
no
notice
of
my
good
byes
and
plainly
did
not
know
by
either
sight
or
hearing
when
i
left
the
room
when
i
had
been
this
karl
ritter's
daily
and
sole
intimate
during
two
months
he
one
day
said
abruptly
i
will
tell
you
my
story
a
dying
man
s
confession
then
he
went
on
as
follows
i
have
never
given
up
until
now
but
now
i
have
given
up
i
am
going
to
die
i
made
up
my
mind
last
night
that
it
must
be
and
very
soon
too
you
say
you
are
going
to
revisit
your
river
by
and
bye
when
you
find
opportunity
very
well
that
together
with
a
certain
strange
experience
which
fell
to
my
lot
last
night
determines
me
to
tell
you
my
history
for
you
will
see
napoleon
arkansas
and
for
my
sake
you
will
stop
there
and
do
a
certain
thing
for
me
a
thing
which
you
will
willingly
undertake
after
you
shall
have
heard
my
narrative
let
us
shorten
the
story
wherever
we
can
for
it
will
need
it
being
long
you
already
know
how
i
came
to
go
to
america
and
how
i
came
to
settle
in
that
lonely
region
in
the
south
but
you
do
not
know
that
i
had
a
wife
my
wife
was
young
beautiful
loving
and
oh
so
divinely
good
and
blameless
and
gentle
and
our
little
girl
was
her
mother
in
miniature
it
was
the
happiest
of
happy
households
one
night
it
was
toward
the
close
of
the
war
i
woke
up
out
of
a
sodden
lethargy
and
found
myself
bound
and
gagged
and
the
air
tainted
with
chloroform
i
saw
two
men
in
the
room
and
one
was
saying
to
the
other
in
a
hoarse
whisper
i
told
her
i
would
if
she
made
a
noise
and
as
for
the
child
the
other
man
interrupted
in
a
low
half
crying
voice
you
said
we'd
only
gag
them
and
rob
them
not
hurt
them
or
i
wouldn't
have
come
shut
up
your
whining
had
to
change
the
plan
when
they
waked
up
you
done
all
you
could
to
protect
them
now
let
that
satisfy
you
come
help
rummage
both
men
were
masked
and
wore
coarse
ragged
nigger
clothes
they
had
a
bull's
eye
lantern
and
by
its
light
i
noticed
that
the
gentler
robber
had
no
thumb
on
his
right
hand
they
rummaged
around
my
poor
cabin
for
a
moment
the
head
bandit
then
said
in
his
stage
whisper
it's
a
waste
of
time
he
shall
tell
where
it's
hid
undo
his
gag
and
revive
him
up
the
other
said
all
right
provided
no
clubbing
no
clubbing
it
is
then
provided
he
keeps
still
they
approached
me
just
then
there
was
a
sound
outside
a
sound
of
voices
and
trampling
hoofs
the
robbers
held
their
breath
and
listened
the
sounds
came
slowly
nearer
and
nearer
then
came
a
shout
hello
the
house
show
a
light
we
want
water
the
captain's
voice
by
g
said
the
stage
whispering
ruffian
and
both
robbers
fled
by
the
way
of
the
back
door
shutting
off
their
bull's
eye
as
they
ran
the
strangers
shouted
several
times
more
then
rode
by
there
seemed
to
be
a
dozen
of
the
horses
and
i
heard
nothing
more
i
struggled
but
could
not
free
myself
from
my
bonds
i
tried
to
speak
but
the
gag
was
effective
i
could
not
make
a
sound
i
listened
for
my
wife's
voice
and
my
child's
listened
long
and
intently
but
no
sound
came
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
their
bed
was
this
silence
became
more
and
more
awful
more
and
more
ominous
every
moment
could
you
have
endured
an
hour
of
it
do
you
think
pity
me
then
who
had
to
endure
three
three
hours
it
was
three
ages
whenever
the
clock
struck
it
seemed
as
if
years
had
gone
by
since
i
had
heard
it
last
all
this
time
i
was
struggling
in
my
bonds
and
at
last
about
dawn
i
got
myself
free
and
rose
up
and
stretched
my
stiff
limbs
i
was
able
to
distinguish
details
pretty
well
the
floor
was
littered
with
things
thrown
there
by
the
robbers
during
their
search
for
my
savings
the
first
object
that
caught
my
particular
attention
was
a
document
of
mine
which
i
had
seen
the
rougher
of
the
two
ruffians
glance
at
and
then
cast
away
it
had
blood
on
it
i
staggered
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
oh
poor
unoffending
helpless
ones
there
they
lay
their
troubles
ended
mine
begun
did
i
appeal
to
the
law
i
does
it
quench
the
pauper's
thirst
if
the
king
drink
for
him
oh
no
no
no
i
wanted
no
impertinent
interference
of
the
law
laws
and
the
gallows
could
not
pay
the
debt
that
was
owing
to
me
let
the
laws
leave
the
matter
in
my
hands
and
have
no
fears
i
would
find
the
debtor
and
collect
the
debt
how
accomplish
this
do
you
say
how
accomplish
it
and
feel
so
sure
about
it
when
i
had
neither
seen
the
robbers
faces
nor
heard
their
natural
voices
nor
had
any
idea
who
they
might
be
nevertheless
i
was
sure
quite
sure
quite
confident
i
had
a
clue
a
clue
which
you
would
not
have
valued
a
clue
which
would
not
have
greatly
helped
even
a
detective
since
he
would
lack
the
secret
of
how
to
apply
it
i
shall
come
to
that
presently
you
shall
see
let
us
go
on
now
taking
things
in
their
due
order
there
was
one
circumstance
which
gave
me
a
slant
in
a
definite
direction
to
begin
with
those
two
robbers
were
manifestly
soldiers
in
tramp
disguise
and
not
new
to
military
service
but
old
in
it
regulars
perhaps
they
did
not
acquire
their
soldierly
attitude
gestures
carriage
in
a
day
nor
a
month
nor
yet
in
a
year
so
i
thought
but
said
nothing
and
one
of
them
had
said
the
captain's
voice
by
g
the
one
whose
life
i
would
have
two
miles
away
several
regiments
were
in
camp
and
two
companies
of
u
s
cavalry
when
i
learned
that
captain
blakely
of
company
c
had
passed
our
way
that
night
with
an
escort
i
said
nothing
but
in
that
company
i
resolved
to
seek
my
man
in
conversation
i
studiously
and
persistently
described
the
robbers
as
tramps
camp
followers
and
among
this
class
the
people
made
useless
search
none
suspecting
the
soldiers
but
me
working
patiently
by
night
in
my
desolated
home
i
made
a
disguise
for
myself
out
of
various
odds
and
ends
of
clothing
in
the
nearest
village
i
bought
a
pair
of
blue
goggles
by
and
bye
when
the
military
camp
broke
up
and
company
c
was
ordered
a
hundred
miles
north
to
napoleon
i
secreted
my
small
hoard
of
money
in
my
belt
and
took
my
departure
in
the
night
when
company
c
arrived
in
napoleon
i
was
already
there
yes
i
was
there
with
a
new
trade
fortune
teller
not
to
seem
partial
i
made
friends
and
told
fortunes
among
all
the
companies
garrisoned
there
but
i
gave
company
c
the
great
bulk
of
my
attentions
i
made
myself
limitlessly
obliging
to
these
particular
men
they
could
ask
me
no
favor
put
upon
me
no
risk
which
i
would
decline
i
became
the
willing
butt
of
their
jokes
this
perfected
my
popularity
i
became
a
favorite
i
early
found
a
private
who
lacked
a
thumb
what
joy
it
was
to
me
and
when
i
found
that
he
alone
of
all
the
company
had
lost
a
thumb
my
last
misgiving
vanished
i
was
sure
i
was
on
the
right
track
this
man's
name
was
kruger
a
german
there
were
nine
germans
in
the
company
i
watched
to
see
who
might
be
his
intimates
but
he
seemed
to
have
no
especial
intimates
but
i
was
his
intimate
and
i
took
care
to
make
the
intimacy
grow
sometimes
i
so
hungered
for
my
revenge
that
i
could
hardly
restrain
myself
from
going
on
my
knees
and
begging
him
to
point
out
the
man
who
had
murdered
my
wife
and
child
but
i
managed
to
bridle
my
tongue
i
bided
my
time
and
went
on
telling
fortunes
as
opportunity
offered
my
apparatus
was
simple
a
little
red
paint
and
a
bit
of
white
paper
i
painted
the
ball
of
the
client's
thumb
took
a
print
of
it
on
the
paper
studied
it
that
night
and
revealed
his
fortune
to
him
next
day
what
was
my
idea
in
this
nonsense
it
was
this
when
i
was
a
youth
i
knew
an
old
frenchman
who
had
been
a
prison
keeper
for
thirty
years
and
he
told
me
that
there
was
one
thing
about
a
person
which
never
changed
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
the
lines
in
the
ball
of
the
thumb
and
he
said
that
these
lines
were
never
exactly
alike
in
the
thumbs
of
any
two
human
beings
in
these
days
we
photograph
the
new
criminal
and
hang
his
picture
in
the
rogues
gallery
for
future
reference
but
that
frenchman
in
his
day
used
to
take
a
print
of
the
ball
of
a
new
prisoner's
thumb
and
put
that
away
for
future
reference
he
always
said
that
pictures
were
no
good
future
disguises
could
make
them
useless
the
thumb's
the
only
sure
thing
said
he
you
can't
disguise
that
and
he
used
to
prove
his
theory
too
on
my
friends
and
acquaintances
it
always
succeeded
i
went
on
telling
fortunes
every
night
i
shut
myself
in
all
alone
and
studied
the
day's
thumb
prints
with
a
magnifying
glass
imagine
the
devouring
eagerness
with
which
i
pored
over
those
mazy
red
spirals
with
that
document
by
my
side
which
bore
the
right
hand
thumb
and
finger
marks
of
that
unknown
murderer
printed
with
the
dearest
blood
to
me
that
was
ever
shed
on
this
earth
and
many
and
many
a
time
i
had
to
repeat
the
same
old
disappointed
remark
will
they
never
correspond
but
my
reward
came
at
last
it
was
the
print
of
the
thumb
of
the
forty
third
man
of
company
c
whom
i
had
experimented
on
private
franz
adler
an
hour
before
i
did
not
know
the
murderer's
name
or
voice
or
figure
or
face
or
nationality
but
now
i
knew
all
these
things
i
believed
i
might
feel
sure
the
frenchman's
repeated
demonstrations
being
so
good
a
warranty
still
there
was
a
way
to
make
sure
i
had
an
impression
of
kruger's
left
thumb
in
the
morning
i
took
him
aside
when
he
was
off
duty
and
when
we
were
out
of
sight
and
hearing
of
witnesses
i
said
impressively
a
part
of
your
fortune
is
so
grave
that
i
thought
it
would
be
better
for
you
if
i
did
not
tell
it
in
public
you
and
another
man
whose
fortune
i
was
studying
last
night
private
adler
have
been
murdering
a
woman
and
a
child
you
are
being
dogged
within
five
days
both
of
you
will
be
assassinated
he
dropped
on
his
knees
frightened
out
of
his
wits
and
for
five
minutes
he
kept
pouring
out
the
same
set
of
words
like
a
demented
person
and
in
the
same
half
crying
way
which
was
one
of
my
memories
of
that
murderous
night
in
my
cabin
i
didn't
do
it
upon
my
soul
i
didn't
do
it
and
i
tried
to
keep
him
from
doing
it
i
did
as
god
is
my
witness
he
did
it
alone
this
was
all
i
wanted
and
i
tried
to
get
rid
of
the
fool
but
no
he
clung
to
me
imploring
me
to
save
him
from
the
assassin
he
said
i
have
money
ten
thousand
dollars
hid
away
the
fruit
of
loot
and
thievery
save
me
tell
me
what
to
do
and
you
shall
have
it
every
penny
two
thirds
of
it
is
my
cousin
adler's
but
you
can
take
it
all
we
hid
it
when
we
first
came
here
but
i
hid
it
in
a
new
place
yesterday
and
have
not
told
him
shall
not
tell
him
i
was
going
to
desert
and
get
away
with
it
all
it
is
gold
and
too
heavy
to
carry
when
one
is
running
and
dodging
but
a
woman
who
has
been
gone
over
the
river
two
days
to
prepare
my
way
for
me
is
going
to
follow
me
with
it
and
if
i
got
no
chance
to
describe
the
hiding
place
to
her
i
was
going
to
slip
my
silver
watch
into
her
hand
or
send
it
to
her
and
she
would
understand
there's
a
piece
of
paper
in
the
back
of
the
case
which
tells
it
all
here
take
the
watch
tell
me
what
to
do
he
was
trying
to
press
his
watch
upon
me
and
was
exposing
the
paper
and
explaining
it
to
me
when
adler
appeared
on
the
scene
about
a
dozen
yards
away
i
said
to
poor
kruger
put
up
your
watch
i
don't
want
it
you
shan't
come
to
any
harm
go
now
i
must
tell
adler
his
fortune
presently
i
will
tell
you
how
to
escape
the
assassin
meantime
i
shall
have
to
examine
your
thumbmark
again
say
nothing
to
adler
about
this
thing
say
nothing
to
anybody
he
went
away
filled
with
fright
and
gratitude
poor
devil
i
told
adler
a
long
fortune
purposely
so
long
that
i
could
not
finish
it
promised
to
come
to
him
on
guard
that
night
and
tell
him
the
really
important
part
of
it
the
tragical
part
of
it
i
said
so
must
be
out
of
reach
of
eavesdroppers
they
always
kept
a
picket
watch
outside
the
town
mere
discipline
and
ceremony
no
occasion
for
it
no
enemy
around
toward
midnight
i
set
out
equipped
with
the
countersign
and
picked
my
way
toward
the
lonely
region
where
adler
was
to
keep
his
watch
it
was
so
dark
that
i
stumbled
right
on
a
dim
figure
almost
before
i
could
get
out
a
protecting
word
the
sentinel
hailed
and
i
answered
both
at
the
same
moment
i
added
it's
only
me
the
fortune
teller
then
i
slipped
to
the
poor
devil's
side
and
without
a
word
i
drove
my
dirk
into
his
heart
ya
wohl
laughed
i
it
was
the
tragedy
part
of
his
fortune
indeed
as
he
fell
from
his
horse
he
clutched
at
me
and
my
blue
goggles
remained
in
his
hand
and
away
plunged
the
beast
dragging
him
with
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
i
fled
through
the
woods
and
made
good
my
escape
leaving
the
accusing
goggles
behind
me
in
that
dead
man's
hand
this
was
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
ago
since
then
i
have
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
earth
sometimes
at
work
sometimes
idle
sometimes
with
money
sometimes
with
none
but
always
tired
of
life
and
wishing
it
was
done
for
my
mission
here
was
finished
with
the
act
of
that
night
and
the
only
pleasure
solace
satisfaction
i
had
in
all
those
tedious
years
was
in
the
daily
reflection
i
have
killed
him
four
years
ago
my
health
began
to
fail
i
had
wandered
into
munich
in
my
purposeless
way
being
out
of
money
i
sought
work
and
got
it
did
my
duty
faithfully
about
a
year
and
was
then
given
the
berth
of
night
watchman
yonder
in
that
dead
house
which
you
visited
lately
the
place
suited
my
mood
i
liked
it
i
liked
being
with
the
dead
liked
being
alone
with
them
i
used
to
wander
among
those
rigid
corpses
and
peer
into
their
austere
faces
by
the
hour
the
later
the
time
the
more
impressive
it
was
i
preferred
the
late
time
sometimes
i
turned
the
lights
low
this
gave
perspective
you
see
and
the
imagination
could
play
always
the
dim
receding
ranks
of
the
dead
inspired
one
with
weird
and
fascinating
fancies
two
years
ago
i
had
been
there
a
year
then
i
was
sitting
all
alone
in
the
watch
room
one
gusty
winter's
night
chilled
numb
comfortless
drowsing
gradually
into
unconsciousness
the
sobbing
of
the
wind
and
the
slamming
of
distant
shutters
falling
fainter
and
fainter
upon
my
dulling
ear
each
moment
when
sharp
and
suddenly
that
dead
bell
rang
out
a
blood
curdling
alarum
over
my
head
the
shock
of
it
nearly
paralyzed
me
for
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
heard
it
i
gathered
myself
together
and
flew
to
the
corpse
room
about
midway
down
the
outside
rank
a
shrouded
figure
was
sitting
upright
wagging
its
head
slowly
from
one
side
to
the
other
a
grisly
spectacle
its
side
was
toward
me
i
hurried
to
it
and
peered
into
its
face
heavens
it
was
adler
can
you
divine
what
my
first
thought
was
put
into
words
it
was
this
it
seems
then
you
escaped
me
once
there
will
be
a
different
result
this
time
evidently
this
creature
was
suffering
unimaginable
terrors
think
what
it
must
have
been
to
wake
up
in
the
midst
of
that
voiceless
hush
and
look
out
over
that
grim
congregation
of
the
dead
what
gratitude
shone
in
his
skinny
white
face
when
he
saw
a
living
form
before
him
and
how
the
fervency
of
this
mute
gratitude
was
augmented
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
life
giving
cordials
which
i
carried
in
my
hands
then
imagine
the
horror
which
came
into
this
pinched
face
when
i
put
the
cordials
behind
me
and
said
mockingly
speak
up
franz
adler
call
upon
these
dead
doubtless
they
will
listen
and
have
pity
but
here
there
is
none
else
that
will
he
tried
to
speak
but
that
part
of
the
shroud
which
bound
his
jaws
held
firm
and
would
not
let
him
he
tried
to
lift
imploring
hands
but
they
were
crossed
upon
his
breast
and
tied
i
said
shout
franz
adler
make
the
sleepers
in
the
distant
streets
hear
you
and
bring
help
shout
and
lose
no
time
for
there
is
little
to
lose
what
you
cannot
that
is
a
pity
but
it
is
no
matter
it
does
not
always
bring
help
when
you
and
your
cousin
murdered
a
helpless
woman
and
child
in
a
cabin
in
arkansas
my
wife
it
was
and
my
child
they
shrieked
for
help
you
remember
but
it
did
no
good
you
remember
that
it
did
no
good
is
it
not
so
your
teeth
chatter
then
why
cannot
you
shout
loosen
the
bandages
with
your
hands
then
you
can
ah
i
see
your
hands
are
tied
they
cannot
aid
you
how
strangely
things
repeat
themselves
after
long
years
for
my
hands
were
tied
that
night
you
remember
yes
tied
much
as
yours
are
now
how
odd
that
is
i
could
not
pull
free
it
did
not
occur
to
you
to
untie
me
it
does
not
occur
to
me
to
untie
you
sh
there's
a
late
footstep
it
is
coming
this
way
hark
how
near
it
is
one
can
count
the
footfalls
one
two
three
there
it
is
just
outside
now
is
the
time
shout
man
shout
it
is
the
one
sole
chance
between
you
and
eternity
ah
you
see
you
have
delayed
too
long
it
is
gone
by
there
it
is
dying
out
it
is
gone
think
of
it
reflect
upon
it
you
have
heard
a
human
footstep
for
the
last
time
how
curious
it
must
be
to
listen
to
so
common
a
sound
as
that
and
know
that
one
will
never
hear
the
fellow
to
it
again
oh
my
friend
the
agony
in
that
shrouded
face
was
ecstasy
to
see
i
thought
of
a
new
torture
and
applied
it
assisting
myself
with
a
trifle
of
lying
invention
that
poor
kruger
tried
to
save
my
wife
and
child
and
i
did
him
a
grateful
good
turn
for
it
when
the
time
came
i
persuaded
him
to
rob
you
and
i
and
a
woman
helped
him
to
desert
and
got
him
away
in
safety
a
look
as
of
surprise
and
triumph
shone
out
dimly
through
the
anguish
in
my
victim's
face
i
was
disturbed
disquieted
i
said
what
then
didn't
he
escape
a
negative
shake
of
the
head
no
what
happened
then
the
satisfaction
in
the
shrouded
face
was
still
plainer
the
man
tried
to
mumble
out
some
words
could
not
succeed
tried
to
express
something
with
his
obstructed
hands
failed
paused
a
moment
then
feebly
tilted
his
head
in
a
meaning
way
toward
the
corpse
that
lay
nearest
him
dead
i
asked
failed
to
escape
caught
in
the
act
and
shot
negative
shake
of
the
head
how
then
again
the
man
tried
to
do
something
with
his
hands
i
watched
closely
but
could
not
guess
the
intent
i
bent
over
and
watched
still
more
intently
he
had
twisted
a
thumb
around
and
was
weakly
punching
at
his
breast
with
it
ah
stabbed
do
you
mean
affirmative
nod
accompanied
by
a
spectral
smile
of
such
peculiar
devilishness
that
it
struck
an
awakening
light
through
my
dull
brain
and
i
cried
did
i
stab
him
mistaking
him
for
you
for
that
stroke
was
meant
for
none
but
you
the
affirmative
nod
of
the
re
dying
rascal
was
as
joyous
as
his
failing
strength
was
able
to
put
into
its
expression
o
miserable
miserable
me
to
slaughter
the
pitying
soul
that
stood
a
friend
to
my
darlings
when
they
were
helpless
and
would
have
saved
them
if
he
could
miserable
oh
miserable
miserable
me
i
fancied
i
heard
the
muffled
gurgle
of
a
mocking
laugh
i
took
my
face
out
of
my
hands
and
saw
my
enemy
sinking
back
upon
his
inclined
board
he
was
a
satisfactory
long
time
dying
he
had
a
wonderful
vitality
an
astonishing
constitution
yes
he
was
a
pleasant
long
time
at
it
i
got
a
chair
and
a
newspaper
and
sat
down
by
him
and
read
occasionally
i
took
a
sip
of
brandy
this
was
necessary
on
account
of
the
cold
but
i
did
it
partly
because
i
saw
that
along
at
first
whenever
i
reached
for
the
bottle
he
thought
i
was
going
to
give
him
some
i
read
aloud
mainly
imaginary
accounts
of
people
snatched
from
the
grave's
threshold
and
restored
to
life
and
vigor
by
a
few
spoonsful
of
liquor
and
a
warm
bath
yes
he
had
a
long
hard
death
of
it
three
hours
and
six
minutes
from
the
time
he
rang
his
bell
it
is
believed
that
in
all
these
eighteen
years
that
have
elapsed
since
the
institution
of
the
corpse
watch
no
shrouded
occupant
of
the
bavarian
dead
houses
has
ever
rung
its
bell
well
it
is
a
harmless
belief
let
it
stand
at
that
the
chill
of
that
death
room
had
penetrated
my
bones
it
revived
and
fastened
upon
me
the
disease
which
had
been
afflicting
me
but
which
up
to
that
night
had
been
steadily
disappearing
that
man
murdered
my
wife
and
my
child
and
in
three
days
hence
he
will
have
added
me
to
his
list
no
matter
god
how
delicious
the
memory
of
it
i
caught
him
escaping
from
his
grave
and
thrust
him
back
into
it
after
that
night
i
was
confined
to
my
bed
for
a
week
but
as
soon
as
i
could
get
about
i
went
to
the
dead
house
books
and
got
the
number
of
the
house
which
adler
had
died
in
a
wretched
lodging
house
it
was
it
was
my
idea
that
he
would
naturally
have
gotten
hold
of
kruger's
effects
being
his
cousin
and
i
wanted
to
get
kruger's
watch
if
i
could
but
while
i
was
sick
adler's
things
had
been
sold
and
scattered
all
except
a
few
old
letters
and
some
odds
and
ends
of
no
value
however
through
those
letters
i
traced
out
a
son
of
kruger's
the
only
relative
left
he
is
a
man
of
thirty
now
a
shoemaker
by
trade
and
living
at
no
konigstrasse
mannheim
widower
with
several
small
children
without
explaining
to
him
why
i
have
furnished
two
thirds
of
his
support
ever
since
now
as
to
that
watch
see
how
strangely
things
happen
i
traced
it
around
and
about
germany
for
more
than
a
year
at
considerable
cost
in
money
and
vexation
and
at
last
i
got
it
got
it
and
was
unspeakably
glad
opened
it
and
found
nothing
in
it
why
i
might
have
known
that
that
bit
of
paper
was
not
going
to
stay
there
all
this
time
of
course
i
gave
up
that
ten
thousand
dollars
then
gave
it
up
and
dropped
it
out
of
my
mind
and
most
sorrowfully
for
i
had
wanted
it
for
kruger's
son
last
night
when
i
consented
at
last
that
i
must
die
i
began
to
make
ready
i
proceeded
to
burn
all
useless
papers
and
sure
enough
from
a
batch
of
adler's
not
previously
examined
with
thoroughness
out
dropped
that
long
desired
scrap
i
recognized
it
in
a
moment
here
it
is
i
will
translate
it
brick
livery
stable
stone
foundation
middle
of
town
corner
of
orleans
and
market
corner
toward
court
house
third
stone
fourth
row
stick
notice
there
saying
how
many
are
to
come
there
take
it
and
preserve
it
kruger
explained
that
that
stone
was
removable
and
that
it
was
in
the
north
wall
of
the
foundation
fourth
row
from
the
top
and
third
stone
from
the
west
the
money
is
secreted
behind
it
he
said
the
closing
sentence
was
a
blind
to
mislead
in
case
the
paper
should
fall
into
wrong
hands
it
probably
performed
that
office
for
adler
now
i
want
to
beg
that
when
you
make
your
intended
journey
down
the
river
you
will
hunt
out
that
hidden
money
and
send
it
to
adam
kruger
care
of
the
mannheim
address
which
i
have
mentioned
it
will
make
a
rich
man
of
him
and
i
shall
sleep
the
sounder
in
my
grave
for
knowing
that
i
have
done
what
i
could
for
the
son
of
the
man
who
tried
to
save
my
wife
and
child
albeit
my
hand
ignorantly
struck
him
down
whereas
the
impulse
of
my
heart
would
have
been
to
shield
and
serve
him
chapter
the
disposal
of
a
bonanza
such
was
ritter's
narrative
said
i
to
my
two
friends
there
was
a
profound
and
impressive
silence
which
lasted
a
considerable
time
then
both
men
broke
into
a
fusillade
of
exciting
and
admiring
ejaculations
over
the
strange
incidents
of
the
tale
and
this
along
with
a
rattling
fire
of
questions
was
kept
up
until
all
hands
were
about
out
of
breath
then
my
friends
began
to
cool
down
and
draw
off
under
shelter
of
occasional
volleys
into
silence
and
abysmal
reverie
for
ten
minutes
now
there
was
stillness
then
rogers
said
dreamily
ten
thousand
dollars
adding
after
a
considerable
pause
ten
thousand
it
is
a
heap
of
money
presently
the
poet
inquired
are
you
going
to
send
it
to
him
right
away
yes
i
said
it
is
a
queer
question
no
reply
after
a
little
rogers
asked
hesitatingly
all
of
it
that
is
i
mean
certainly
all
of
it
i
was
going
to
say
more
but
stopped
was
stopped
by
a
train
of
thought
which
started
up
in
me
thompson
spoke
but
my
mind
was
absent
and
i
did
not
catch
what
he
said
but
i
heard
rogers
answer
yes
it
seems
so
to
me
it
ought
to
be
quite
sufficient
for
i
don't
see
that
he
has
done
anything
presently
the
poet
said
when
you
come
to
look
at
it
it
is
more
than
sufficient
just
look
at
it
five
thousand
dollars
why
he
couldn't
spend
it
in
a
lifetime
and
it
would
injure
him
too
perhaps
ruin
him
you
want
to
look
at
that
in
a
little
while
he
would
throw
his
last
away
shut
up
his
shop
maybe
take
to
drinking
maltreat
his
motherless
children
drift
into
other
evil
courses
go
steadily
from
bad
to
worse
yes
that's
it
interrupted
rogers
fervently
i've
seen
it
a
hundred
times
yes
more
than
a
hundred
you
put
money
into
the
hands
of
a
man
like
that
if
you
want
to
destroy
him
that's
all
just
put
money
into
his
hands
it's
all
you've
got
to
do
and
if
it
don't
pull
him
down
and
take
all
the
usefulness
out
of
him
and
all
the
self
respect
and
everything
then
i
don't
know
human
nature
ain't
that
so
thompson
and
even
if
we
were
to
give
him
a
third
of
it
why
in
less
than
six
months
less
than
six
weeks
you'd
better
say
said
i
warming
up
and
breaking
in
unless
he
had
that
three
thousand
dollars
in
safe
hands
where
he
couldn't
touch
it
he
would
no
more
last
you
six
weeks
than
of
course
he
wouldn't
said
thompson
i've
edited
books
for
that
kind
of
people
and
the
moment
they
get
their
hands
on
the
royalty
maybe
it's
three
thousand
maybe
it's
two
thousand
what
business
has
that
shoemaker
with
two
thousand
dollars
i
should
like
to
know
broke
in
rogers
earnestly
a
man
perhaps
perfectly
contented
now
there
in
mannheim
surrounded
by
his
own
class
eating
his
bread
with
the
appetite
which
laborious
industry
alone
can
give
enjoying
his
humble
life
honest
upright
pure
in
heart
and
blest
yes
i
say
blest
blest
above
all
the
myriads
that
go
in
silk
attire
and
walk
the
empty
artificial
round
of
social
folly
but
just
you
put
that
temptation
before
him
once
just
you
lay
fifteen
hundred
dollars
before
a
man
like
that
and
say
fifteen
hundred
devils
cried
i
five
hundred
would
rot
his
principles
paralyze
his
industry
drag
him
to
the
rumshop
thence
to
the
gutter
thence
to
the
almshouse
thence
to
why
put
upon
ourselves
this
crime
gentlemen
interrupted
the
poet
earnestly
and
appealingly
he
is
happy
where
he
is
and
as
he
is
every
sentiment
of
honor
every
sentiment
of
charity
every
sentiment
of
high
and
sacred
benevolence
warns
us
beseeches
us
commands
us
to
leave
him
undisturbed
that
is
real
friendship
that
is
true
friendship
we
could
follow
other
courses
that
would
be
more
showy
but
none
that
would
be
so
truly
kind
and
wise
depend
upon
it
after
some
further
talk
it
became
evident
that
each
of
us
down
in
his
heart
felt
some
misgivings
over
this
settlement
of
the
matter
it
was
manifest
that
we
all
felt
that
we
ought
to
send
the
poor
shoemaker
something
there
was
long
and
thoughtful
discussion
of
this
point
and
we
finally
decided
to
send
him
a
chromo
well
now
that
everything
seemed
to
be
arranged
satisfactorily
to
everybody
concerned
a
new
trouble
broke
out
it
transpired
that
these
two
men
were
expecting
to
share
equally
in
the
money
with
me
that
was
not
my
idea
i
said
that
if
they
got
half
of
it
between
them
they
might
consider
themselves
lucky
rogers
said
who
would
have
had
any
if
it
hadn't
been
for
me
i
flung
out
the
first
hint
but
for
that
it
would
all
have
gone
to
the
shoemaker
thompson
said
that
he
was
thinking
of
the
thing
himself
at
the
very
moment
that
rogers
had
originally
spoken
i
retorted
that
the
idea
would
have
occurred
to
me
plenty
soon
enough
and
without
anybody's
help
i
was
slow
about
thinking
maybe
but
i
was
sure
this
matter
warmed
up
into
a
quarrel
then
into
a
fight
and
each
man
got
pretty
badly
battered
as
soon
as
i
had
got
myself
mended
up
after
a
fashion
i
ascended
to
the
hurricane
deck
in
a
pretty
sour
humor
i
found
captain
mccord
there
and
said
as
pleasantly
as
my
humor
would
permit
i
have
come
to
say
good
bye
captain
i
wish
to
go
ashore
at
napoleon
go
ashore
where
napoleon
the
captain
laughed
but
seeing
that
i
was
not
in
a
jovial
mood
stopped
that
and
said
but
are
you
serious
serious
i
certainly
am
the
captain
glanced
up
at
the
pilot
house
and
said
he
wants
to
get
off
at
napoleon
napoleon
that's
what
he
says
great
caesar's
ghost
uncle
mumford
approached
along
the
deck
the
captain
said
uncle
here's
a
friend
of
yours
wants
to
get
off
at
napoleon
well
by
i
said
come
what
is
all
this
about
can't
a
man
go
ashore
at
napoleon
if
he
wants
to
why
hang
it
don't
you
know
there
isn't
any
napoleon
any
more
hasn't
been
for
years
and
years
the

through
it

it

the

of
a
shanty

along

the

to

country
don't
you
yes
i
do
recognize
it
now
it
is
the
most
wonderful
thing
i
ever
heard
of
by
a
long
shot
the
most
wonderful
and
unexpected
mr
thompson
and
mr
rogers
had
arrived
meantime
with
satchels
and
umbrellas
and
had
silently
listened
to
the
captain's
news
thompson
put
a
half
dollar
in
my
hand
and
said
softly
for
my
share
of
the
chromo
rogers
followed
suit
yes
it
was
an
astonishing
thing
to
see
the
mississippi
rolling
between
unpeopled
shores
and
straight
over

i
used
to
see

and
made
them
a
vanity
and
a
jest
when
the
state
of
arkansas
was
chartered
she
controlled
to
the
center
of
the
river
a
most
unstable
line
the
state
of
mississippi
claimed
to
the
channel
another
shifty
and
unstable
line
no
belonged
to
arkansas
by
and
by
a
cut
off
threw
this
big
island
out
of
arkansas
and
yet
not
within
mississippi
middle
of
the
river
on
one
side
of
it
channel
on
the
other
that
is
as
i
understand
the
problem
whether
i
have
got
the
details
right
or
wrong
this
fact
remains
that
here
is
this
big
and
exceedingly
valuable
island
of
four
thousand
acres
thrust
out
in
the
cold
and
belonging
to
neither
the
one
state
nor
the
other
paying
taxes
to
neither
owing
allegiance
to
neither
one
man
owns
the
whole
island
and
of
right
is
the
man
without
a
country
island
belongs
to
arkansas
the
river
moved
it
over
and
joined
it

established
a

there
without

enriched
himself
upon

where
no

having

thousand

doing
a

trade
of

a

town
there
was
much
talk
on
the
boat
about
the
calhoun
land
company
an
enterprise
which
is
expected
to
work
wholesome
results
colonel
calhoun
a
grandson
of
the
statesman
went
to
boston
and
formed
a
syndicate
which
purchased
a
large
tract
of
land
on
the
river
in
chicot
county
arkansas
some
ten
thousand
acres
for
cotton
growing
the
purpose
is
to
work
on
a
cash
basis
buy
at
first
hands
and
handle
their
own
product
supply
their
negro
laborers
with
provisions
and
necessaries
at
a
trifling
profit
say
or
per
cent
furnish
them
comfortable
quarters
etc
and
encourage
them
to
save
money
and
remain
on
the
place
if
this
proves
a
financial
success
as
seems
quite
certain
they
propose
to
establish
a
banking
house
in
greenville
and
lend
money
at
an
unburdensome
rate
of
interest
per
cent
is
spoken
of
the
trouble
heretofore
has
been
i
am
quoting
remarks
of
planters
and
steamboatmen
that
the
planters
although
owning
the
land
were
without
cash
capital
had
to
hypothecate
both
land
and
crop
to
carry
on
the
business
consequently
the
commission
dealer
who
furnishes
the
money
takes
some
risk
and
demands
big
interest
usually
per
cent
and
half
per
cent
for
negotiating
the
loan
the
planter
has
also
to
buy
his
supplies
through
the
same
dealer
paying
commissions
and
profits
then
when
he
ships
his
crop
the
dealer
adds
his
commissions
insurance
etc
so
taking
it
by
and
large
and
first
and
last
the
dealer's
share
of
that
crop
is
about
per
cent
footnote
what
can
the
state
do
where
the
people
are
under
subjection
to
rates
of
interest
ranging
from
to
per
cent
and
are
also
under
the
necessity
of
purchasing
their
crops
in
advance
even
of
planting
at
these
rates
for
the
privilege
of
purchasing
all
their
supplies
at
per
cent
profit
edward
atkinson
a
cotton
planter's
estimate
of
the
average
margin
of
profit
on
planting
in
his
section
one
man
and
mule
will
raise
ten
acres
of
cotton
giving
ten
bales
cotton
worth
say
cost
of
producing
say
net
profit
or
per
acre
there
is
also
a
profit
now
from
the
cotton
seed
which
formerly
had
little
value
none
where
much
transportation
was
necessary
in
sixteen
hundred
pounds
crude
cotton
four
hundred
are
lint
worth
say
ten
cents
a
pound
and
twelve
hundred
pounds
of
seed
worth
or
per
ton
maybe
in
future
even
the
stems
will
not
be
thrown
away
mr
edward
atkinson
says
that
for
each
bale
of
cotton
there
are
fifteen
hundred
pounds
of
stems
and
that
these
are
very
rich
in
phosphate
of
lime
and
potash
that
when
ground
and
mixed
with
ensilage
or
cotton
seed
meal
which
is
too
rich
for
use
as
fodder
in
large
quantities
the
stem
mixture
makes
a
superior
food
rich
in
all
the
elements
needed
for
the
production
of
milk
meat
and
bone
heretofore
the
stems
have
been
considered
a
nuisance
complaint
is
made
that
the
planter
remains
grouty
toward
the
former
slave
since
the
war
will
have
nothing
but
a
chill
business
relation
with
him
no
sentiment
permitted
to
intrude
will
not
keep
a
store
himself
and
supply
the
negro's
wants
and
thus
protect
the
negro's
pocket
and
make
him
able
and
willing
to
stay
on
the
place
and
an
advantage
to
him
to
do
it
but
lets
that
privilege
to
some
thrifty
israelite
who
encourages
the
thoughtless
negro
and
wife
to
buy
all
sorts
of
things
which
they
could
do
without
buy
on
credit
at
big
prices
month
after
month
credit
based
on
the
negro's
share
of
the
growing
crop
and
at
the
end
of
the
season
the
negro's
share
belongs
to
the
israelite
the
negro
is
in
debt
besides
is
discouraged
dissatisfied
restless
and
both
he
and
the
planter
are
injured
for
he
will
take
steamboat
and
migrate
and
the
planter
must
get
a
stranger
in
his
place
who
does
not
know
him
does
not
care
for
him
will
fatten
the
israelite
a
season
and
follow
his
predecessor
per
steamboat
it
is
hoped
that
the
calhoun
company
will
show
by
its
humane
and
protective
treatment
of
its
laborers
that
its
method
is
the
most
profitable
for
both
planter
and
negro
and
it
is
believed
that
a
general
adoption
of
that
method
will
then
follow
and
where
so
many
are
saying
their
say
shall
not
the
barkeeper
testify
he
is
thoughtful
observant
never
drinks
endeavors
to
earn
his
salary
and
would
earn
it
if
there
were
custom
enough
he
says
the
people
along
here
in
mississippi
and
louisiana
will
send
up
the
river
to
buy
vegetables
rather
than
raise
them
and
they
will
come
aboard
at
the
landings
and
buy
fruits
of
the
barkeeper
thinks
they
don't
know
anything
but
cotton
believes
they
don't
know
how
to
raise
vegetables
and
fruit
at
least
the
most
of
them
says
a
nigger
will
go
to

for
a
watermelon
is
all
i
find
in
the
stenographer's
report
means
halifax
probably
though
that
seems
a
good
way
to
go
for
a
watermelon
barkeeper
buys
watermelons
for
five
cents
up
the
river
brings
them
down
and
sells
them
for
fifty
why
does
he
mix
such
elaborate
and
picturesque
drinks
for
the
nigger
hands
on
the
boat
because
they
won't
have
any
other
they
want
a
big
drink
don't
make
any

what
you
make
it
of
they
want
the

you
give
a

a
plain
gill
of
half
a

brandy
for
five
cents
will
he
touch
it
no
ain't
size
enough
to
it

you
put
up
a

of
all
kinds
of
worthless
rubbish
and
heave
in
some
red

to
make
it
beautiful

why

comments
uncle
mumford
with
feeling
also
with
truth
a
mr
h
furnished
some
minor
details
of
fact
concerning
this
region
which
i
would
have
hesitated
to
believe
if
i
had
not
known
him
to
be
a
steamboat
mate
he
was
a
passenger
of
ours
a
resident
of
arkansas
city
and
bound
to
vicksburg
to
join
his
boat
a
little
sunflower
packet
he
was
an
austere
man
and
had
the
reputation
of
being
singularly
unworldly
for
a
river
man
among
other
things
he
said
that
arkansas
had
been
injured
and
kept
back
by
generations
of
exaggerations
concerning
the
mosquitoes
here
one
may
smile
said
he
and
turn
the
matter
off
as
being
a
small
thing
but
when
you
come
to
look
at
the
effects
produced
in
the
way
of
discouragement
of
immigration
and
diminished
values
of
property
it
was
quite
the
opposite
of
a
small
thing
or
thing
in
any
wise
to
be
coughed
down
or
sneered
at
these
mosquitoes
had
been
persistently
represented
as
being
formidable
and
lawless
whereas
the
truth
is
they
are
feeble
insignificant
in
size
diffident
to
a
fault
sensitive
and
so
on
and
so
on
you
would
have
supposed
he
was
talking
about
his
family
but
if
he
was
soft
on
the
arkansas
mosquitoes
he
was
hard
enough
on
the
mosquitoes
of
lake
providence
to
make
up
for
it
those
lake
providence
colossi
as
he
finely
called
them
he
said
that
two
of
them
could
whip
a
dog
and
that
four
of
them
could
hold
a
man
down
and
except
help
come
they
would
kill
him
butcher
him
as
he
expressed
it
referred
in
a
sort
of
casual
way
and
yet
significant
way
to
the
fact
that
the
life
policy
in
its
simplest
form
is
unknown
in
lake
providence
they
take
out
a
mosquito
policy
besides
he
told
many
remarkable
things
about
those
lawless
insects
among
others
said
he
had
seen
them
try
to
vote
noticing
that
this
statement
seemed
to
be
a
good
deal
of
a
strain
on
us
he
modified
it
a
little
said
he
might
have
been
mistaken
as
to
that
particular
but
knew
he
had
seen
them
around
the
polls
canvassing
there
was
another
passenger
friend
of
h
s
who
backed
up
the
harsh
evidence
against
those
mosquitoes
and
detailed
some
stirring
adventures
which
he
had
had
with
them
the
stories
were
pretty
sizable
merely
pretty
sizable

you

what
these

gentlemen
he
explained
privately
that
it
was
necessary
to
watch

all

that

spread
it
so
that
i
was
actually
not

grim
soldiery
who
shout
rats
to
your
holes
and
laugh
the
cannon
thunder
rages
shells
scream
and
crash
overhead
the
iron
rain
pours
down
one
hour
two
hours
three
possibly
six
then
stops
silence
follows
but
the
streets
are
still
empty
the
silence
continues
by
and
bye
a
head
projects
from
a
cave
here
and
there
and
yonder
and
reconnoitres
cautiously
the
silence
still
continuing
bodies
follow
heads
and
jaded
half
smothered
creatures
group
themselves
about
stretch
their
cramped
limbs
draw
in
deep
draughts
of
the
grateful
fresh
air
gossip
with
the
neighbors
from
the
next
cave
maybe
straggle
off
home
presently
or
take
a
lounge
through
the
town
if
the
stillness
continues
and
will
scurry
to
the
holes
again
by
and
bye
when
the
war
tempest
breaks
forth
once
more
there
being
but
three
thousand
of
these
cave
dwellers
merely
the
population
of
a
village
would
they
not
come
to
know
each
other
after
a
week
or
two
and
familiarly
insomuch
that
the
fortunate
or
unfortunate
experiences
of
one
would
be
of
interest
to
all
those
are
the
materials
furnished
by
history
from
them
might
not
almost
anybody
reproduce
for
himself
the
life
of
that
time
in
vicksburg
could
you
who
did
not
experience
it
come
nearer
to
reproducing
it
to
the
imagination
of
another
non
participant
than
could
a
vicksburger
who
did
experience
it
it
seems
impossible
and
yet
there
are
reasons
why
it
might
not
really
be
when
one
makes
his
first
voyage
in
a
ship
it
is
an
experience
which
multitudinously
bristles
with
striking
novelties
novelties
which
are
in
such
sharp
contrast
with
all
this
person's
former
experiences
that
they
take
a
seemingly
deathless
grip
upon
his
imagination
and
memory
by
tongue
or
pen
he
can
make
a
landsman
live
that
strange
and
stirring
voyage
over
with
him
make
him
see
it
all
and
feel
it
all
but
if
he
wait
if
he
make
ten
voyages
in
succession
what
then
why
the
thing
has
lost
color
snap
surprise
and
has
become
commonplace
the
man
would
have
nothing
to
tell
that
would
quicken
a
landsman's
pulse
years
ago
i
talked
with
a
couple
of
the
vicksburg
non
combatants
a
man
and
his
wife
left
to
tell
their
story
in
their
own
way
those
people
told
it
without
fire
almost
without
interest
a
week
of
their
wonderful
life
there
would
have
made
their
tongues
eloquent
for
ever
perhaps
but
they
had
six
weeks
of
it
and
that
wore
the
novelty
all
out
they
got
used
to
being
bomb
shelled
out
of
home
and
into
the
ground
the
matter
became
commonplace
after
that
the
possibility
of
their
ever
being
startlingly
interesting
in
their
talks
about
it
was
gone
what
the
man
said
was
to
this
effect
it
got
to
be
sunday
all
the
time
seven
sundays
in
the
week
to
us
anyway
we
hadn't
anything
to
do
and
time
hung
heavy
seven
sundays
and
all
of
them
broken
up
at
one
time
or
another
in
the
day
or
in
the
night
by
a
few
hours
of
the
awful
storm
of
fire
and
thunder
and
iron
at
first
we
used
to
shin
for
the
holes
a
good
deal
faster
than
we
did
afterwards
the
first
time
i
forgot
the
children
and
maria
fetched
them
both
along
when
she
was
all
safe
in
the
cave
she
fainted
two
or
three
weeks
afterwards
when
she
was
running
for
the
holes
one
morning
through
a
shell
shower
a
big
shell
burst
near
her
and
covered
her
all
over
with
dirt
and
a
piece
of
the
iron
carried
away
her
game
bag
of
false
hair
from
the
back
of
her
head
well
she
stopped
to
get
that
game
bag
before
she
shoved
along
again
was
getting
used
to
things
already
you
see
we
all
got
so
that
we
could
tell
a
good
deal
about
shells
and
after
that
we
didn't
always
go
under
shelter
if
it
was
a
light
shower
us
men
would
loaf
around
and
talk
and
a
man
would
say
there
she
goes
and
name
the
kind
of
shell
it
was
from
the
sound
of
it
and
go
on
talking
if
there
wasn't
any
danger
from
it
if
a
shell
was
bursting
close
over
us
we
stopped
talking
and
stood
still
uncomfortable
yes
but
it
wasn't
safe
to
move
when
it
let
go
we
went
on
talking
again
if
nobody
hurt
maybe
saying
that
was
a
ripper
or
some
such
commonplace
comment
before
we
resumed
or
maybe
we
would
see
a
shell
poising
itself
away
high
in
the
air
overhead
in
that
case
every
fellow
just
whipped
out
a
sudden
see
you
again
gents
and
shoved
often
and
often
i
saw
gangs
of
ladies
promenading
the
streets
looking
as
cheerful
as
you
please
and
keeping
an
eye
canted
up
watching
the
shells
and
i've
seen
them
stop
still
when
they
were
uncertain
about
what
a
shell
was
going
to
do
and
wait
and
make
certain
and
after
that
they
sa'ntered
along
again
or
lit
out
for
shelter
according
to
the
verdict
streets
in
some
towns
have
a
litter
of
pieces
of
paper
and
odds
and
ends
of
one
sort
or
another
lying
around
ours
hadn't
they
had
iron
litter
sometimes
a
man
would
gather
up
all
the
iron
fragments
and
unbursted
shells
in
his
neighborhood
and
pile
them
into
a
kind
of
monument
in
his
front
yard
a
ton
of
it
sometimes
no
glass
left
glass
couldn't
stand
such
a
bombardment
it
was
all
shivered
out
windows
of
the
houses
vacant
looked
like
eye
holes
in
a
skull
whole
panes
were
as
scarce
as
news
we
had
church
sundays
not
many
there
along
at
first
but
by
and
bye
pretty
good
turnouts
i've
seen
service
stop
a
minute
and
everybody
sit
quiet
no
voice
heard
pretty
funeral
like
then
and
all
the
more
so
on
account
of
the
awful
boom
and
crash
going
on
outside
and
overhead
and
pretty
soon
when
a
body
could
be
heard
service
would
go
on
again
organs
and
church
music
mixed
up
with
a
bombardment
is
a
powerful
queer
combination
along
at
first
coming
out
of
church
one
morning
we
had
an
accident
the
only
one
that
happened
around
me
on
a
sunday
i
was
just
having
a
hearty
handshake
with
a
friend
i
hadn't
seen
for
a
while
and
saying
drop
into
our
cave
to
night
after
bombardment
we've
got
hold
of
a
pint
of
prime
wh
whiskey
i
was
going
to
say
you
know
but
a
shell
interrupted
a
chunk
of
it
cut
the
man's
arm
off
and
left
it
dangling
in
my
hand
and
do
you
know
the
thing
that
is
going
to
stick
the
longest
in
my
memory
and
outlast
everything
else
little
and
big
i
reckon
is
the
mean
thought
i
had
then
it
was
the
whiskey
is
saved
and
yet
don't
you
know
it
was
kind
of
excusable
because
it
was
as
scarce
as
diamonds
and
we
had
only
just
that
little
never
had
another
taste
during
the
siege
sometimes
the
caves
were
desperately
crowded
and
always
hot
and
close
sometimes
a
cave
had
twenty
or
twenty
five
people
packed
into
it
no
turning
room
for
anybody
air
so
foul
sometimes
you
couldn't
have
made
a
candle
burn
in
it
a
child
was
born
in
one
of
those
caves
one
night
think
of
that
why
it
was
like
having
it
born
in
a
trunk
twice
we
had
sixteen
people
in
our
cave
and
a
number
of
times
we
had
a
dozen
pretty
suffocating
in
there
we
always
had
eight
eight
belonged
there
hunger
and
misery
and
sickness
and
fright
and
sorrow
and
i
don't
know
what
all
got
so
loaded
into
them
that
none
of
them
were
ever
rightly
their
old
selves
after
the
siege
they
all
died
but
three
of
us
within
a
couple
of
years
one
night
a
shell
burst
in
front
of
the
hole
and
caved
it
in
and
stopped
it
up
it
was
lively
times
for
a
while
digging
out
some
of
us
came
near
smothering
after
that
we
made
two
openings
ought
to
have
thought
of
it
at
first
mule
meat
no
we
only
got
down
to
that
the
last
day
or
two
of
course
it
was
good
anything
is
good
when
you
are
starving
this
man
had
kept
a

during
six
weeks
no
only
the
first

abandoned
life
in
terrific
vicksburg
having
now
become
commonplace
and
matter
of
course
the
war
history
of
vicksburg
has
more
about
it
to
interest
the
general
reader
than
that
of
any
other
of
the
river
towns
it
is
full
of
variety
full
of
incident
full
of
the
picturesque
vicksburg
held
out
longer
than
any
other
important
river
town
and
saw
warfare
in
all
its
phases
both
land
and
water
the
siege
the
mine
the
assault
the
repulse
the
bombardment
sickness
captivity
famine
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
national
cemeteries
is
here
over
the
great
gateway
is
this
inscription
here
rest
in
peace
who
died
for
their
country
in
the
years
to
the
grounds
are
nobly
situated
being
very
high
and
commanding
a
wide
prospect
of
land
and
river
they
are
tastefully
laid
out
in
broad
terraces
with
winding
roads
and
paths
and
there
is
profuse
adornment
in
the
way
of
semi
tropical
shrubs
and
flowers
and
in
one
part
is
a
piece
of
native
wild
wood
left
just
as
it
grew
and
therefore
perfect
in
its
charm
everything
about
this
cemetery
suggests
the
hand
of
the
national
government
the
government's
work
is
always
conspicuous
for
excellence
solidity
thoroughness
neatness
the
government
does
its
work
well
in
the
first
place
and
then
takes
care
of
it
by
winding
roads
which
were
often
cut
to
so
great
a
depth
between
perpendicular
walls
that
they
were
mere
roofless
tunnels
we
drove
out
a
mile
or
two
and
visited
the
monument
which
stands
upon
the
scene
of
the
surrender
of
vicksburg
to
general
grant
by
general
pemberton
its
metal
will
preserve
it
from
the
hackings
and
chippings
which
so
defaced
its
predecessor
which
was
of
marble
but
the
brick
foundations
are
crumbling
and
it
will
tumble
down
by
and
bye
it
overlooks
a
picturesque
region
of
wooded
hills
and
ravines
and
is
not
unpicturesque
itself
being
well
smothered
in
flowering
weeds
the
battered
remnant
of
the
marble
monument
has
been
removed
to
the
national
cemetery
on
the
road
a
quarter
of
a
mile
townward
an
aged
colored
man
showed
us
with
pride
an
unexploded
bomb
shell
which
has
lain
in
his
yard
since
the
day
it
fell
there
during
the
siege
i
was
a
stannin
heah
an
de
dog
was
a
stannin
heah
de
dog
he
went
for
de
shell
gwine
to
pick
a
fuss
wid
it
but
i
didn't
i
says
jes
make
you'seff
at
home
heah
lay
still
whah
you
is
or
bust
up
de
place
jes
as
you's
a
mind
to
but
i's
got
business
out
in
de
woods
i
has
vicksburg
is
a
town
of
substantial
business
streets
and
pleasant
residences
it
commands
the
commerce
of
the
yazoo
and
sunflower
rivers
is
pushing
railways
in
several
directions
through
rich
agricultural
regions
and
has
a
promising
future
of
prosperity
and
importance
apparently
nearly
all
the
river
towns
big
and
little
have
made
up
their
minds
that
they
must
look
mainly
to
railroads
for
wealth
and
upbuilding
henceforth
they
are
acting
upon
this
idea
the
signs
are
that
the
next
twenty
years
will
bring
about
some
noteworthy
changes
in
the
valley
in
the
direction
of
increased
population
and
wealth
and
in
the
intellectual
advancement
and
the
liberalizing
of
opinion
which
go
naturally
with
these
and
yet
if
one
may
judge
by
the
past
the
river
towns
will
manage
to
find
and
use
a
chance
here
and
there
to
cripple
and
retard
their
progress
they
kept
themselves
back
in
the
days
of
steamboating
supremacy
by
a
system
of
wharfage
dues
so
stupidly
graded
as
to
prohibit
what
may
be
called
small
retail
traffic
in
freights
and
passengers
boats
were
charged
such
heavy
wharfage
that
they
could
not
afford
to
land
for
one
or
two
passengers
or
a
light
lot
of
freight
instead
of
encouraging
the
bringing
of
trade
to
their
doors
the
towns
diligently
and
effectively
discouraged
it
they
could
have
had
many
boats
and
low
rates
but
their
policy
rendered
few
boats
and
high
rates
compulsory
it
was
a
policy
which
extended
and
extends
from
new
orleans
to
st
paul
we
had
a
strong
desire
to
make
a
trip
up
the
yazoo
and
the
sunflower
an
interesting
region
at
any
time
but
additionally
interesting
at
this
time
because
up
there
the
great
inundation
was
still
to
be
seen
in
force
but
we
were
nearly
sure
to
have
to
wait
a
day
or
more
for
a
new
orleans
boat
on
our
return
so
we
were
obliged
to
give
up
the
project
here
is
a
story
which
i
picked
up
on
board
the
boat
that
night
i
insert
it
in
this
place
merely
because
it
is
a
good
story
not
because
it
belongs
here
for
it
doesn't
it
was
told
by
a
passenger
a
college
professor
and
was
called
to
the
surface
in
the
course
of
a
general
conversation
which
began
with
talk
about
horses
drifted
into
talk
about
astronomy
then
into
talk
about
the
lynching
of
the
gamblers
in
vicksburg
half
a
century
ago
then
into
talk
about
dreams
and
superstitions
and
ended
after
midnight
in
a
dispute
over
free
trade
and
protection
chapter
the
professor's
yarn
it
was
in
the
early
days
i
was
not
a
college
professor
then
i
was
a
humble
minded
young
land
surveyor
with
the
world
before
me
to
survey
in
case
anybody
wanted
it
done
i
had
a
contract
to
survey
a
route
for
a
great
mining
ditch
in
california
and
i
was
on
my
way
thither
by
sea
a
three
or
four
weeks
voyage
there
were
a
good
many
passengers
but
i
had
very
little
to
say
to
them
reading
and
dreaming
were
my
passions
and
i
avoided
conversation
in
order
to
indulge
these
appetites
there
were
three
professional
gamblers
on
board
rough
repulsive
fellows
i
never
had
any
talk
with
them
yet
i
could
not
help
seeing
them
with
some
frequency
for
they
gambled
in
an
upper
deck
stateroom
every
day
and
night
and
in
my
promenades
i
often
had
glimpses
of
them
through
their
door
which
stood
a
little
ajar
to
let
out
the
surplus
tobacco
smoke
and
profanity
they
were
an
evil
and
hateful
presence
but
i
had
to
put
up
with
it
of
course
there
was
one
other
passenger
who
fell
under
my
eye
a
good
deal
for
he
seemed
determined
to
be
friendly
with
me
and
i
could
not
have
gotten
rid
of
him
without
running
some
chance
of
hurting
his
feelings
and
i
was
far
from
wishing
to
do
that
besides
there
was
something
engaging
in
his
countrified
simplicity
and
his
beaming
good
nature
the
first
time
i
saw
this
mr
john
backus
i
guessed
from
his
clothes
and
his
looks
that
he
was
a
grazier
or
farmer
from
the
backwoods
of
some
western
state
doubtless
ohio
and
afterward
when
he
dropped
into
his
personal
history
and
i
discovered
that
he
was
a
cattle
raiser
from
interior
ohio
i
was
so
pleased
with
my
own
penetration
that
i
warmed
toward
him
for
verifying
my
instinct
he
got
to
dropping
alongside
me
every
day
after
breakfast
to
help
me
make
my
promenade
and
so
in
the
course
of
time
his
easy
working
jaw
had
told
me
everything
about
his
business
his
prospects
his
family
his
relatives
his
politics
in
fact
everything
that
concerned
a
backus
living
or
dead
and
meantime
i
think
he
had
managed
to
get
out
of
me
everything
i
knew
about
my
trade
my
tribe
my
purposes
my
prospects
and
myself
he
was
a
gentle
and
persuasive
genius
and
this
thing
showed
it
for
i
was
not
given
to
talking
about
my
matters
i
said
something
about
triangulation
once
the
stately
word
pleased
his
ear
he
inquired
what
it
meant
i
explained
after
that
he
quietly
and
inoffensively
ignored
my
name
and
always
called
me
triangle
what
an
enthusiast
he
was
in
cattle
at
the
bare
name
of
a
bull
or
a
cow
his
eye
would
light
and
his
eloquent
tongue
would
turn
itself
loose
as
long
as
i
would
walk
and
listen
he
would
walk
and
talk
he
knew
all
breeds
he
loved
all
breeds
he
caressed
them
all
with
his
affectionate
tongue
i
tramped
along
in
voiceless
misery
whilst
the
cattle
question
was
up
when
i
could
endure
it
no
longer
i
used
to
deftly
insert
a
scientific
topic
into
the
conversation
then
my
eye
fired
and
his
faded
my
tongue
fluttered
his
stopped
life
was
a
joy
to
me
and
a
sadness
to
him
one
day
he
said
a
little
hesitatingly
and
with
somewhat
of
diffidence
triangle
would
you
mind
coming
down
to
my
stateroom
a
minute
and
have
a
little
talk
on
a
certain
matter
i
went
with
him
at
once
arrived
there
he
put
his
head
out
glanced
up
and
down
the
saloon
warily
then
closed
the
door
and
locked
it
he
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
he
said
i'm
a
going
to
make
a
little
proposition
to
you
and
if
it
strikes
you
favorable
it'll
be
a
middling
good
thing
for
both
of
us
you
ain't
a
going
out
to
californy
for
fun
nuther
am
i
it's
business
ain't
that
so
well
you
can
do
me
a
good
turn
and
so
can
i
you
if
we
see
fit
i've
raked
and
scraped
and
saved
a
considerable
many
years
and
i've
got
it
all
here
he
unlocked
an
old
hair
trunk
tumbled
a
chaos
of
shabby
clothes
aside
and
drew
a
short
stout
bag
into
view
for
a
moment
then
buried
it
again
and
relocked
the
trunk
dropping
his
voice
to
a
cautious
low
tone
he
continued
she's
all
there
a
round
ten
thousand
dollars
in
yellow
boys
now
this
is
my
little
idea
what
i
don't
know
about
raising
cattle
ain't
worth
knowing
there's
mints
of
money
in
it
in
californy
well
i
know
and
you
know
that
all
along
a
line
that
s
being
surveyed
there
s
little
dabs
of
land
that
they
call
gores
that
fall
to
the
surveyor
free
gratis
for
nothing
all
you've
got
to
do
on
your
side
is
to
survey
in
such
a
way
that
the
gores
will
fall
on
good
fat
land
then
you
turn
em
over
to
me
i
stock
em
with
cattle
in
rolls
the
cash
i
plank
out
your
share
of
the
dollars
regular
right
along
and
i
was
sorry
to
wither
his
blooming
enthusiasm
but
it
could
not
be
helped
i
interrupted
and
said
severely
i
am
not
that
kind
of
a
surveyor
let
us
change
the
subject
mr
backus
it
was
pitiful
to
see
his
confusion
and
hear
his
awkward
and
shamefaced
apologies
i
was
as
much
distressed
as
he
was
especially
as
he
seemed
so
far
from
having
suspected
that
there
was
anything
improper
in
his
proposition
so
i
hastened
to
console
him
and
lead
him
on
to
forget
his
mishap
in
a
conversational
orgy
about
cattle
and
butchery
we
were
lying
at
acapulco
and
as
we
went
on
deck
it
happened
luckily
that
the
crew
were
just
beginning
to
hoist
some
beeves
aboard
in
slings
backus's
melancholy
vanished
instantly
and
with
it
the
memory
of
his
late
mistake
now
only
look
at
that
cried
he
my
goodness
triangle
what
would
they
say
to
it
in
ohio
wouldn't
their
eyes
bug
out
to
see
em
handled
like
that
wouldn't
they
though
all
the
passengers
were
on
deck
to
look
even
the
gamblers
and
backus
knew
them
all
and
had
afflicted
them
all
with
his
pet
topic
as
i
moved
away
i
saw
one
of
the
gamblers
approach
and
accost
him
then
another
of
them
then
the
third
i
halted
waited
watched
the
conversation
continued
between
the
four
men
it
grew
earnest
backus
drew
gradually
away
the
gamblers
followed
and
kept
at
his
elbow
i
was
uncomfortable
however
as
they
passed
me
presently
i
heard
backus
say
with
a
tone
of
persecuted
annoyance
but
it
ain't
any
use
gentlemen
i
tell
you
again
as
i've
told
you
a
half
a
dozen
times
before
i
warn't
raised
to
it
and
i
ain't
a
going
to
resk
it
i
felt
relieved
his
level
head
will
be
his
sufficient
protection
i
said
to
myself
during
the
fortnight's
run
from
acapulco
to
san
francisco
i
several
times
saw
the
gamblers
talking
earnestly
with
backus
and
once
i
threw
out
a
gentle
warning
to
him
he
chuckled
comfortably
and
said
oh
yes
they
tag
around
after
me
considerable
want
me
to
play
a
little
just
for
amusement
they
say
but
laws
a
me
if
my
folks
have
told
me
once
to
look
out
for
that
sort
of
live
stock
they've
told
me
a
thousand
times
i
reckon
by
and
bye
in
due
course
we
were
approaching
san
francisco
it
was
an
ugly
black
night
with
a
strong
wind
blowing
but
there
was
not
much
sea
i
was
on
deck
alone
toward
ten
i
started
below
a
figure
issued
from
the
gamblers
den
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
i
experienced
a
shock
for
i
was
sure
it
was
backus
i
flew
down
the
companion
way
looked
about
for
him
could
not
find
him
then
returned
to
the
deck
just
in
time
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
as
he
re
entered
that
confounded
nest
of
rascality
had
he
yielded
at
last
i
feared
it
what
had
he
gone
below
for
his
bag
of
coin
possibly
i
drew
near
the
door
full
of
bodings
it
was
a
crack
and
i
glanced
in
and
saw
a
sight
that
made
me
bitterly
wish
i
had
given
my
attention
to
saving
my
poor
cattle
friend
instead
of
reading
and
dreaming
my
foolish
time
away
he
was
gambling
worse
still
he
was
being
plied
with
champagne
and
was
already
showing
some
effect
from
it
he
praised
the
cider
as
he
called
it
and
said
now
that
he
had
got
a
taste
of
it
he
almost
believed
he
would
drink
it
if
it
was
spirits
it
was
so
good
and
so
ahead
of
anything
he
had
ever
run
across
before
surreptitious
smiles
at
this
passed
from
one
rascal
to
another
and
they
filled
all
the
glasses
and
whilst
backus
honestly
drained
his
to
the
bottom
they
pretended
to
do
the
same
but
threw
the
wine
over
their
shoulders
i
could
not
bear
the
scene
so
i
wandered
forward
and
tried
to
interest
myself
in
the
sea
and
the
voices
of
the
wind
but
no
my
uneasy
spirit
kept
dragging
me
back
at
quarter
hour
intervals
and
always
i
saw
backus
drinking
his
wine
fairly
and
squarely
and
the
others
throwing
theirs
away
it
was
the
painfullest
night
i
ever
spent
the
only
hope
i
had
was
that
we
might
reach
our
anchorage
with
speed
that
would
break
up
the
game
i
helped
the
ship
along
all
i
could
with
my
prayers
at
last
we
went
booming
through
the
golden
gate
and
my
pulses
leaped
for
joy
i
hurried
back
to
that
door
and
glanced
in
alas
there
was
small
room
for
hope
backus's
eyes
were
heavy
and
bloodshot
his
sweaty
face
was
crimson
his
speech
maudlin
and
thick
his
body
sawed
drunkenly
about
with
the
weaving
motion
of
the
ship
he
drained
another
glass
to
the
dregs
whilst
the
cards
were
being
dealt
he
took
his
hand
glanced
at
it
and
his
dull
eyes
lit
up
for
a
moment
the
gamblers
observed
it
and
showed
their
gratification
by
hardly
perceptible
signs
how
many
cards
none
said
backus
one
villain
named
hank
wiley
discarded
one
card
the
others
three
each
the
betting
began
heretofore
the
bets
had
been
trifling
a
dollar
or
two
but
backus
started
off
with
an
eagle
now
wiley
hesitated
a
moment
then
saw
it
and
went
ten
dollars
better
the
other
two
threw
up
their
hands
backus
went
twenty
better
wiley
said
i
see
that
and
go
you
a
hundred
better
then
smiled
and
reached
for
the
money
let
it
alone
said
backus
with
drunken
gravity
what
you
mean
to
say
you're
going
to
cover
it
cover
it
well
i
reckon
i
am
and
lay
another
hundred
on
top
of
it
too
he
reached
down
inside
his
overcoat
and
produced
the
required
sum
oh
that's
your
little
game
is
it
i
see
your
raise
and
raise
it
five
hundred
said
wiley
five
hundred
better
said
the
foolish
bull
driver
and
pulled
out
the
amount
and
showered
it
on
the
pile
the
three
conspirators
hardly
tried
to
conceal
their
exultation
all
diplomacy
and
pretense
were
dropped
now
and
the
sharp
exclamations
came
thick
and
fast
and
the
yellow
pyramid
grew
higher
and
higher
at
last
ten
thousand
dollars
lay
in
view
wiley
cast
a
bag
of
coin
on
the
table
and
said
with
mocking
gentleness
five
thousand
dollars
better
my
friend
from
the
rural
districts
what
do
you
say
now
i
call
you
said
backus
heaving
his
golden
shot
bag
on
the
pile
what
have
you
got
four
kings
you
d
d
fool
and
wiley
threw
down
his
cards
and
surrounded
the
stakes
with
his
arms
four
aces
you
ass
thundered
backus
covering
his
man
with
a
cocked
revolver
i'm
a
professional
gambler
myself
and
i've
been
laying
for
you
duffers
all
this
voyage
down
went
the
anchor
rumbledy
dum
dum
and
the
long
trip
was
ended
well
well
it
is
a
sad
world
one
of
the
three
gamblers
was
backus's
pal
it
was
he
that
dealt
the
fateful
hands
according
to
an
understanding
with
the
two
victims
he
was
to
have
given
backus
four
queens
but
alas
he
didn't
a
week
later
i
stumbled
upon
backus
arrayed
in
the
height
of
fashion
in
montgomery
street
he
said
cheerily
as
we
were
parting
ah
by
the
way
you
needn't
mind
about
those
gores
i
don't
really
know
anything
about
cattle
except
what
i
was
able
to
pick
up
in
a
week's
apprenticeship
over
in
jersey
just
before
we
sailed
my
cattle
culture
and
cattle
enthusiasm
have
served
their
turn
i
shan't
need
them
any
more
next
day
we
reluctantly
parted
from
the
gold
dust
and
her
officers
hoping
to
see
that
boat
and
all
those
officers
again
some
day
a
thing
which
the
fates
were
to
render
tragically
impossible
chapter
the
end
of
the
gold
dust
for
three
months
later
august
while
i
was
writing
one
of
these
foregoing
chapters
the
new
york
papers
brought
this
telegram
a
terrible
disaster
seventeen
persons
killed
by
an
explosion
on

from

the

exploded
her
boilers
at
three
o'clock
to
day
just
after
leaving
hickman
forty
seven
persons
were
scalded
and
seventeen
are
missing
the
boat
was
landed
in
the
eddy
just
above
the
town
and
through
the
exertions
of
the
citizens
the
cabin
passengers
officers
and
part
of
the
crew
and
deck
passengers
were
taken
ashore
and
removed
to
the
hotels
and
residences
twenty
four
of
the
injured
were
lying
in
holcomb's
dry
goods
store
at
one
time
where
they
received
every
attention
before
being
removed
to
more
comfortable
places
a
list
of
the
names
followed
whereby
it
appeared
that
of
the
seventeen
dead
one
was
the
barkeeper
and
among
the
forty
seven
wounded
were
the
captain
chief
mate
second
mate
and

and

clerks
also
mr
lem
s
gray
pilot
and
several
members
of
the
crew
in
answer
to
a
private
telegram
we
learned
that
none
of
these
was
severely
hurt
except
mr
gray
letters
received
afterward
confirmed
this
news
and
said
that
mr
gray
was
improving
and
would
get
well
later
letters
spoke
less
hopefully
of
his
case
and
finally
came
one
announcing
his
death

good
man

most
companionable
and
manly
man

worthy

a
kindlier
fate
chapter
the
house
beautiful
we
took
passage
in
a
cincinnati
boat
for
new
orleans

on

cincinnati
boat
either
is
correct
the
former
is
the
eastern
form
of
putting
it
the
latter

western
mr
dickens
declined
to
agree
that
the
mississippi
steamboats
were
magnificent
or
that
they
were
floating
palaces
terms
which
had
always
been
applied
to
them
terms
which
did
not
over
express
the
admiration
with
which
the
people
viewed
them
mr
dickens's
position
was
unassailable
possibly
the
people's
position
was
certainly
unassailable
if
mr
dickens
was
comparing
these
boats
with
the
crown
jewels
or
with
the
taj
or
with
the
matterhorn
or
with
some
other
priceless
or
wonderful
thing
which
he
had
seen
they
were
not
magnificent
he
was
right
the
people
compared
them
with
what
they
had
seen
and
thus
measured
thus
judged
the
boats
were
magnificent
the
term
was
the
correct
one
it
was
not
at
all
too
strong
the
people
were
as
right
as
was
mr
dickens
the
steamboats
were
finer
than
anything
on
shore
compared
with
superior
dwelling
houses
and
first
class
hotels
in
the
valley
they
were
indubitably
magnificent
they
were
palaces
to
a
few
people
living
in
new
orleans
and
st
louis
they
were
not
magnificent
perhaps
not
palaces
but
to
the
great
majority
of
those
populations
and
to
the
entire
populations
spread
over
both
banks
between
baton
rouge
and

they
were

they
tallied

what

only

famous
natchez
under
the
hill
has
not
changed
notably
in
twenty
years
in
outward
aspect
judging
by
the
descriptions
of
the
ancient
procession
of
foreign
tourists
it
has
not
changed
in
sixty
for
it
is
still
small
straggling
and
shabby
it
had
a
desperate
reputation
morally
in
the
old
keel
boating
and
early
steamboating
times
plenty
of
drinking
carousing
fisticuffing
and
killing
there
among
the
riff
raff
of
the
river
in
those
days
but
natchez
on
top
of
the
hill
is
attractive
has
always
been
attractive
even
mrs
trollope
had
to
confess
its
charms
at
one
or
two
points
the
wearisome
level
line
is
relieved
by
bluffs
as
they
call
the
short
intervals
of
high
ground
the
town
of
natchez
is
beautifully
situated
on
one
of
those
high
spots
the
contrast
that
its
bright
green
hill
forms
with
the
dismal
line
of
black
forest
that
stretches
on
every
side
the
abundant
growth
of
the
pawpaw
palmetto
and
orange
the
copious
variety
of
sweet
scented
flowers
that
flourish
there
all
make
it
appear
like
an
oasis

natchez
is
the
furthest
point
to

north
at
which
oranges
ripen
in
the
open
air
or
endure
the
winter
without
shelter
with
the
exception
of
this
sweet
spot
i
thought
all
the
little
towns
and
villages
we
passed
wretched
looking
in
the
extreme
natchez
like
her
near
and
far
river
neighbors
has
railways
now
and
is
adding
to
them
pushing
them
hither
and
thither
into
all
rich
outlying
regions
that
are
naturally
tributary
to
her
and
like
vicksburg
and
new
orleans
she
has
her
ice
factory
she
makes
thirty
tons
of
ice
a
day
in
vicksburg
and
natchez
in
my
time
ice
was
jewelry
none
but
the
rich
could
wear
it
but
anybody
and
everybody
can
have
it
now
i
visited
one
of
the
ice
factories
in
new
orleans
to
see
what
the
polar
regions
might
look
like
when
lugged
into
the
edge
of
the
tropics
but
there
was
nothing
striking
in
the
aspect
of
the
place
it
was
merely
a
spacious
house
with
some
innocent
steam
machinery
in
one
end
of
it
and
some
big
porcelain
pipes
running
here
and
there
no
not
porcelain
they
merely
seemed
to
be
they
were
iron
but
the
ammonia
which
was
being
breathed
through
them
had
coated
them
to
the
thickness
of
your
hand
with
solid
milk
white
ice
it
ought
to
have
melted
for
one
did
not
require
winter
clothing
in
that
atmosphere
but
it
did
not
melt
the
inside
of
the
pipe
was
too
cold
sunk
into
the
floor
were
numberless
tin
boxes
a
foot
square
and
two
feet
long
and
open
at
the
top
end
these
were
full
of
clear
water
and
around
each
box
salt
and
other
proper
stuff
was
packed
also
the
ammonia
gases
were
applied
to
the
water
in
some
way
which
will
always
remain
a
secret
to
me
because
i
was
not
able
to
understand
the
process
while
the
water
in
the
boxes
gradually
froze
men
gave
it
a
stir
or
two
with
a
stick
occasionally
to
liberate
the
air
bubbles
i
think
other
men
were
continually
lifting
out
boxes
whose
contents
had
become
hard
frozen
they
gave
the
box
a
single
dip
into
a
vat
of
boiling
water
to
melt
the
block
of
ice
free
from
its
tin
coffin
then
they
shot
the
block
out
upon
a
platform
car
and
it
was
ready
for
market
these
big
blocks
were
hard
solid
and
crystal
clear
in
certain
of
them
big
bouquets
of
fresh
and
brilliant
tropical
flowers
had
been
frozen
in
in
others
beautiful
silken
clad
french
dolls
and
other
pretty
objects
these
blocks
were
to
be
set
on
end
in
a
platter
in
the
center
of
dinner
tables
to
cool
the
tropical
air
and
also
to
be
ornamental
for
the
flowers
and
things
imprisoned
in
them
could
be
seen
as
through
plate
glass
i
was
told
that
this
factory
could
retail
its
ice
by
wagon
throughout
new
orleans
in
the
humblest
dwelling
house
quantities
at
six
or
seven
dollars
a
ton
and
make
a
sufficient
profit
this
being
the
case
there
is
business
for

factories
in
the

for
we

on
no

reminds

upon

i

which
i
overheard
on

the
cincinnati

i
awoke
out
of
a
fretted
sleep
with
a
dull
confusion
of
voices
in

i
listened
two
men
were
talking
subject
apparently
the
great

i
looked
out
through
the

the
two
men
were
eating
a

breakfast
sitting
opposite
each
other
nobody

around
they
closed
up
the
inundation
with
a
few
words
having
used
it
evidently
as
a
mere
ice
breaker
and

breeder
then
they
dropped
into

it

that
they
were

around
it
you
see
butter
don't
stand
any
show
there
ain't
any
chance
for
competition
butter's
had
its
day
and
from
this
out
butter
goes
to
the
wall
there's
more
money
in
oleomargarine
than
why
you
can't
imagine
the
business
we
do
i've
stopped
in
every
town
from
cincinnati
to
natchez
and
i've
sent
home
big
orders
from
every
one
of
them
and
so
forth
and
so
on
for
ten
minutes
longer
in
the
same
fervid
strain
then
new
orleans
piped
up
and
said
yes
it's
a
first
rate
imitation
that's
a
certainty
but
it
ain't
the
only
one
around
that's
first
rate
for
instance
they
make
olive
oil
out
of
cotton
seed
oil
nowadays
so
that
you
can't
tell
them
apart
yes
that's
so
responded
cincinnati
and
it
was
a
tip
top
business
for
a
while
they
sent
it
over
and
brought
it
back
from
france
and
italy
with
the
united
states
custom
house
mark
on
it
to
indorse
it
for
genuine
and
there
was
no
end
of
cash
in
it
but
france
and
italy
broke
up
the
game
of
course
they
naturally
would
cracked
on
such
a
rattling
impost
that
cotton
seed
olive
oil
couldn't
stand
the
raise
had
to
hang
up
and
quit
oh
it
did
did
it
you
wait
here
a
minute
goes
to
his
state
room
brings
back
a
couple
of
long
bottles
and
takes
out
the

says
there
now
smell
them
taste
them
examine
the

inspect
the

you
can't
nobody

people
that
want
to
can
go
to
the
expense
and
trouble
of
shipping
their
oils
to
europe
and
back
it's
their
privilege
but
our
firm
knows
a
trick
worth
six
of
that
we
turn
out
the
whole
thing
clean
from
the
word
go
in
our
factory
in
new
orleans
labels
bottles
oil
everything
well
no
not
labels
been
buying
them
abroad
get
them
dirt
cheap
there
you
see
there's
just
one
little
wee
speck
essence
or
whatever
it
is
in
a
gallon
of
cotton
seed
oil
that
give
it
a
smell
or
a
flavor
or
something
get
that
out
and
you're
all
right
perfectly
easy
then
to
turn
the
oil
into
any
kind
of
oil
you
want
to
and
there
ain't
anybody
that
can
detect
the
true
from
the
false
well
we
know
how
to
get
that
one
little
particle
out
and
we're
the
only
firm
that
does
and
we
turn
out
an
olive
oil
that
is
just
simply
perfect
undetectable
we
are
doing
a
ripping
trade
too
as
i
could
easily
show
you
by
my
order
book
for
this
trip
maybe
you'll
butter
everybody's
bread
pretty
soon
but
we'll
cotton
seed
his
salad
for
him
from
the
gulf
to
canada
and
that's
a
dead
certain
thing
cincinnati

you

that

if

a

of

admiration
of

and
their
grotesque
chivalry

and
romantic

survives
here
in

in

is
already
perceptible
the
wholesome

practical
nineteenth

of

traces
of
its
inflated

is
pathetic
enough
that
a
whitewashed
castle
with
turrets
and
things
materials
all
ungenuine
within
and
without
pretending
to
be
what
they
are
not
should
ever
have
been
built
in
this
otherwise
honorable
place
but
it
is
much
more
pathetic
to
see
this
architectural
falsehood
undergoing
restoration
and
perpetuation
in
our
day
when
it
would
have
been
so
easy
to
let
dynamite
finish

a
charitable
fire
began

devote

from

the
following
remark
is
from
the
same
advertisement
the
institute
building
has
long
been
famed
as
a
model
of
striking
and
beautiful
architecture
visitors
are
charmed
with
its
resemblance
to
the
old
castles
of
song
and
story
with
its
towers
turreted
walls
and
ivy
mantled
porches
keeping
school
in
a
castle
is
a
romantic
thing
as
romantic
as
keeping
hotel
in
a
castle
by
itself
the
imitation
castle
is
doubtless
harmless
and
well
enough
but
as
a
symbol
and
breeder
and
sustainer
of
maudlin
middle
age
romanticism
here
in
the
midst
of
the
plainest
and
sturdiest
and
infinitely
greatest
and
worthiest
of
all
the
centuries
the
world
has
seen
it
is
necessarily
a
hurtful
thing
and
a
mistake
here
is
an
extract
from
the
prospectus
of
a
kentucky
female
college
female
college
sounds
well
enough
but
since
the
phrasing
it
in
that
unjustifiable
way
was
done
purely
in
the
interest
of
brevity
it
seems
to
me
that
she
college
would
have
been
still
better
because
shorter
and
means
the
same
thing
that
is
if
either
phrase
means
anything
at
all
the
president
is
southern
by
birth
by
rearing
by
education
and
by
sentiment
the
teachers
are
all
southern
in
sentiment
and
with
the
exception
of
those
born
in
europe
were
born
and
raised
in
the
south
believing
the
southern
to
be
the
highest
type
of
civilization
this
continent
has
seen
the
young
ladies
are
trained
according
to
the
southern
ideas
of
delicacy
refinement
womanhood
religion
and
propriety
hence
we
offer
a
first
class
female
college
for
the
south
and
solicit
southern
patronage

o'clock
general

a

thomas
o'connor
and

were
killed
in
a
shooting
affray
the
difficulty
began
yesterday
afternoon
by
general
mabry
attacking
major
o'connor
and
threatening
to
kill
him
this
was
at
the
fair
grounds
and
o'connor
told
mabry
that
it
was
not
the
place
to
settle
their
difficulties
mabry
then
told
o'connor
he
should
not
live
it
seems
that
mabry
was
armed
and
o'connor
was
not
the
cause
of
the
difficulty
was
an
old
feud
about
the
transfer
of
some
property
from
mabry
to
o'connor
later
in
the
afternoon
mabry
sent
word
to
o'connor
that
he
would
kill
him
on

this
morning
major
o'connor
was
standing
in
the
door
of
the
mechanics
national
bank
of
which
he
was
president
general
mabry
and
another
gentleman
walked
down
gay
street
on
the
opposite
side
from
the
bank
o'connor
stepped
into
the
bank
got
a
shot
gun
took
deliberate
aim
at
general
mabry
and
fired
mabry
fell
dead
being
shot
in
the
left
side

fell
o'connor
fired
again
the
shot
taking

in

o'connor
then
reached
into
the
bank
and
got
another
shot
gun
about
this
time
joseph
a
mabry
jr
son
of
general
mabry
came
rushing
down
the
street
unseen
by
o'connor
until
within
forty
feet
when
the
young
man
fired
a
pistol
the
shot
taking
effect
in
o'connor's
right
breast
passing
through
the
body
near
the
heart
the
instant
mabry
shot
o'connor
turned
and
fired
the
load
taking
effect
in
young
mabry's
right
breast
and
side
mabry
fell
pierced
with
twenty
buckshot
and
almost
instantly
o'connor
fell
dead
without
a
struggle
mabry
tried
to
rise
but
fell
back
dead
the
whole
tragedy
occurred
within
two
minutes
and
neither
of
the
three
spoke
after
he
was
shot
general
mabry
had
about
thirty
buckshot
in
his
body
a
bystander
was
painfully
wounded
in
the
thigh
with
a
buckshot
and
another
was
wounded
in
the
arm
four
other
men
had
their
clothing
pierced
by
buckshot
the
affair
caused
great
excitement
and
gay
street
was
thronged
with
thousands
of
people
general

one

last

professor
sharpe
of

female
college
a
quiet
and
gentlemanly
man
was
told
that
his
brother
in

a
captain
burton
had
threatened
to
kill
him
burton
it
seems
had
already
killed
one
man
and
driven
his
knife
into
another
the
professor
armed
himself
with
a
double
barreled
shot
gun
started
out
in
search
of
his
brother
in
law
found
him
playing
billiards
in
a
saloon
and
blew
his
brains
out
the
memphis
avalanche
reports
that
the
professor's
course
met
with
pretty
general
approval
in
the
community
knowing
that
the
law
was
powerless
in
the
actual
condition
of
public
sentiment
to
protect
him
he
protected
himself
about
the
same
time
two
young
men
in
north
carolina
quarreled
about
a
girl
and
hostile
messages
were
exchanged
friends
tried
to
reconcile
them
but
had
their
labor
for
their
pains
on
the
the
young
men
met
in
the
public
highway
one
of
them
had
a
heavy
club
in
his
hand
the
other
an
ax
the
man
with
the
club
fought
desperately
for
his
life
but
it
was
a
hopeless
fight
from
the
first
a
well
directed
blow
sent
his
club
whirling
out
of
his
grasp
and
the
next
moment
he
was
a

man
about
the

time

in

peter

threw
pepper
in

roads
demanded
an
apology
dick
refused
to
give
it
and
it
was
agreed
that
a
duel
was
inevitable
but
a
difficulty
arose
the
parties
had
no
pistols
and
it
was
too
late
at
night
to
procure
them
one
of
them
suggested
that
butcher
knives
would
answer
the
purpose
and
the
other
accepted
the
suggestion
the
result
was
that
roads
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
gash
in
his
abdomen
that
may
or
may
not
prove
fatal
if
dick
has
been
arrested
the
news
has
not
reached
us
he
expressed
deep
regret
and
we
are
told
by
a
staunton
correspondent
of

that
every
effort
has
been
made
to
hush
the

one
or
two
of
the

filed
along
here
half
a
century
ago
mrs
trollope
says
the
unbroken
flatness
of
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
continued
unvaried
for
many
miles
above
new
orleans
but
the
graceful
and
luxuriant
palmetto
the
dark
and
noble
ilex
and
the
bright
orange
were
everywhere
to
be
seen
and
it
was

were

the
district
of
country
which
lies
adjacent
to

mississippi
in
the
lower
parts
of
louisiana
is
everywhere
thickly
peopled
by
sugar
planters
whose
showy
houses
gay
piazzas
trig
gardens
and
numerous
slave
villages
all
clean
and
neat
gave
an
exceedingly
thriving
air
to
the
river
scenery
all
the
procession
paint
the
attractive
picture
in
the
same
way
the
descriptions
of
fifty
years
ago
do
not
need
to
have
a
word
changed
in
order
to
exactly
describe
the
same
region
as
it
appears
to
day
except
as
to
the
trigness
of
the
houses
the
whitewash
is
gone
from
the
negro
cabins
now
and
many
possibly
most
of
the
big
mansions
once
so
shining
white
have
worn
out
their
paint
and
have
a
decayed
neglected
look
it
is
the
blight
of
the
war
twenty
one
years
ago
everything
was
trim
and
trig
and
bright
along
the
coast
just
as
it
had
been
in
as
described
by
those
tourists
unfortunate
tourists
people
humbugged
them
with
stupid
and
silly
lies
and
then
laughed
at
them
for
believing
and
printing
the
same
they
told
mrs
trollope
that
the
alligators
or
crocodiles
as
she
calls
them
were
terrible
creatures
and
backed
up
the
statement
with
a
blood
curdling
account
of
how
one
of
these
slandered
reptiles
crept
into
a
squatter
cabin
one
night
and
ate
up
a
woman
and
five
children
the
woman
by
herself
would
have
satisfied
any
ordinarily
impossible
alligator
but
no
these
liars
must
make
him
gorge
the
five
children
besides
one
would
not
imagine
that
jokers
of
this
robust
breed
would
be
sensitive
but
they
were
it
is
difficult
at
this
day
to
understand
and
impossible
to
justify
the
reception
which
the

of

propped
in

on

may
inspect
miles
of

upper
end
of
the
city
looked
as
they
had
always
looked
warehouses
which
had
had
a
kind
of
aladdin's
lamp
experience
however
since
i
had
seen
them
for
when
the
war
broke
out
the
proprietor
went
to
bed
one
night
leaving
them
packed
with
thousands
of
sacks
of
vulgar
salt
worth
a
couple
of
dollars
a
sack
and
got
up
in
the
morning
and
found
his
mountain
of
salt
turned
into
a
mountain
of
gold
so
to
speak
so
suddenly
and
to
so
dizzy
a
height
had
the
war
news
sent
up
the
price
of
the
article
the
vast
reach
of
plank
wharves
remained
unchanged
and
there
were
as
many
ships
as
ever
but
the
long
array
of
steamboats
had
vanished
not
altogether
of
course
but
not
much
of
it
was
left
the
city
itself
had
not
changed
to
the
eye
it
had
greatly
increased
in
spread
and
population
but
the
look
of
the
town
was
not
altered
the
dust
waste
paper
littered
was
still
deep
in
the
streets
the
deep
trough
like
gutters
alongside
the
curbstones
were
still
half
full
of
reposeful
water
with
a
dusty
surface
the
sidewalks
were
still
in
the
sugar
and
bacon
region
encumbered
by
casks
and
barrels
and
hogsheads
the
great
blocks
of
austerely
plain
commercial
houses
were
as
dusty
looking
as
ever
canal
street
was
finer
and
more
attractive
and
stirring
than
formerly
with
its
drifting
crowds
of
people
its
several
processions
of
hurrying
street
cars
and
toward
evening
its
broad
second
story
verandas
crowded
with
gentlemen
and
ladies
clothed
according
to
the
latest
mode
not
that
there
is
any
architecture
in
canal
street
to
speak
in
broad
general
terms
there
is
no
architecture
in
new
orleans
except
in
the
cemeteries
it
seems
a
strange
thing
to
say
of
a
wealthy
far
seeing
and
energetic
city
of
a
quarter
of
a
million
inhabitants
but
it
is
true
there
is
a
huge
granite
u
s
custom
house
costly
enough
genuine
enough
but
as
a
decoration
it
is
inferior
to
a
gasometer
it
looks
like
a
state
prison
but
it
was
built
before
the
war
architecture
in
america
may
be
said
to
have
been
born
since
the
war
new
orleans
i
believe
has
had
the
good
luck
and
in
a
sense
the
bad
luck
to
have
had
no
great
fire
in
late
years
it
must
be
so
if
the
opposite
had
been
the
case
i
think
one
would
be
able
to
tell
the
burnt
district
by
the
radical
improvement
in
its
architecture
over
the
old
forms
one
can
do
this
in
boston
and
chicago
the
burnt
district
of
boston
was
commonplace
before
the
fire
but
now
there
is
no
commercial
district
in
any
city
in
the
world
that
can
surpass
it
or
perhaps
even
rival
it
in
beauty
elegance
and
tastefulness
however
new
orleans
has
begun
just
this
moment
as
one
may
say
when
completed
the
new
cotton
exchange
will
be
a
stately
and
beautiful
building
massive
substantial
full
of
architectural
graces
no
shams
or
false
pretenses
or
uglinesses
about
it
anywhere
to
the
city
it
will
be
worth
many
times
its
cost
for
it
will
breed
its
species
what
has
been
lacking
hitherto
was
a
model
to
build
toward
something
to
educate
eye
and
taste
a
suggester
so
to
speak
the
city
is
well
outfitted
with
progressive
men
thinking
sagacious
long
headed
men
the
contrast
between
the
spirit
of
the
city
and
the
city's
architecture
is
like
the
contrast
between
waking
and
sleep
apparently
there
is
a
boom
in
everything
but
that
one
dead
feature
the
water
in
the
gutters
used
to
be
stagnant
and
slimy
and
a
potent
disease
breeder
but
the
gutters
are
flushed
now
two
or
three
times
a
day
by
powerful
machinery
in
many
of
the
gutters
the
water
never
stands
still
but
has
a
steady
current
other
sanitary
improvements
have
been
made
and
with
such
effect
that
new
orleans
claims
to
be
during
the
long
intervals
between
the
occasional
yellow
fever
assaults
one
of
the
healthiest
cities
in
the
union
there's
plenty
of
ice
now
for
everybody
manufactured
in
the
town
it
is
a
driving
place
commercially
and
has
a
great
river
ocean
and
railway
business
at
the
date
of
our
visit
it
was
the
best
lighted
city
in
the
union
electrically
speaking
the
new
orleans
electric
lights
were
more
numerous
than
those
of
new
york
and
very
much
better
one
had
this
modified
noonday
not
only
in
canal
and
some
neighboring
chief
streets
but
all
along
a
stretch
of
five
miles
of
river
frontage
there
are
good
clubs
in
the
city
now
several
of
them
but
recently
organized
and
inviting
modern
style
pleasure
resorts
at
west
end
and
spanish
fort
the
telephone
is
everywhere
one
of
the
most
notable
advances
is
in
journalism
the
newspapers
as
i
remember
them
were
not
a
striking
feature
now
they
are
money
is
spent
upon
them
with
a
free
hand
they
get
the
news
let
it
cost
what
it
may
the
editorial
work
is
not
hack
grinding
but
literature
as
an
example
of
new
orleans
journalistic
achievement
it
may
be
mentioned
that
the
times
democrat
of
august
contained
a
report
of
the
year's
business
of
the
towns
of
the
mississippi
valley
from
new
orleans
all
the
way
to
st
paul
two
thousand
miles
that
issue
of
the
paper
consisted
of
forty
pages
seven
columns
to
the
page
two
hundred
and
eighty
columns
in
all
fifteen
hundred
words
to
the
column
an
aggregate
of
four
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
words
that
is
to
say
not
much
short
of
three
times
as
many
words
as
there
are
in
this
book
one
may
with
sorrow
contrast
this
with
the
architecture
of
new
orleans
i
have
been
speaking
of
public
architecture
only
the
domestic
article
in
new
orleans
is
reproachless
notwithstanding
it
remains
as
it
always
was
all
the
dwellings
are
of
wood
in
the
american
part
of
the
town
i
mean
and
all
have
a
comfortable
look
those
in
the
wealthy
quarter
are
spacious
painted
snow
white
usually
and
generally
have
wide
verandas
or
double
verandas
supported
by
ornamental
columns
these
mansions
stand
in
the
center
of
large
grounds
and
rise
garlanded
with
roses
out
of
the
midst
of
swelling
masses
of
shining
green
foliage
and
many
colored
blossoms
no
houses
could
well
be
in
better
harmony
with
their
surroundings
or
more
pleasing
to
the
eye
or
more
home
like
and
comfortable
looking
one
even
becomes
reconciled
to
the
cistern
presently
this
is
a
mighty
cask
painted
green
and
sometimes
a
couple
of
stories
high
which
is
propped
against
the
house
corner
on
stilts
there
is
a
mansion
and
brewery
suggestion
about
the
combination
which
seems
very
incongruous
at
first
but
the
people
cannot
have
wells
and
so
they
take
rain
water
neither
can
they
conveniently
have
cellars
or
graves
footnote
israelites
are
buried
in
graves
by
permission
i
take
it
not
requirement
but
none
else
except
the
destitute
who
are
buried
at
public
expense
the
graves
are
but
three
or
four
feet
deep
the
town
being
built
upon
made
ground
so
they
do
without
both
and
few
of
the
living
complain
and
none
of
the
others
chapter
hygiene
and
sentiment
they
bury
their
dead
in
vaults
above
the
ground
these
vaults
have
a
resemblance
to
houses
sometimes
to
temples
are
built
of
marble
generally
are
architecturally
graceful
and
shapely
they
face
the
walks
and
driveways
of
the
cemetery
and
when
one
moves
through
the
midst
of
a
thousand
or
so
of
them
and
sees
their
white
roofs
and
gables
stretching
into
the
distance
on
every
hand
the
phrase
city
of
the
dead
has
all
at
once
a
meaning
to
him
many
of
the
cemeteries
are
beautiful
and
are
kept
in
perfect
order
when
one
goes
from
the
levee
or
the
business
streets
near
it
to
a
cemetery
he
observes
to
himself
that
if
those
people
down
there
would
live
as
neatly
while
they
are
alive
as
they
do
after
they
are
dead
they
would
find
many
advantages
in
it
and
besides
their
quarter
would
be
the
wonder
and
admiration
of
the
business
world
fresh
flowers
in
vases
of
water
are
to
be
seen
at
the
portals
of
many
of
the
vaults
placed
there
by
the
pious
hands
of
bereaved
parents
and
children
husbands
and
wives
and
renewed
daily
a
milder
form
of
sorrow
finds
its
inexpensive
and
lasting
remembrancer
in
the
coarse
and
ugly
but
indestructible
immortelle
which
is
a
wreath
or
cross
or
some
such
emblem
made
of
rosettes
of
black
linen
with
sometimes
a
yellow
rosette
at
the
conjunction
of
the
cross's
bars
kind
of
sorrowful
breast
pin
so
to
say
the
immortelle
requires
no
attention
you
just
hang
it
up
and
there
you
are
just
leave
it
alone
it
will
take
care
of
your
grief
for
you
and
keep
it
in
mind
better
than
you
can
stands
weather
first
rate
and
lasts
like
boiler
iron
on
sunny
days
pretty
little
chameleons
gracefullest
of
legged
reptiles
creep
along
the
marble
fronts
of
the
vaults
and
catch
flies
their
changes
of
color
as
to
variety
are
not
up
to
the
creature's
reputation
they
change
color
when
a
person
comes
along
and
hangs
up
an
immortelle
but
that
is
nothing
any
right
feeling
reptile
would
do
that
i
will
gradually
drop
this
subject
of
graveyards
i
have
been
trying
all
i
could
to
get
down
to
the
sentimental
part
of
it
but
i
cannot
accomplish
it
i
think
there
is
no
genuinely
sentimental
part
to
it
it
is
all
grotesque
ghastly
horrible
graveyards
may
have
been
justifiable
in
the
bygone
ages
when
nobody
knew
that
for
every
dead
body
put
into
the
ground
to
glut
the
earth
and
the
plant
roots
and
the
air
with
disease
germs
five
or
fifty
or
maybe
a
hundred
persons
must
die
before
their
proper
time
but
they
are
hardly
justifiable
now
when
even
the
children
know
that
a
dead
saint
enters
upon
a
century
long
career
of
assassination
the
moment
the
earth
closes
over
his
corpse
it
is
a
grim
sort
of
a
thought
the
relics
of
st
anne
up
in
canada
have
now
after
nineteen
hundred
years
gone
to
curing
the
sick
by
the
dozen
but
it
is
merest
matter
of
course
that
these
same
relics
within
a
generation
after
st
anne's
death
and
burial
made
several
thousand
people
sick
therefore
these
miracle
performances
are
simply
compensation
nothing
more
st
anne
is
somewhat
slow
pay
for
a
saint
it
is
true
but
better
a
debt
paid
after
nineteen
hundred
years
and
outlawed
by
the
statute
of
limitations
than
not
paid
at
all
and
most
of
the
knights
of
the
halo
do
not
pay
at
all
where
you
find
one
that
pays
like
st
anne
you
find
a
hundred
and
fifty
that
take
the
benefit
of
the
statute
and
none
of
them
pay
any
more
than
the
principal
of
what
they
owe
they
pay
none
of
the
interest
either
simple
or
compound
a
saint
can
never
quite
return
the
principal
however
for
his
dead
body
kills
people
whereas
his
relics
heal
only
they
never
restore
the
dead
to
life
that
part
of
the
account
is
always
left
unsettled

only
the

from

putrefaction

also
with
the
specific

would
answer
as
well
as
burial
for
the
ceremonies
connected
with
it
could
be
made
as
costly
and
ostentatious
as
a
hindu
suttee
while
for
the
poor
cremation
would
be
better
than
burial
because
so
cheap

so
cheap

got
to

the

cremation
would
relieve

old
coffins
and
a
hired
hearse
and
now
look
at
the
thing
i've
worked
up
a
business
here
that
would
satisfy
any
man
don't
care
who
he
is
five
years
ago
lodged
in
an
attic
live
in
a
swell
house
now
with
a
mansard
roof
and
all
the
modern
inconveniences
does
a
coffin
pay
so
well
is
there
much
profit
on
a
coffin
go
way
how
you
talk
then
with
a
confidential
wink
a
dropping
of
the
voice
and
an
impressive
laying
of
his
hand
on
my
arm
look
here
there's
one
thing
in
this
world
which
isn't
ever
cheap
that's
a
coffin
there's
one
thing
in
this
world
which
a
person
don't
ever
try
to
jew
you
down
on
that's
a
coffin
there's
one
thing
in
this
world
which
a
person
don't
say
i'll
look
around
a
little
and
if
i
find
i
can't
do
better
i'll
come
back
and
take
it
that's
a
coffin
there's
one
thing
in
this
world
which
a
person
won't
take
in
pine
if
he
can
go
walnut
and
won't
take
in
walnut
if
he
can
go
mahogany
and
won't
take
in
mahogany
if
he
can
go
an
iron
casket
with
silver
door
plate
and
bronze
handles
that's
a
coffin
and
there's
one
thing
in
this
world
which
you
don't
have
to
worry
around
after
a
person
to
get
him
to
pay
for
and
that's
a
coffin
undertaking
why
it's
the
dead
surest
business
in
christendom
and
the
nobbiest
why
just
look
at
it
a
rich
man
won't
have
anything
but
your
very
best
and
you
can
just
pile
it
on
too
pile
it
on
and
sock
it
to
him
he
won't
ever
holler
and
you
take
in
a
poor
man
and
if
you
work
him
right
he'll
bust
himself
on
a
single
lay
out
or
especially
a
woman
f'r
instance
mrs
o'flaherty
comes
in
widow
wiping
her
eyes
and
kind
of
moaning
unhandkerchiefs
one
eye
bats
it
around
tearfully
over
the
stock
says
and
fhat
might
ye
ask
for
that
wan
thirty
nine
dollars
madam
says
i
it
s
a
foine
big
price
sure
but
pat
shall
be
buried
like
a
gintleman
as
he
was
if
i
have
to
work
me
fingers
off
for
it
i'll
have
that
wan
sor
yes
madam
says
i
and
it
is
a
very
good
one
too
not
costly
to
be
sure
but
in
this
life
we
must
cut
our
garment
to
our
clothes
as
the
saying
is
and
as
she
starts
out
i
heave
in
kind
of
casually
this
one
with
the
white
satin
lining
is
a
beauty
but
i
am
afraid
well
sixty
five
dollars
is
a
rather
rather
but
no
matter
i
felt
obliged
to
say
to
mrs
o'shaughnessy
d'ye
mane
to
soy
that
bridget
o'shaughnessy
bought
the
mate
to
that
joo
ul
box
to
ship
that
dhrunken
divil
to
purgatory
in
yes
madam
then
pat
shall
go
to
heaven
in
the
twin
to
it
if
it
takes
the
last
rap
the
o'flaherties
can
raise
and
moind
you
stick
on
some
extras
too
and
i'll
give
ye
another
dollar
and
as
i
lay
in
with
the
livery
stables
of
course
i
don't
forget
to
mention
that
mrs
o'shaughnessy
hired
fifty
four
dollars
worth
of
hacks
and
flung
as
much
style
into
dennis's
funeral
as
if
he
had
been
a
duke
or
an
assassin
and
of
course
she
sails
in
and
goes
the
o'shaughnessy
about
four
hacks
and
an
omnibus
better
that
used
to
be
but
that's
all
played
now
that
is
in
this
particular
town
the
irish
got
to
piling
up
hacks
so
on
their
funerals
that
a
funeral
left
them
ragged
and
hungry
for
two
years
afterward
so
the
priest
pitched
in
and
broke
it
all
up
he
don't
allow
them
to
have
but
two
hacks
now
and
sometimes
only
one
well
said
i
if
you
are
so
light
hearted
and
jolly
in
ordinary
times
what
must
you
be
in
an
epidemic
he
shook
his
head
no
you're
off
there
we
don't
like
to
see
an
epidemic
an
epidemic
don't
pay
well
of
course
i
don't
mean
that
exactly
but
it
don't
pay
in
proportion
to
the
regular
thing
don't
it
occur
to
you
why
no
think
i
can't
imagine
what
is
it
it's
just
two
things
well
what
are
they
one's
embamming
and
what's
the
other
ice
how
is
that
well
in
ordinary
times
a
person
dies
and
we
lay
him
up
in
ice
one
day
two
days
maybe
three
to
wait
for
friends
to
come
takes
a
lot
of
it
melts
fast
we
charge
jewelry
rates
for
that
ice
and
war
prices
for
attendance
well
don't
you
know
when
there's
an
epidemic
they
rush
em
to
the
cemetery
the
minute
the
breath's
out
no
market
for
ice
in
an
epidemic
same
with
embamming
you
take
a
family
that's
able
to
embam
and
you've
got
a
soft
thing
you
can
mention
sixteen
different
ways
to
do
it
though
there
ain't
only
one
or
two
ways
when
you
come
down
to
the
bottom
facts
of
it
and
they'll
take
the
highest
priced
way
every
time
it's
human
nature
human
nature
in
grief
it
don't
reason
you
see
time
being
it
don't
care
a
dam
all
it
wants
is
physical
immortality
for
deceased
and
they're
willing
to
pay
for
it
all
you've
got
to
do
is
to
just
be
ca'm
and
stack
it
up
they'll
stand
the
racket
why
man
you
can
take
a
defunct
that
you
couldn't
give
away
and
get
your
embamming
traps
around
you
and
go
to
work
and
in
a
couple
of
hours
he
is
worth
a
cool
six
hundred
that's
what
he's
worth
there
ain't
anything
equal
to
it
but
trading
rats
for
di'monds
in
time
of
famine
well
don't
you
see
when
there's
an
epidemic
people
don't
wait
to
embam
no
indeed
they
don't
and
it
hurts
the
business
like
hell
th
as
we
say
hurts
it
like
hell
th
health
see
our
little
joke
in
the
trade
well
i
must
be
going
give
me
a
call
whenever
you
need
any
i
mean
when
you're
going
by
sometime
in
his
joyful
high
spirits
he
did
the
exaggerating
himself
if
any
has
been
done
i
have
not
enlarged
on
him
with
the
above
brief
references
to
inhumation
let
us
leave
the
subject
as
for
me
i
hope
to
be
cremated
i
made
that
remark
to
my
pastor
once
who
said
with
what
he
seemed
to
think
was
an
impressive
manner
i
wouldn't
worry
about
that
if
i
had
your
chances

the
old
french
part
of
new
orleans
anciently
the
spanish
part
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
american
end
of
the
city
the
american
end
which
lies
beyond
the
intervening
brick
business
center
the
houses
are
massed
in
blocks
are
austerely
plain
and
dignified
uniform
of
pattern
with
here
and
there
a
departure
from
it
with
pleasant
effect
all
are
plastered
on
the
outside
and
nearly
all
have
long
iron
railed
verandas
running
along
the
several
stories
their
chief
beauty
is
the
deep
warm
varicolored
stain
with
which
time
and
the
weather
have
enriched
the
plaster
it
harmonizes
with
all
the
surroundings
and
has
as
natural
a
look
of
belonging
there
as
has
the
flush
upon
sunset
clouds
this
charming
decoration
cannot
be
successfully
imitated
neither
is
it
to
be
found
elsewhere
in
america
the
iron
railings
are
a
specialty
also
the
pattern
is
often
exceedingly
light
and
dainty
and
airy
and
graceful
with
a
large
cipher
or
monogram
in
the
center
a
delicate
cobweb
of
baffling
intricate
forms
wrought
in

the
ancient

are

are

comparatively
rare
and
proportionately
valuable

the
party
had
the
privilege
of
idling
through
this
ancient
quarter
of
new
orleans
with
the
south's
finest
literary
genius
the
author
of
the
grandissimes
in
him
the
south
has
found
a
masterly
delineator
of
its
interior
life
and
its
history
in
truth
i
find
by
experience
that
the
untrained
eye
and
vacant
mind
can
inspect
it
and
learn
of
it
and
judge
of
it
more
clearly
and
profitably
in
his
books
than
by
personal
contact
with
it
with
mr
cable
along
to
see
for
you
and
describe
and
explain
and
illuminate
a
jog
through
that
old
quarter
is
a
vivid
pleasure
and
you
have
a
vivid
sense
as
of
unseen
or
dimly
seen
things
vivid
and
yet
fitful
and
darkling
you
glimpse
salient
features
but
lose
the
fine
shades
or
catch
them
imperfectly
through
the
vision
of
the
imagination
a
case
as
it
were
of
ignorant
near
sighted
stranger
traversing
the
rim
of
wide
vague
horizons
of
alps
with
an
inspired
and
enlightened
long
sighted
native
we
visited
the
old
st
louis
hotel
now
occupied
by
municipal
offices
there
is
nothing
strikingly
remarkable
about
it
but
one
can
say
of
it
as
of
the
academy
of
music
in
new
york
that
if
a
broom
or
a
shovel
has
ever
been
used
in
it
there
is
no
circumstantial
evidence
to
back
up
the
fact
it
is
curious
that
cabbages
and
hay
and
things
do
not
grow
in
the
academy
of
music
but
no
doubt
it
is
on
account
of
the
interruption
of
the
light
by
the
benches
and
the
impossibility
of
hoeing
the
crop
except
in
the
aisles
the
fact
that
the
ushers
grow
their
buttonhole
bouquets
on
the
premises
shows
what
might
be
done
if
they
had
the
right
kind
of
an
agricultural
head
to
the
establishment
we
visited
also
the
venerable
cathedral
and
the
pretty
square
in
front
of
it
the
one
dim
with
religious
light
the
other
brilliant
with
the
worldly
sort
and
lovely
with
orange
trees
and
blossomy
shrubs
then
we
drove
in
the
hot
sun
through
the
wilderness
of
houses
and
out
on
to
the
wide
dead
level
beyond
where
the
villas
are
and
the
water
wheels
to
drain
the
town
and
the
commons
populous
with
cows
and
children
passing
by
an
old
cemetery
where
we
were
told
lie
the
ashes
of
an
early
pirate
but
we
took
him
on
trust
and
did
not
visit
him
he
was
a
pirate
with
a
tremendous
and
sanguinary
history
and
as
long
as
he
preserved
unspotted
in
retirement
the
dignity
of
his
name
and
the
grandeur
of
his
ancient
calling
homage
and
reverence
were
his
from
high
and
low
but
when
at
last
he
descended
into
politics
and
became
a
paltry
alderman
the
public
shook
him
and
turned
aside
and
wept
when
he
died
they
set
up
a
monument
over
him
and
little
by
little
he
has
come
into
respect
again
but
it
is
respect
for
the
pirate
not
the
alderman
to
day
the
loyal
and
generous
remember
only
what
he
was
and
charitably
forget
what
he
became
thence
we
drove
a
few
miles
across
a
swamp
along
a
raised
shell
road
with
a
canal
on
one
hand
and
a
dense
wood
on
the
other
and
here
and
there
in
the
distance
a
ragged
and
angular
limbed
and
moss
bearded
cypress
top
standing
out
clear
cut
against
the
sky
and
as
quaint
of
form
as
the
apple
trees
in
japanese
pictures
such
was
our
course
and
the
surroundings
of
it
there
was
an
occasional
alligator
swimming
comfortably
along
in
the
canal
and
an
occasional
picturesque
colored
person
on
the
bank
flinging
his
statue
rigid
reflection
upon
the
still
water
and
watching
for
a
bite
and
by
and
bye
we
reached
the
west
end
a
collection
of
hotels
of
the
usual
light
summer
resort
pattern
with
broad
verandas
all
around
and
the
waves
of
the
wide
and
blue
lake
pontchartrain
lapping
the
thresholds
we
had
dinner
on
a
ground
veranda
over
the
water
the
chief
dish
the
renowned
fish
called
the
pompano
delicious
as
the
less
criminal
forms
of
sin
thousands
of
people
come
by
rail
and
carriage
to
west
end
and
to
spanish
fort
every
evening
and
dine
listen
to
the
bands
take
strolls
in
the
open
air
under
the
electric
lights
go
sailing
on
the
lake
and
entertain
themselves
in
various
and
sundry
other
ways
we
had
opportunities
on
other
days
and
in
other
places
to
test
the
pompano
notably
at
an
editorial
dinner
at
one
of
the
clubs
in
the
city
he
was
in
his
last
possible
perfection
there
and
justified
his
fame
in
his
suite
was
a
tall
pyramid
of
scarlet
cray
fish
large
ones
as
large
as
one's
thumb
delicate
palatable
appetizing
also
deviled
whitebait
also
shrimps
of
choice
quality
and
a
platter
of
small
soft
shell
crabs
of
a
most
superior
breed
the
other
dishes
were
what
one
might
get
at
delmonico's
or
buckingham
palace
those
i
have
spoken
of
can
be
had
in
similar
perfection
in
new
orleans
only
i
suppose
in
the
west
and
south
they
have
a
new
institution
the
broom
brigade
it
is
composed
of
young
ladies
who
dress
in
a
uniform
costume
and
go
through
the
infantry
drill
with
broom
in
place
of
musket
it
is
a
very
pretty
sight
on
private
view
when
they
perform
on
the
stage
of
a
theater
in
the
blaze
of
colored
fires
it
must
be
a
fine
and
fascinating
spectacle
i
saw
them
go
through
their
complex
manual
with
grace
spirit
and
admirable
precision
i
saw
them
do
everything
which
a
human
being
can
possibly
do
with
a
broom
except
sweep
i
did
not
see
them
sweep
but
i
know
they
could
learn
what
they
have
already
learned
proves
that
and
if
they
ever
should
learn
and
should
go
on
the
war
path
down
tchoupitoulas
or
some
of
those
other
streets
around
there
those
thoroughfares
would
bear
a
greatly
improved
aspect
in
a
very
few
minutes
but
the
girls
themselves
wouldn't
so
nothing
would
be
really
gained
after
all
the
drill
was
in
the
washington
artillery
building
in
this
building
we
saw
many
interesting
relics
of
the
war
also
a
fine
oil
painting
representing
stonewall
jackson's
last
interview
with
general
lee
both
men
are
on
horseback
jackson
has
just
ridden
up
and
is
accosting
lee
the
picture
is
very
valuable
on
account
of
the
portraits
which
are
authentic
but
like
many
another
historical
picture
it
means
nothing
without
its
label
and
one
label
will
fit
it
as
well
as
another
first
interview
between
lee
and
jackson
last
interview
between
lee
and
jackson
jackson
introducing
himself
to
lee
jackson
accepting
lee's
invitation
to
dinner
jackson
declining
lee's
invitation
to
dinner
with
thanks
jackson
apologizing
for
a
heavy
defeat
jackson
reporting
a
great
victory
jackson
asking
lee
for
a
match
it
tells
one
story
and
a
sufficient
one
for
it
says
quite
plainly
and
satisfactorily
here
are
lee
and
jackson
together
the
artist
would
have
made
it
tell
that
this
is
lee
and
jackson's
last
interview
if
he
could
have
done
it
but
he
couldn't
for
there
wasn't
any
way
to
do
it
a
good
legible
label
is
usually
worth
for
information
a
ton
of
significant
attitude
and
expression
in
a
historical
picture
in
rome
people
with
fine
sympathetic
natures
stand
up
and
weep
in
front
of
the
celebrated
beatrice
cenci
the
day
before
her
execution
it
shows
what
a
label
can
do
if
they
did
not
know
the
picture
they
would
inspect
it
unmoved
and
say
young
girl
with
hay
fever
young
girl
with
her
head
in
a
bag
i
found
the
half
forgotten
southern
intonations
and
elisions
as
pleasing
to
my
ear
as
they
had
formerly
been
a
southerner
talks
music
at
least
it
is
music
to
me
but
then
i
was
born
in
the
south
the
educated
southerner
has
no
use
for
an
r
except
at
the
beginning
of
a
word
he
says
honah
and
dinnah
and
gove'nuh
and
befo
the
waw
and
so
on
the
words
may
lack
charm
to
the
eye
in
print
but
they
have
it
to
the
ear
when
did
the
r
disappear
from
southern
speech
and
how
did
it
come
to
disappear
the
custom
of
dropping
it
was
not
borrowed
from
the
north
nor
inherited
from
england
many
southerners
most
southerners
put
a
y
into
occasional
words
that
begin
with
the
k
sound
for
instance
they
say
mr
k'yahtah
carter
and
speak
of
playing
k'yahds
or
of
riding
in
the
k'yahs
and
they
have
the
pleasant
custom
long
ago
fallen
into
decay
in
the
north
of
frequently
employing
the
respectful
sir
instead
of
the
curt
yes
and
the
abrupt
no
they
say
yes
suh
no
suh
but
there
are
some
infelicities
such
as
like
for
as
and
the
addition
of
an
at
where
it
isn't
needed
i
heard
an
educated
gentleman
say
like
the
flag
officer
did
his
cook
or
his
butler
would
have
said
like
the
flag
officer
done
you
hear
gentlemen
say
where
have
you
been
at
and
here
is
the
aggravated
form
heard
a
ragged
street
arab
say
it
to
a
comrade
i
was
a
ask'n
tom
whah
you
was
a
sett'n
at
the
very
elect
carelessly
say
will
when
they
mean
shall
and
many
of
them
say
i
didn't
go
to
do
it
meaning
i
didn't
mean
to
do
it
the
northern
word
guess
imported
from
england
where
it
used
to
be
common
and
now
regarded
by
satirical
englishmen
as
a
yankee
original
is
but
little
used
among
southerners
they
say
reckon
they
haven't
any
doesn't
in
their
language
they
say
don't
instead
the
unpolished
often
use
went
for
gone
it
is
nearly
as
bad
as
the
northern
hadn't
ought
this
reminds
me
that
a
remark
of
a
very
peculiar
nature
was
made
here
in
my
neighborhood
in
the
north
a
few
days
ago
he
hadn't
ought
to
have
went
how
is
that
isn't
that
a
good
deal
of
a
triumph
one
knows
the
orders
combined
in
this
half
breed's
architecture
without
inquiring
one
parent
northern
the
other
southern
to
day
i
heard
a
schoolmistress
ask
where
is
john
gone
this
form
is
so
common
so
nearly
universal
in
fact
that
if
she
had
used
whither
instead
of
where
i
think
it
would
have
sounded
like
an
affectation
we
picked
up
one
excellent
word
a
word
worth
traveling
to
new
orleans
to
get
a
nice
limber
expressive
handy
word
lagniappe
they
pronounce
it
lanny
yap
it
is
spanish
so
they
said
we
discovered
it
at
the
head
of
a
column
of
odds
and
ends
in
the
picayune
the
first
day
heard
twenty
people
use
it
the
second
inquired
what
it
meant
the
third
adopted
it
and
got
facility
in
swinging
it
the
fourth
it
has
a
restricted
meaning
but
i
think
the
people
spread
it
out
a
little
when
they
choose
it
is
the
equivalent
of
the
thirteenth
roll
in
a
baker's
dozen
it
is
something
thrown
in
gratis
for
good
measure
the
custom
originated
in
the
spanish
quarter
of
the
city
when
a
child
or
a
servant
buys
something
in
a
shop
or
even
the
mayor
or
the
governor
for
aught
i
know
he
finishes
the
operation
by
saying
give
me
something
for
lagniappe
the
shopman
always
responds
gives
the
child
a
bit
of
licorice
root
gives
the
servant
a
cheap
cigar
or
a
spool
of
thread
gives
the
governor
i
don't
know
what
he
gives
the
governor
support
likely
when
you
are
invited
to
drink
and
this
does
occur
now
and
then
in
new
orleans
and
you
say
what
again
no
i've
had
enough
the
other
party
says
but
just
this
one
time
more
this
is
for
lagniappe
when
the
beau
perceives
that
he
is
stacking
his
compliments
a
trifle
too
high
and
sees
by
the
young
lady's
countenance
that
the
edifice
would
have
been
better
with
the
top
compliment
left
off
he
puts
his
i
beg
pardon
no
harm
intended
into
the
briefer
form
of
oh
that's
for
lagniappe
if
the
waiter
in
the
restaurant
stumbles
and
spills
a
gill
of
coffee
down
the
back
of
your
neck
he
says
for
lagniappe
sah
and
gets
you
another
cup
without
extra
charge
chapter
southern
sports
in
the
north
one
hears
the
war
mentioned
in
social
conversation
once
a
month
sometimes
as
often
as
once
a
week
but
as
a
distinct
subject
for
talk
it
has
long
ago
been
relieved
of
duty
there
are
sufficient
reasons
for
this
given
a
dinner
company
of
six
gentlemen
to
day
it
can
easily
happen
that
four
of
them
and
possibly
five
were
not
in
the
field
at
all
so
the
chances
are
four
to
two
or
five
to
one
that
the
war
will
at
no
time
during
the
evening
become
the
topic
of
conversation
and
the
chances
are
still
greater
that
if
it
become
the
topic
it
will
remain
so
but
a
little
while
if
you
add
six
ladies
to
the
company
you
have
added
six
people
who
saw
so
little
of
the
dread
realities
of
the
war
that
they
ran
out
of
talk
concerning
them
years
ago
and
now
would
soon
weary
of
the
war
topic
if
you
brought
it
up
the
case
is
very
different
in
the
south
there
every
man
you
meet
was
in
the
war
and
every
lady
you
meet
saw
the
war
the
war
is
the
great
chief
topic
of
conversation
the
interest
in
it
is
vivid
and
constant
the
interest
in
other
topics
is
fleeting
mention
of
the
war
will
wake
up
a
dull
company
and
set
their
tongues
going
when
nearly
any
other
topic
would
fail
in
the
south
the
war
is
what
a
d
is
elsewhere
they
date
from
it
all
day
long
you
hear
things
placed
as
having
happened
since
the
waw
or
du'in
the
waw
or
befo
the
waw
or
right
aftah
the
waw
or
bout
two
yeahs
or
five
yeahs
or
ten
yeahs
befo
the
waw
or
aftah
the
waw
it
shows
how
intimately
every
individual
was
visited
in
his
own
person
by
that
tremendous
episode
it
gives
the
inexperienced
stranger
a
better
idea
of
what
a
vast
and
comprehensive
calamity
invasion
is
than
he
can
ever
get
by
reading
books
at
the
fireside
at
a
club
one
evening
a
gentleman
turned
to
me
and
said
in
an
aside
you
notice
of
course
that
we
are
nearly
always
talking
about
the
war
it
isn't
because
we
haven't
anything
else
to
talk
about
but
because
nothing
else
has
so
strong
an
interest
for
us
and
there
is
another
reason
in
the
war
each
of
us
in
his
own
person
seems
to
have
sampled
all
the
different
varieties
of
human
experience
as
a
consequence
you
can't
mention
an
outside
matter
of
any
sort
but
it
will
certainly
remind
some
listener
of
something
that
happened
during
the
war
and
out
he
comes
with
it
of
course
that
brings
the
talk
back
to
the
war
you
may
try
all
you
want
to
to
keep
other
subjects
before
the
house
and
we
may
all
join
in
and
help
but
there
can
be
but
one
result
the
most
random
topic
would
load
every
man
up
with
war
reminiscences
and
shut
him
up
too
and
talk
would
be
likely
to
stop
presently
because
you
can't
talk
pale
inconsequentialities
when
you've
got
a
crimson
fact
or
fancy
in
your
head
that
you
are
burning
to
fetch
out
the
poet
was
sitting
some
little
distance
away
and
presently
he
began
to
speak
about
the
moon
the
gentleman
who
had
been
talking
to
me
remarked
in
an
aside
there
the
moon
is
far
enough
from
the
seat
of
war
but
you
will
see
that
it
will
suggest
something
to
somebody
about
the
war
in
ten
minutes
from
now
the
moon
as
a
topic
will
be
shelved
the
poet
was
saying
he
had
noticed
something
which
was
a
surprise
to
him
had
had
the
impression
that
down
here
toward
the
equator
the
moonlight
was
much
stronger
and
brighter
than
up
north
had
had
the
impression
that
when
he
visited
new
orleans
many
years
ago
the
moon
interruption
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
let
me
explain
that
reminds
me
of
an
anecdote
everything
is
changed
since
the
war
for
better
or
for
worse
but
you'll
find
people
down
here
born
grumblers
who
see
no
change
except
the
change
for
the
worse
there
was
an
old
negro
woman
of
this
sort
a
young
new
yorker
said
in
her
presence
what
a
wonderful
moon
you
have
down
here
she
sighed
and
said
ah
bless
yo
heart
honey
you
ought
to
seen
dat
moon
befo
de
waw
the
new
topic
was
dead
already
but
the
poet
resurrected
it
and
gave
it
a
new
start
a
brief
dispute
followed
as
to
whether
the
difference
between
northern
and
southern
moonlight
really
existed
or
was
only
imagined
moonlight
talk
drifted
easily
into
talk
about
artificial
methods
of
dispelling
darkness
then
somebody
remembered
that
when
farragut
advanced
upon
port
hudson
on
a
dark
night
and
did
not
wish
to
assist
the
aim
of
the
confederate
gunners
he
carried
no
battle
lanterns
but
painted
the
decks
of
his
ships
white
and
thus
created
a
dim
but
valuable
light
which
enabled
his
own
men
to
grope
their
way
around
with
considerable
facility
at
this
point
the
war
got
the
floor
again
the
ten
minutes
not
quite
up
yet
i
was
not
sorry
for
war
talk
by
men
who
have
been
in
a
war
is
always
interesting
whereas
moon
talk
by
a
poet
who
has
not
been
in
the
moon
is
likely
to
be
dull
we
went
to
a
cockpit
in
new
orleans
on
a
saturday
afternoon
i
had
never
seen
a
cock
fight
before
there
were
men
and
boys
there
of
all
ages
and
all
colors
and
of
many
languages
and
nationalities
but
i
noticed
one
quite
conspicuous
and
surprising
absence
the
traditional
brutal
faces
there
were
no
brutal
faces
with
no
cock
fighting
going
on
you
could
have
played
the
gathering
on
a
stranger
for
a
prayer
meeting
and
after
it
began
for
a
revival
provided
you
blindfolded
your
stranger
for
the
shouting
was
something
prodigious
a
negro
and
a
white
man
were
in
the
ring
everybody
else
outside
the
cocks
were
brought
in
in
sacks
and
when
time
was
called
they
were
taken
out
by
the
two
bottle
holders
stroked
caressed
poked
toward
each
other
and
finally
liberated
the
big
black
cock
plunged
instantly
at
the
little
gray
one
and
struck
him
on
the
head
with
his
spur
the
gray
responded
with
spirit
then
the
babel
of
many
tongued
shoutings
broke
out
and
ceased
not
thenceforth
when
the
cocks
had
been
fighting
some
little
time
i
was
expecting
them
momently
to
drop
dead
for
both
were
blind
red
with
blood
and
so
exhausted
that
they
frequently
fell
down
yet
they
would
not
give
up
neither
would
they
die
the
negro
and
the
white
man
would
pick
them
up
every
few
seconds
wipe
them
off
blow
cold
water
on
them
in
a
fine
spray
and
take
their
heads
in
their
mouths
and
hold
them
there
a
moment
to
warm
back
the
perishing
life
perhaps
i
do
not
know
then
being
set
down
again
the
dying
creatures
would
totter
gropingly
about
with
dragging
wings
find
each
other
strike
a
guesswork
blow
or
two
and
fall
exhausted
once
more
i
did
not
see
the
end
of
the
battle
i
forced
myself
to
endure
it
as
long
as
i
could
but
it
was
too
pitiful
a
sight
so
i
made
frank
confession
to
that
effect
and
we
retired
we
heard
afterward
that
the
black
cock
died
in
the
ring
and
fighting
to
the
last
evidently
there
is
abundant
fascination
about
this
sport
for
such
as
have
had
a
degree
of
familiarity
with
it
i
never
saw
people
enjoy
anything
more
than
this
gathering
enjoyed
this
fight
the
case
was
the
same
with
old
gray
heads
and
with
boys
of
ten
they
lost
themselves
in
frenzies
of
delight
the
cocking
main
is
an
inhuman
sort
of
entertainment
there
is
no
question
about
that
still
it
seems
a
much
more
respectable
and
far
less
cruel
sport
than
fox
hunting
for
the
cocks
like
it
they
experience
as
well
as
confer
enjoyment
which
is
not
the
fox's
case
we
assisted
in
the
french
sense
at
a
mule
race
one
day
i
believe
i
enjoyed
this
contest
more
than
any
other
mule
there
i
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
remember
having
enjoyed
any
other
animal
race
i
ever
saw
the
grand
stand
was
well
filled
with
the
beauty
and
the
chivalry
of
new
orleans
that
phrase
is
not
original
with
me
it
is
the
southern
reporter's
he
has
used
it
for
two
generations
he
uses
it
twenty
times
a
day
or
twenty
thousand
times
a
day
or
a
million
times
a
day
according
to
the
exigencies
he
is
obliged
to
use
it
a
million
times
a
day
if
he
have
occasion
to
speak
of
respectable
men
and
women
that
often
for
he
has
no
other
phrase
for
such
service
except
that
single
one
he
never
tires
of
it
it
always
has
a
fine
sound
to
him
there
is
a
kind
of
swell
medieval
bulliness
and
tinsel
about
it
that
pleases
his
gaudy
barbaric
soul
if
he
had
been
in
palestine
in
the
early
times
we
should
have
had
no
references
to
much
people
out
of
him
no
he
would
have
said
the
beauty
and
the
chivalry
of
galilee
assembled
to
hear
the
sermon
on
the
mount
it
is
likely
that
the
men
and
women
of
the
south
are
sick
enough
of
that
phrase
by
this
time
and
would
like
a
change
but
there
is
no
immediate
prospect
of
their
getting
it
the
new
orleans
editor
has
a
strong
compact
direct
unflowery
style
wastes
no
words
and
does
not
gush
not
so
with
his
average
correspondent
in
the
appendix
i
have
quoted
a
good
letter
penned
by
a
trained
hand
but
the
average
correspondent
hurls
a
style
which
differs
from
that
for
instance
the
times
democrat
sent
a
relief
steamer
up
one
of
the
bayous
last
april
this
steamer
landed
at
a
village
up
there
somewhere
and
the
captain
invited
some
of
the
ladies
of
the
village
to
make
a
short
trip
with
him
they
accepted
and
came
aboard
and
the
steamboat
shoved
out
up
the
creek
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
and
that
is
all
that
the
editor
of
the
times
democrat
would
have
got
out
of
it
there
was
nothing
in
the
thing
but
statistics
and
he
would
have
got
nothing
else
out
of
it
he
would
probably
have
even
tabulated
them
partly
to
secure
perfect
clearness
of
statement
and
partly
to
save
space
but
his
special
correspondent
knows
other
methods
of
handling
statistics
he
just
throws
off
all
restraint
and
wallows
in
them
on
saturday
early
in
the
morning
the
beauty
of
the
place
graced
our
cabin
and
proud
of
her
fair
freight
the
gallant
little
boat
glided
up
the
bayou
twenty
two
words
to
say
the
ladies
came
aboard
and
the
boat
shoved
out
up
the
creek
is
a
clean
waste
of
ten
good
words
and
is
also
destructive
of
compactness
of
statement
the
trouble
with
the
southern
reporter
is
women
they
unsettle
him
they
throw
him
off
his
balance
he
is
plain
and
sensible
and
satisfactory
until
a
woman
heaves
in
sight
then
he
goes
all
to
pieces
his
mind
totters
he
becomes
flowery
and
idiotic
from
reading
the
above
extract
you
would
imagine
that
this
student
of
sir
walter
scott
is
an
apprentice
and
knows
next
to
nothing
about
handling
a
pen
on
the
contrary
he
furnishes
plenty
of
proofs
in
his
long
letter
that
he
knows
well
enough
how
to
handle
it
when
the
women
are
not
around
to
give
him
the
artificial
flower
complaint
for
instance
at
o'clock
ominous
clouds
began
to
gather
in
the
south
east
and
presently
from
the
gulf
there
came
a
blow
which
increased
in
severity
every
moment
it
was
not
safe
to
leave
the
landing
then
and
there
was
a
delay
the
oaks
shook
off
long
tresses
of
their
mossy
beards
to
the
tugging
of
the
wind
and
the
bayou
in
its
ambition
put
on
miniature
waves
in
mocking
of
much
larger
bodies
of
water
a
lull
permitted
a
start
and
homewards
we
steamed
an
inky
sky
overhead
and
a
heavy
wind
blowing
as
darkness
crept
on
there
were
few
on
board
who
did
not
wish
themselves
nearer
home
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
that
it
is
good
description
compactly
put
yet
there
was
great
temptation
there
to
drop
into
lurid
writing
but
let
us
return
to
the
mule
since
i
left
him
i
have
rummaged
around
and
found
a
full
report
of
the
race
in
it
i
find
confirmation
of
the
theory
which
i
broached
just
now
namely
that
the
trouble
with
the
southern
reporter
is
women
women
supplemented
by
walter
scott
and
his
knights
and
beauty
and
chivalry
and
so
on
this
is
an
excellent
report
as
long
as
the
women
stay
out
of
it
but
when
they
intrude
we
have
this
frantic
result
it
will
be
probably
a
long
time
before
the
ladies
stand
presents
such
a
sea
of
foam
like
loveliness
as
it
did
yesterday
the
new
orleans
women
are
always
charming
but
never
so
much
so
as
at
this
time
of
the
year
when
in
their
dainty
spring
costumes
they
bring
with
them
a
breath
of
balmy
freshness
and
an
odor
of
sanctity
unspeakable
the
stand
was
so
crowded
with
them
that
walking
at
their
feet
and
seeing
no
possibility
of
approach
many
a
man
appreciated
as
he
never
did
before
the
peri's
feeling
at
the
gates
of
paradise
and
wondered
what
was
the
priceless
boon
that
would
admit
him
to
their
sacred
presence
sparkling
on
their
white
robed
breasts
or
shoulders
were
the
colors
of
their
favorite
knights
and
were
it
not
for
the
fact
that
the
doughty
heroes
appeared
on
unromantic
mules
it
would
have
been
easy
to
imagine
one
of
king
arthur's
gala
days
there
were
thirteen
mules
in
the
first
heat
all
sorts
of
mules
they
were
all
sorts
of
complexions
gaits
dispositions
aspects
some
were
handsome
creatures
some
were
not
some
were
sleek
some
hadn't
had
their
fur
brushed
lately
some
were
innocently
gay
and
frisky
some
were
full
of
malice
and
all
unrighteousness
guessing
from
looks
some
of
them
thought
the
matter
on
hand
was
war
some
thought
it
was
a
lark
the
rest
took
it
for
a
religious
occasion
and
each
mule
acted
according
to
his
convictions
the
result
was
an
absence
of
harmony
well
compensated
by
a
conspicuous
presence
of
variety
variety
of
a
picturesque
and
entertaining
sort
all
the
riders
were
young
gentlemen
in
fashionable
society
if
the
reader
has
been
wondering
why
it
is
that
the
ladies
of
new
orleans
attend
so
humble
an
orgy
as
a
mule
race
the
thing
is
explained
now
it
is
a
fashion
freak
all
connected
with
it
are
people
of
fashion
it
is
great
fun
and
cordially
liked
the
mule
race
is
one
of
the
marked
occasions
of
the
year
it
has
brought
some
pretty
fast
mules
to
the
front
one
of
these
had
to
be
ruled
out
because
he
was
so
fast
that
he
turned
the
thing
into
a
one
mule
contest
and
robbed
it
of
one
of
its
best
features
variety
but
every
now
and
then
somebody
disguises
him
with
a
new
name
and
a
new
complexion
and
rings
him
in
again
the
riders
dress
in
full
jockey
costumes
of
bright
colored
silks
satins
and
velvets
the
thirteen
mules
got
away
in
a
body
after
a
couple
of
false
starts
and
scampered
off
with
prodigious
spirit
as
each
mule
and
each
rider
had
a
distinct
opinion
of
his
own
as
to
how
the
race
ought
to
be
run
and
which
side
of
the
track
was
best
in
certain
circumstances
and
how
often
the
track
ought
to
be
crossed
and
when
a
collision
ought
to
be
accomplished
and
when
it
ought
to
be
avoided
these
twenty
six
conflicting
opinions
created
a
most
fantastic
and
picturesque
confusion
and
the
resulting
spectacle
was
killingly
comical
mile
heat
time
eight
of
the
thirteen
mules
distanced
i
had
a
bet
on
a
mule
which
would
have
won
if
the
procession
had
been
reversed
the
second
heat
was
good
fun
and
so
was
the
consolation
race
for
beaten
mules
which
followed
later
but
the
first
heat
was
the
best
in
that
respect
i
think
that
much
the
most
enjoyable
of
all
races
is
a
steamboat
race
but
next
to
that
i
prefer
the
gay
and
joyous
mule
rush
two
red
hot
steamboats
raging
along
neck
and
neck
straining
every
nerve
that
is
to
say
every
rivet
in
the
boilers
quaking
and
shaking
and
groaning
from
stem
to
stern
spouting
white
steam
from
the
pipes
pouring
black
smoke
from
the
chimneys
raining
down
sparks
parting
the
river
into
long
breaks
of
hissing
foam
this
is
sport
that
makes
a
body's
very
liver
curl
with
enjoyment
a
horse
race
is
pretty
tame
and
colorless
in
comparison
still
a
horse
race
might
be
well
enough
in
its
way
perhaps
if
it
were
not
for
the
tiresome
false
starts
but
then
nobody
is
ever
killed
at
least
nobody
was
ever
killed
when
i
was
at
a
horse
race
they
have
been
crippled
it
is
true
but
this
is
little
to
the
purpose
chapter
enchantments
and
enchanters
the
largest
annual
event
in
new
orleans
is
a
something
which
we
arrived
too
late
to
sample
the
mardi
gras
festivities
i
saw
the
procession
of
the
mystic
crew
of
comus
there
twenty
four
years
ago
with
knights
and
nobles
and
so
on
clothed
in
silken
and
golden
paris
made
gorgeousnesses
planned
and
bought
for
that
single
night's
use
and
in
their
train
all
manner
of
giants
dwarfs
monstrosities
and
other
diverting
grotesquerie
a
startling
and
wonderful
sort
of
show
as
it
filed
solemnly
and
silently
down
the
street
in
the
light
of
its
smoking
and
flickering
torches
but
it
is
said
that
in
these
latter
days
the
spectacle
is
mightily
augmented
as
to
cost
splendor
and
variety
there
is
a
chief
personage
rex
and
if
i
remember
rightly
neither
this
king
nor
any
of
his
great
following
of
subordinates
is
known
to
any
outsider
all
these
people
are
gentlemen
of
position
and
consequence
and
it
is
a
proud
thing
to
belong
to
the
organization
so
the
mystery
in
which
they
hide
their
personality
is
merely
for
romance's
sake
and
not
on
account
of
the
police
mardi
gras
is
of
course
a
relic
of
the
french
and
spanish
occupation
but
i
judge
that
the
religious
feature
has
been
pretty
well
knocked
out
of
it
now
sir
walter
has
got
the
advantage
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
cowl
and
rosary
and
he
will
stay
his
medieval
business
supplemented
by
the
monsters
and
the
oddities
and
the
pleasant
creatures
from
fairy
land
is
finer
to
look
at
than
the
poor
fantastic
inventions
and
performances
of
the
reveling
rabble
of
the
priest's
day
and
serves
quite
as
well
perhaps
to
emphasize
the
day
and
admonish
men
that
the
grace
line
between
the
worldly
season
and
the
holy
one
is
reached
this
mardi
gras
pageant
was
the
exclusive
possession
of
new
orleans
until
recently
but
now
it
has
spread
to
memphis
and
st
louis
and
baltimore
it
has
probably
reached
its
limit
it
is
a
thing
which
could
hardly
exist
in
the
practical
north
would
certainly
last
but
a
very
brief
time
as
brief
a
time
as
it
would
last
in
london
for
the
soul
of
it
is
the
romantic
not
the
funny
and
the
grotesque
take
away
the
romantic
mysteries
the
kings
and
knights
and
big
sounding
titles
and
mardi
gras
would
die
down
there
in
the
south
the
very
feature
that
keeps
it
alive
in
the
south
girly
girly
romance
would
kill
it
in
the
north
or
in
london
puck
and
punch
and
the
press
universal
would
fall
upon
it
and
make
merciless
fun
of
it
and
its
first
exhibition
would
be
also
its
last
against
the
crimes
of
the
french
revolution
and
of
bonaparte
may
be
set
two
compensating
benefactions
the
revolution
broke
the
chains
of
the
ancien
regime
and
of
the
church
and
made
of
a
nation
of
abject
slaves
a
nation
of
freemen
and
bonaparte
instituted
the
setting
of
merit
above
birth
and
also
so
completely
stripped
the
divinity
from
royalty
that
whereas
crowned
heads
in
europe
were
gods
before
they
are
only
men
since
and
can
never
be
gods
again
but
only
figureheads
and
answerable
for
their
acts
like
common
clay
such
benefactions
as
these
compensate
the
temporary
harm
which
bonaparte
and
the
revolution
did
and
leave
the
world
in
debt
to
them
for
these
great
and
permanent
services
to
liberty
humanity
and
progress
then
comes
sir
walter
scott
with
his
enchantments
and
by
his
single
might
checks
this
wave
of
progress
and
even
turns
it
back
sets
the
world
in
love
with
dreams
and
phantoms
with
decayed
and
swinish
forms
of
religion
with
decayed
and
degraded
systems
of
government
with
the
sillinesses
and
emptinesses
sham
grandeurs
sham
gauds
and
sham
chivalries
of
a
brainless
and
worthless
long
vanished
society
he
did
measureless
harm
more
real
and
lasting
harm
perhaps
than
any
other
individual
that
ever
wrote
most
of
the
world
has
now
outlived
good
part
of
these
harms
though
by
no
means
all
of
them
but
in
our
south
they
flourish
pretty
forcefully
still
not
so
forcefully
as
half
a
generation
ago
perhaps
but
still
forcefully
there
the
genuine
and
wholesome
civilization
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
curiously
confused
and
commingled
with
the
walter
scott
middle
age
sham
civilization
and
so
you
have
practical
common
sense
progressive
ideas
and
progressive
works
mixed
up
with
the
duel
the
inflated
speech
and
the
jejune
romanticism
of
an
absurd
past
that
is
dead
and
out
of
charity
ought
to
be
buried
but
for
the
sir
walter
disease
the
character
of
the
southerner
or
southron
according
to
sir
walter's
starchier
way
of
phrasing
it
would
be
wholly
modern
in
place
of
modern
and
medieval
mixed
and
the
south
would
be
fully
a
generation
further
advanced
than
it
is
it
was
sir
walter
that
made
every
gentleman
in
the
south
a
major
or
a
colonel
or
a
general
or
a
judge
before
the
war
and
it
was
he
also
that
made
these
gentlemen
value
these
bogus
decorations
for
it
was
he
that
created
rank
and
caste
down
there
and
also
reverence
for
rank
and
caste
and
pride
and
pleasure
in
them
enough
is
laid
on
slavery
without
fathering
upon
it
these
creations
and
contributions
of
sir
walter
sir
walter
had
so
large
a
hand
in
making
southern
character
as
it
existed
before
the
war
that
he
is
in
great
measure
responsible
for
the
war
it
seems
a
little
harsh
toward
a
dead
man
to
say
that
we
never
should
have
had
any
war
but
for
sir
walter
and
yet
something
of
a
plausible
argument
might
perhaps
be
made
in
support
of
that
wild
proposition
the
southerner
of
the
american
revolution
owned
slaves
so
did
the
southerner
of
the
civil
war
but
the
former
resembles
the
latter
as
an
englishman
resembles
a
frenchman
the
change
of
character
can
be
traced
rather
more
easily
to
sir
walter's
influence
than
to
that
of
any
other
thing
or
person
one
may
observe
by
one
or
two
signs
how
deeply
that
influence
penetrated
and
how
strongly
it
holds
if
one
take
up
a
northern
or
southern
literary
periodical
of
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
he
will
find
it
filled
with
wordy
windy
flowery
eloquence
romanticism
sentimentality
all
imitated
from
sir
walter
and
sufficiently
badly
done
too
innocent
travesties
of
his
style
and
methods
in
fact
this
sort
of
literature
being
the
fashion
in
both
sections
of
the
country
there
was
opportunity
for
the
fairest
competition
and
as
a
consequence
the
south
was
able
to
show
as
many
well
known
literary
names
proportioned
to
population
as
the
north
could
but
a
change
has
come
and
there
is
no
opportunity
now
for
a
fair
competition
between
north
and
south
for
the
north
has
thrown
out
that
old
inflated
style
whereas
the
southern
writer
still
clings
to
it
clings
to
it
and
has
a
restricted
market
for
his
wares
as
a
consequence
there
is
as
much
literary
talent
in
the
south
now
as
ever
there
was
of
course
but
its
work
can
gain
but
slight
currency
under
present
conditions
the
authors
write
for
the
past
not
the
present
they
use
obsolete
forms
and
a
dead
language
but
when
a
southerner
of
genius
writes
modern
english
his
book
goes
upon
crutches
no
longer
but
upon
wings
and
they
carry
it
swiftly
all
about
america
and
england
and
through
the
great
english
reprint
publishing
houses
of
germany
as
witness
the
experience
of
mr
cable
and
uncle
remus
two
of
the
very
few
southern
authors
who
do
not
write
in
the
southern
style
instead
of
three
or
four
widely
known
literary
names
the
south
ought
to
have
a
dozen
or
two
and
will
have
them
when
sir
walter's
time
is
out
a
curious
exemplification
of
the
power
of
a
single
book
for
good
or
harm
is
shown
in
the
effects
wrought
by
don
quixote
and
those
wrought
by
ivanhoe
the
first
swept
the
world's
admiration
for
the
medieval
chivalry
silliness
out
of
existence
and
the
other
restored
it
as
far
as
our
south
is
concerned
the
good
work
done
by
cervantes
is
pretty
nearly
a
dead
letter
so
effectually
has
scott's
pernicious
work
undermined
it
chapter
uncle
remus
and
mr
cable
mr
joel
chandler
harris
remus
was
to
arrive
from
atlanta
at
seven
o'clock
sunday
morning
so
we
got
up
and
received
him
we
were
able
to
detect
him
among
the
crowd
of
arrivals
at
the
hotel
counter
by
his
correspondence
with
a
description
of
him
which
had
been
furnished
us
from
a
trustworthy
source
he
was
said
to
be
undersized
red
haired
and
somewhat
freckled
he
was
the
only
man
in
the
party
whose
outside
tallied
with
this
bill
of
particulars
he
was
said
to
be
very
shy
he
is
a
shy
man
of
this
there
is
no
doubt
it
may
not
show
on
the
surface
but
the
shyness
is
there
after
days
of
intimacy
one
wonders
to
see
that
it
is
still
in
about
as
strong
force
as
ever
there
is
a
fine
and
beautiful
nature
hidden
behind
it
as
all
know
who
have
read
the
uncle
remus
book
and
a
fine
genius
too
as
all
know
by
the
same
sign
i
seem
to
be
talking
quite
freely
about
this
neighbor
but
in
talking
to
the
public
i
am
but
talking
to
his
personal
friends
and
these
things
are
permissible
among
friends
he
deeply
disappointed
a
number
of
children
who
had
flocked
eagerly
to
mr
cable's
house
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
illustrious
sage
and
oracle
of
the
nation's
nurseries
they
said
why
he
s
white
they
were
grieved
about
it
so
to
console
them
the
book
was
brought
that
they
might
hear
uncle
remus's
tar
baby
story
from
the
lips
of
uncle
remus
himself
or
what
in
their
outraged
eyes
was
left
of
him
but
it
turned
out
that
he
had
never
read
aloud
to
people
and
was
too
shy
to
venture
the
attempt
now
mr
cable
and
i
read
from
books
of
ours
to
show
him
what
an
easy
trick
it
was
but
his
immortal
shyness
was
proof
against
even
this
sagacious
strategy
so
we
had
to
read
about
brer
rabbit
ourselves
mr
harris
ought
to
be
able
to
read
the
negro
dialect
better
than
anybody
else
for
in
the
matter
of
writing
it
he
is
the
only
master
the
country
has
produced
mr
cable
is
the
only
master
in
the
writing
of
french
dialects
that
the
country
has
produced
and
he
reads
them
in
perfection
it
was
a
great
treat
to
hear
him
read
about
jean
ah
poquelin
and
about
innerarity
and
his
famous
pigshoo
representing
louisihanna
rif
fusing
to
hanter
the
union
along
with
passages
of
nicely
shaded
german
dialect
from
a
novel
which
was
still
in
manuscript
it
came
out
in
conversation
that
in
two
different
instances
mr
cable
got
into
grotesque
trouble
by
using
in
his
books
next
to
impossible
french
names
which
nevertheless
happened
to
be
borne
by
living
and
sensitive
citizens
of
new
orleans
his
names
were
either
inventions
or
were
borrowed
from
the
ancient
and
obsolete
past
i
do
not
now
remember
which
but
at
any
rate
living
bearers
of
them
turned
up
and
were
a
good
deal
hurt
at
having
attention
directed
to
themselves
and
their
affairs
in
so
excessively
public
a
manner
mr
warner
and
i
had
an
experience
of
the
same
sort
when
we
wrote
the
book
called
the
gilded
age
there
is
a
character
in
it
called
sellers
i
do
not
remember
what
his
first
name
was
in
the
beginning
but
anyway
mr
warner
did
not
like
it
and
wanted
it
improved
he
asked
me
if
i
was
able
to
imagine
a
person
named
eschol
sellers
of
course
i
said
i
could
not
without
stimulants
he
said
that
away
out
west
once
he
had
met
and
contemplated
and
actually
shaken
hands
with
a
man
bearing
that
impossible
name
eschol
sellers
he
added
it
was
twenty
years
ago
his
name
has
probably
carried
him
off
before
this
and
if
it
hasn't
he
will
never
see
the
book
anyhow
we
will
confiscate
his
name
the
name
you
are
using
is
common
and
therefore
dangerous
there
are
probably
a
thousand
sellerses
bearing
it
and
the
whole
horde
will
come
after
us
but
eschol
sellers
is
a
safe
name
it
is
a
rock
so
we
borrowed
that
name
and
when
the
book
had
been
out
about
a
week
one
of
the
stateliest
and
handsomest
and
most
aristocratic
looking
white
men
that
ever
lived
called
around
with
the
most
formidable
libel
suit
in
his
pocket
that
ever
well
in
brief
we
got
his
permission
to
suppress
an
edition
of
ten
million
footnote
taken
from
memory
and
probably
incorrect
think
it
was
more
copies
of
the
book
and
change
that
name
to
mulberry
sellers
in
future
editions
chapter
sugar
and
postage
one
day
on
the
street
i
encountered
the
man
whom
of
all
men
i
most
wished
to
see
horace
bixby
formerly
pilot
under
me
or
rather
over
me
now
captain
of
the
great
steamer
city
of
baton
rouge
the
latest
and
swiftest
addition
to
the
anchor
line
the
same
slender
figure
the
same
tight
curls
the
same
springy
step
the
same
alertness
the
same
decision
of
eye
and
answering
decision
of
hand
the
same
erect
military
bearing
not
an
inch
gained
or
lost
in
girth
not
an
ounce
gained
or
lost
in
weight
not
a
hair
turned
it
is
a
curious
thing
to
leave
a
man
thirty
five
years
old
and
come
back
at
the
end
of
twenty
one
years
and
find
him
still
only
thirty
five
i
have
not
had
an
experience
of
this
kind
before
i
believe
there
were
some
crow's
feet
but
they
counted
for
next
to
nothing
since
they
were
inconspicuous
his
boat
was
just
in
i
had
been
waiting
several
days
for
her
purposing
to
return
to
st
louis
in
her
the
captain
and
i
joined
a
party
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
guests
of
major
wood
and
went
down
the
river
fifty
four
miles
in
a
swift
tug
to
ex
governor
warmouth's
sugar
plantation
strung
along
below
the
city
were
a
number
of
decayed
ram
shackly
superannuated
old
steamboats
not
one
of
which
had
i
ever
seen
before
they
had
all
been
built
and
worn
out
and
thrown
aside
since
i
was
here
last
this
gives
one
a
realizing
sense
of
the
frailness
of
a
mississippi
boat
and
the
briefness
of
its
life
six
miles
below
town
a
fat
and
battered
brick
chimney
sticking
above
the
magnolias
and
live
oaks
was
pointed
out
as
the
monument
erected
by
an
appreciative
nation
to
celebrate
the
battle
of
new
orleans
jackson's
victory
over
the
british
january
the
war
had
ended
the
two
nations
were
at
peace
but
the
news
had
not
yet
reached
new
orleans
if
we
had
had
the
cable
telegraph
in
those
days
this
blood
would
not
have
been
spilt
those
lives
would
not
have
been
wasted
and
better
still
jackson
would
probably
never
have
been
president
we
have
gotten
over
the
harms
done
us
by
the
war
of
but
not
over
some
of
those
done
us
by
jackson's
presidency
the
warmouth
plantation
covers
a
vast
deal
of
ground
and
the
hospitality
of
the
warmouth
mansion
is
graduated
to
the
same
large
scale
we
saw
steam
plows
at
work
here
for
the
first
time
the
traction
engine
travels
about
on
its
own
wheels
till
it
reaches
the
required
spot
then
it
stands
still
and
by
means
of
a
wire
rope
pulls
the
huge
plow
toward
itself
two
or
three
hundred
yards
across
the
field
between
the
rows
of
cane
the
thing
cuts
down
into
the
black
mold
a
foot
and
a
half
deep
the
plow
looks
like
a
fore
and
aft
brace
of
a
hudson
river
steamer
inverted
when
the
negro
steersman
sits
on
one
end
of
it
that
end
tilts
down
near
the
ground
while
the
other
sticks
up
high
in
air
this
great
see
saw
goes
rolling
and
pitching
like
a
ship
at
sea
and
it
is
not
every
circus
rider
that
could
stay
on
it
the
plantation
contains
two
thousand
six
hundred
acres
six
hundred
and
fifty
are
in
cane
and
there
is
a
fruitful
orange
grove
of
five
thousand
trees
the
cane
is
cultivated
after
a
modern
and
intricate
scientific
fashion
too
elaborate
and
complex
for
me
to
attempt
to
describe
but
it
lost
last
year
i
forget
the
other
details
however
this
year's
crop
will
reach
ten
or
twelve
hundred
tons
of
sugar
consequently
last
year's
loss
will
not
matter
these
troublesome
and
expensive
scientific
methods
achieve
a
yield
of
a
ton
and
a
half
and
from
that
to
two
tons
to
the
acre
which
is
three
or
four
times
what
the
yield
of
an
acre
was
in
my
time
the
drainage
ditches
were
everywhere
alive
with
little
crabs
fiddlers
one
saw
them
scampering
sidewise
in
every
direction
whenever
they
heard
a
disturbing
noise
expensive
pests
these
crabs
for
they
bore
into
the
levees
and
ruin
them
the
great
sugar
house
was
a
wilderness
of
tubs
and
tanks
and
vats
and
filters
pumps
pipes
and
machinery
the
process
of
making
sugar
is
exceedingly
interesting
first
you
heave
your
cane
into
the
centrifugals
and
grind
out
the
juice
then
run
it
through
the
evaporating
pan
to
extract
the
fiber
then
through
the
bone
filter
to
remove
the
alcohol
then
through
the
clarifying
tanks
to
discharge
the
molasses
then
through
the
granulating
pipe
to
condense
it
then
through
the
vacuum
pan
to
extract
the
vacuum
it
is
now
ready
for
market
i
have
jotted
these
particulars
down
from
memory
the
thing
looks
simple
and
easy
do
not
deceive
yourself
to
make
sugar
is
really
one
of
the
most
difficult
things
in
the
world
and
to
make
it
right
is
next
to
impossible
if
you
will
examine
your
own
supply
every
now
and
then
for
a
term
of
years
and
tabulate
the
result
you
will
find
that
not
two
men
in
twenty
can
make
sugar
without
getting
sand
into
it
we
could
have
gone
down
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
visited
captain
eads
great
work
the
jetties
where
the
river
has
been
compressed
between
walls
and
thus
deepened
to
twenty
six
feet
but
it
was
voted
useless
to
go
since
at
this
stage
of
the
water
everything
would
be
covered
up
and
invisible
we
could
have
visited
that
ancient
and
singular
burg
pilot
town
which
stands
on
stilts
in
the
water
so
they
say
where
nearly
all
communication
is
by
skiff
and
canoe
even
to
the
attending
of
weddings
and
funerals
and
where
the
littlest
boys
and
girls
are
as
handy
with
the
oar
as
unamphibious
children
are
with
the
velocipede
we
could
have
done
a
number
of
other
things
but
on
account
of
limited
time
we
went
back
home
the
sail
up
the
breezy
and
sparkling
river
was
a
charming
experience
and
would
have
been
satisfyingly
sentimental
and
romantic
but
for
the
interruptions
of
the
tug's
pet
parrot
whose
tireless
comments
upon
the
scenery
and
the
guests
were
always
this
worldly
and
often
profane
he
had
also
a
superabundance
of
the
discordant
ear
splitting
metallic
laugh
common
to
his
breed
a
machine
made
laugh
a
frankenstein
laugh
with
the
soul
left
out
of
it
he
applied
it
to
every
sentimental
remark
and
to
every
pathetic
song
he
cackled
it
out
with
hideous
energy
after
home
again
home
again
from
a
foreign
shore
and
said
he
wouldn't
give
a
damn
for
a
tug
load
of
such
rot
romance
and
sentiment
cannot
long
survive
this
sort
of
discouragement
so
the
singing
and
talking
presently
ceased
which
so
delighted
the
parrot
that
he
cursed
himself
hoarse
for
joy
then
the
male
members
of
the
party
moved
to
the
forecastle
to
smoke
and
gossip
there
were
several
old
steamboatmen
along
and
i
learned
from
them
a
great
deal
of
what
had
been
happening
to
my
former
river
friends
during
my
long
absence
i
learned
that
a
pilot
whom
i
used
to
steer
for
is
become
a
spiritualist
and
for
more
than
fifteen
years
has
been
receiving
a
letter
every
week
from
a
deceased
relative
through
a
new
york
spiritualist
medium
named
manchester
postage
graduated
by
distance
from
the
local
post
office
in
paradise
to
new
york
five
dollars
from
new
york
to
st
louis
three
cents
i
remember
mr
manchester
very
well
i
called
on
him
once
ten
years
ago
with
a
couple
of
friends
one
of
whom
wished
to
inquire
after
a
deceased
uncle
this
uncle
had
lost
his
life
in
a
peculiarly
violent
and
unusual
way
half
a
dozen
years
before
a
cyclone
blew
him
some
three
miles
and
knocked
a
tree
down
with
him
which
was
four
feet
through
at
the
butt
and
sixty
five
feet
high
he
did
not
survive
this
triumph
at
the
seance
just
referred
to
my
friend
questioned
his
late
uncle
through
mr
manchester
and
the
late
uncle
wrote
down
his
replies
using
mr
manchester's
hand
and
pencil
for
that
purpose
the
following
is
a
fair
example
of
the
questions
asked
and
also
of
the
sloppy
twaddle
in
the
way
of
answers
furnished
by
manchester
under
the
pretense
that
it
came
from
the
specter
if
this
man
is
not
the
paltriest
fraud
that
lives
i
owe
him
an
apology
question
where
are
you
answer
in
the
spirit
world
q
are
you
happy
a
very
happy
perfectly
happy
q
how
do
you
amuse
yourself
a
conversation
with
friends
and
other
spirits
q
what
else
a
nothing
else
nothing
else
is
necessary
q
what
do
you
talk
about
a
about
how
happy
we
are
and
about
friends
left
behind
in
the
earth
and
how
to
influence
them
for
their
good
q
when
your
friends
in
the
earth
all
get
to
the
spirit
land
what
shall
you
have
to
talk
about
then
nothing
but
about
how
happy
you
all
are
no
reply
it
is
explained
that
spirits
will
not
answer
frivolous
questions
q
how
is
it
that
spirits
that
are
content
to
spend
an
eternity
in
frivolous
employments
and
accept
it
as
happiness
are
so
fastidious
about
frivolous
questions
upon
the
subject
no
reply
q
would
you
like
to
come
back
a
no
q
would
you
say
that
under
oath
a
yes
q
what
do
you
eat
there

we
do
not

q
you
know
my
present
way
of
life
can
you
suggest
any
additions
to
it
in
the
way
of
crime
that
will
reasonably
insure
my
going
to
some
other
place
a
no
reply
q
when
did
you
die
a
i
did
not
die
i
passed
away
q
very
well
then
when
did
you
pass
away
how
long
have
you
been
in
the
spirit
land
a
we
have
no
measurements
of
time
here
q
though
you
may
be
indifferent
and
uncertain
as
to
dates
and
times
in
your
present
condition
and
environment
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
former
condition
you
had
dates
then
one
of
these
is
what
i
ask
for
you
departed
on
a
certain
day
in
a
certain
year
is
not
this
true
a
yes
q
then
name
the
day
of
the
month
much
fumbling
with
pencil
on
the
part
of
the
medium
accompanied
by
violent
spasmodic
jerkings
of
his
head
and
body
for
some
little
time
finally
explanation
to
the
effect
that
spirits
often
forget
dates
such
things
being
without
importance
to
them
q
then
this
one
has
actually
forgotten
the
date
of
its
translation
to
the
spirit
land
this
was
granted
to
be
the
case
q
this
is
very
curious
well
then
what
year
was
it
more
fumbling
jerking
idiotic
spasms
on
the
part
of
the
medium
finally
explanation
to
the
effect
that
the
spirit
has
forgotten
the
year
q
this
is
indeed
stupendous
let
me
put
one
more
question
one
last
question
to
you
before
we
part
to
meet
no
more
for
even
if
i
fail
to
avoid
your
asylum
a
meeting
there
will
go
for
nothing
as
a
meeting
since
by
that
time
you
will
easily
have
forgotten
me
and
my
name
did
you
die
a
natural
death
or
were
you
cut
off
by
a
catastrophe
a
after
long
hesitation
and
many
throes
and
spasms
natural
death
this
ended
the
interview
my
friend
told
the
medium
that
when
his
relative
was
in
this
poor
world
he
was
endowed
with
an
extraordinary
intellect
and
an
absolutely
defectless
memory
and
it
seemed
a
great
pity
that
he
had
not
been
allowed
to
keep
some
shred
of
these
for
his
amusement
in
the
realms
of
everlasting
contentment
and
for
the
amazement
and
admiration
of
the
rest
of
the
population
there
this
man
had
plenty
of
clients
has
plenty
yet
he
receives
letters
from
spirits
located
in
every
part
of
the
spirit
world
and
delivers
them
all
over
this
country
through
the
united
states
mail
these
letters
are
filled
with
advice
advice
from
spirits
who
don't
know
as
much
as
a
tadpole
and
this
advice
is
religiously
followed
by
the
receivers
one
of
these
clients
was
a
man
whom
the
spirits
if
one
may
thus
plurally
describe
the
ingenious
manchester
were
teaching
how
to
contrive
an
improved
railway
car
wheel
it
is
coarse
employment
for
a
spirit
but
it
is
higher
and
wholesomer
activity
than
talking
for
ever
about
how
happy
we
are
chapter
episodes
in
pilot
life
in
the
course
of
the
tug
boat
gossip
it
came
out
that
out
of
every
five
of
my
former
friends
who
had
quitted
the
river
four
had
chosen
farming
as
an
occupation
of
course
this
was
not
because
they
were
peculiarly
gifted
agriculturally
and
thus
more
likely
to
succeed
as
farmers
than
in
other
industries
the
reason
for
their
choice
must
be
traced
to
some
other
source
doubtless
they
chose
farming
because
that
life
is
private
and
secluded
from
irruptions
of
undesirable
strangers
like
the
pilot
house
hermitage
and
doubtless
they
also
chose
it
because
on
a
thousand
nights
of
black
storm
and
danger
they
had
noted
the
twinkling
lights
of
solitary
farm
houses
as
the
boat
swung
by
and
pictured
to
themselves
the
serenity
and
security
and
coziness
of
such
refuges
at
such
times
and
so
had
by
and
bye
come
to
dream
of
that
retired
and
peaceful
life
as
the
one
desirable
thing
to
long
for
anticipate
earn
and
at
last
enjoy
but
i
did
not
learn
that
any
of
these
pilot
farmers
had
astonished
anybody
with
their
successes
their
farms
do
not
support
them
they
support
their
farms
the
pilot
farmer
disappears
from
the
river
annually
about
the
breaking
of
spring
and
is
seen
no
more
till
next
frost
then
he
appears
again
in
damaged
homespun
combs
the
hayseed
out
of
his
hair
and
takes
a
pilot
house
berth
for
the
winter
in
this
way
he
pays
the
debts
which
his
farming
has
achieved
during
the
agricultural
season
so
his
river
bondage
is
but
half
broken
he
is
still
the
river's
slave
the
hardest
half
of
the
year
one
of
these
men
bought
a
farm
but
did
not
retire
to
it
he
knew
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
he
did
not
propose
to
pauperize
his
farm
by
applying
his
personal
ignorance
to
working
it
no
he
put
the
farm
into
the
hands
of
an
agricultural
expert
to
be
worked
on
shares
out
of
every
three
loads
of
corn
the
expert
to
have
two
and
the
pilot
the
third
but
at
the
end
of
the
season
the
pilot
received
no
corn
the
expert
explained
that
his
share
was
not
reached
the
farm
produced
only
two
loads
some
of
the
pilots
whom
i
had
known
had
had
adventures
the
outcome
fortunate
sometimes
but
not
in
all
cases
captain
montgomery
whom
i
had
steered
for
when
he
was
a
pilot
commanded
the
confederate
fleet
in
the
great
battle
before
memphis
when
his
vessel
went
down
he
swam
ashore
fought
his
way
through
a
squad
of
soldiers
and
made
a
gallant
and
narrow
escape
he
was
always
a
cool
man
nothing
could
disturb
his
serenity
once
when
he
was
captain
of
the
crescent
city
i
was
bringing
the
boat
into
port
at
new
orleans
and
momently
expecting
orders
from
the
hurricane
deck
but
received
none
i
had
stopped
the
wheels
and
there
my
authority
and
responsibility
ceased
it
was
evening
dim
twilight
the
captain's
hat
was
perched
upon
the
big
bell
and
i
supposed
the
intellectual
end
of
the
captain
was
in
it
but
such
was
not
the
case
the
captain
was
very
strict
therefore
i
knew
better
than
to
touch
a
bell
without
orders
my
duty
was
to
hold
the
boat
steadily
on
her
calamitous
course
and
leave
the
consequences
to
take
care
of
themselves
which
i
did
so
we
went
plowing
past
the
sterns
of
steamboats
and
getting
closer
and
closer
the
crash
was
bound
to
come
very
soon
and
still
that
hat
never
budged
for
alas
the
captain
was
napping
in
the
texas
things
were
becoming
exceedingly
nervous
and
uncomfortable
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
captain
was
not
going
to
appear
in
time
to
see
the
entertainment
but
he
did
just
as
we
were
walking
into
the
stern
of
a
steamboat
he
stepped
out
on
deck
and
said
with
heavenly
serenity
set
her
back
on
both
which
i
did
but
a
trifle
late
however
for
the
next
moment
we
went
smashing
through
that
other
boat's
flimsy
outer
works
with
a
most
prodigious
racket
the
captain
never
said
a
word
to
me
about
the
matter
afterwards
except
to
remark
that
i
had
done
right
and
that
he
hoped
i
would
not
hesitate
to
act
in
the
same
way
again
in
like
circumstances
one
of
the
pilots
whom
i
had
known
when
i
was
on
the
river
had
died
a
very
honorable
death
his
boat
caught
fire
and
he
remained
at
the
wheel
until
he
got
her
safe
to
land
then
he
went
out
over
the
breast
board
with
his
clothing
in
flames
and
was
the
last
person
to
get
ashore
he
died
from
his
injuries
in
the
course
of
two
or
three
hours
and
his
was
the
only
life
lost
the
history
of
mississippi
piloting
affords
six
or
seven
instances
of
this
sort
of
martyrdom
and
half
a
hundred
instances
of
escapes
from
a
like
fate
which
came
within
a
second
or
two
of
being
fatally
too
late
but
there
is
no
instance
of
a
pilot
deserting
his
post
to
save
his
life
while
by
remaining
and
sacrificing
it
he
might
secure
other
lives
from
destruction
it
is
well
worth
while
to
set
down
this
noble
fact
and
well
worth
while
to
put
it
in
italics
too
the
cub
pilot
is
early
admonished
to
despise
all
perils
connected
with
a
pilot's
calling
and
to
prefer
any
sort
of
death
to
the
deep
dishonor
of
deserting
his
post
while
there
is
any
possibility
of
his
being
useful
in
it
and
so
effectively
are
these
admonitions
inculcated
that
even
young
and
but
half
tried
pilots
can
be
depended
upon
to
stick
to
the
wheel
and
die
there
when
occasion
requires
in
a
memphis
graveyard
is
buried
a
young
fellow
who
perished
at
the
wheel
a
great
many
years
ago
in
white
river
to
save
the
lives
of
other
men
he
said
to
the
captain
that
if
the
fire
would
give
him
time
to
reach
a
sand
bar
some
distance
away
all
could
be
saved
but
that
to
land
against
the
bluff
bank
of
the
river
would
be
to
insure
the
loss
of
many
lives
he
reached
the
bar
and
grounded
the
boat
in
shallow
water
but
by
that
time
the
flames
had
closed
around
him
and
in
escaping
through
them
he
was
fatally
burned
he
had
been
urged
to
fly
sooner
but
had
replied
as
became
a
pilot
to
reply
i
will
not
go
if
i
go
nobody
will
be
saved
if
i
stay
no
one
will
be
lost
but
me
i
will
stay
there
were
two
hundred
persons
on
board
and
no
life
was
lost
but
the
pilot's
there
used
to
be
a
monument
to
this
young
fellow
in
that
memphis
graveyard
while
we
tarried
in
memphis
on
our
down
trip
i
started
out
to
look
for
it
but
our
time
was
so
brief
that
i
was
obliged
to
turn
back
before
my
object
was
accomplished
the
tug
boat
gossip
informed
me
that
dick
kennet
was
dead
blown
up
near
memphis
and
killed
that
several
others
whom
i
had
known
had
fallen
in
the
war
one
or
two
of
them
shot
down
at
the
wheel
that
another
and
very
particular
friend
whom
i
had
steered
many
trips
for
had
stepped
out
of
his
house
in
new
orleans
one
night
years
ago
to
collect
some
money
in
a
remote
part
of
the
city
and
had
never
been
seen
again
was
murdered
and
thrown
into
the
river
it
was
thought
that
ben
thornburgh
was
dead
long
ago
also
his
wild
cub
whom
i
used
to
quarrel
with
all
through
every
daylight
watch
a
heedless
reckless
creature
he
was
and
always
in
hot
water
always
in
mischief
an
arkansas
passenger
brought
an
enormous
bear
aboard
one
day
and
chained
him
to
a
life
boat
on
the
hurricane
deck
thornburgh's
cub
could
not
rest
till
he
had
gone
there
and
unchained
the
bear
to
see
what
he
would
do
he
was
promptly
gratified
the
bear
chased
him
around
and
around
the
deck
for
miles
and
miles
with
two
hundred
eager
faces
grinning
through
the
railings
for
audience
and
finally
snatched
off
the
lad's
coat
tail
and
went
into
the
texas
to
chew
it
the
off
watch
turned
out
with
alacrity
and
left
the
bear
in
sole
possession
he
presently
grew
lonesome
and
started
out
for
recreation
he
ranged
the
whole
boat
visited
every
part
of
it
with
an
advance
guard
of
fleeing
people
in
front
of
him
and
a
voiceless
vacancy
behind
him
and
when
his
owner
captured
him
at
last
those
two
were
the
only
visible
beings
anywhere
everybody
else
was
in
hiding
and
the
boat
was
a
solitude
i
was
told
that
one
of
my
pilot
friends
fell
dead
at
the
wheel
from
heart
disease
in
the
captain
was
on
the
roof
at
the
time
he
saw
the
boat
breaking
for
the
shore
shouted
and
got
no
answer
ran
up
and
found
the
pilot
lying
dead
on
the
floor
mr
bixby
had
been
blown
up
in
madrid
bend
was
not
injured
but
the
other
pilot
was
lost
george
ritchie
had
been
blown
up
near
memphis
blown
into
the
river
from
the
wheel
and
disabled
the
water
was
very
cold
he
clung
to
a
cotton
bale
mainly
with
his
teeth
and
floated
until
nearly
exhausted
when
he
was
rescued
by
some
deck
hands
who
were
on
a
piece
of
the
wreck
they
tore
open
the
bale
and
packed
him
in
the
cotton
and
warmed
the
life
back
into
him
and
got
him
safe
to
memphis
he
is
one
of
bixby's
pilots
on
the
baton
rouge
now
into
the
life
of
a
steamboat
clerk
now
dead
had
dropped
a
bit
of
romance
somewhat
grotesque
romance
but
romance
nevertheless
when
i
knew
him
he
was
a
shiftless
young
spendthrift
boisterous
goodhearted
full
of
careless
generosities
and
pretty
conspicuously
promising
to
fool
his
possibilities
away
early
and
come
to
nothing
in
a
western
city
lived
a
rich
and
childless
old
foreigner
and
his
wife
and
in
their
family
was
a
comely
young
girl
sort
of
friend
sort
of
servant
the
young
clerk
of
whom
i
have
been
speaking
whose
name
was
not
george
johnson
but
who
shall
be
called
george
johnson
for
the
purposes
of
this
narrative
got
acquainted
with
this
young
girl
and
they
sinned
and
the
old
foreigner
found
them
out
and
rebuked
them
being
ashamed
they
lied
and
said
they
were
married
that
they
had
been
privately
married
then
the
old
foreigner's
hurt
was
healed
and
he
forgave
and
blessed
them
after
that
they
were
able
to
continue
their
sin
without
concealment
by
and
bye
the
foreigner's
wife
died
and
presently
he
followed
after
her
friends
of
the
family
assembled
to
mourn
and
among
the
mourners
sat
the
two
young
sinners
the
will
was
opened
and
solemnly
read
it
bequeathed
every
penny
of
that
old
man's
great
wealth
to
mrs
george
johnson
and
there
was
no
such
person
the
young
sinners
fled
forth
then
and
did
a
very
foolish
thing
married
themselves
before
an
obscure
justice
of
the
peace
and
got
him
to
antedate
the
thing
that
did
no
sort
of
good
the
distant
relatives
flocked
in
and
exposed
the
fraudful
date
with
extreme
suddenness
and
surprising
ease
and
carried
off
the
fortune
leaving
the
johnsons
very
legitimately
and
legally
and
irrevocably
chained
together
in
honorable
marriage
but
with
not
so
much
as
a
penny
to
bless
themselves
withal
such
are
the
actual
facts
and
not
all
novels
have
for
a
base
so
telling
a
situation
chapter
the
original
jacobs
we
had
some
talk
about
captain
isaiah
sellers
now
many
years
dead
he
was
a
fine
man
a
high
minded
man
and
greatly
respected
both
ashore
and
on
the
river
he
was
very
tall
well
built
and
handsome
and
in
his
old
age
as
i
remember
him
his
hair
was
as
black
as
an
indian's
and
his
eye
and
hand
were
as
strong
and
steady
and
his
nerve
and
judgment
as
firm
and
clear
as
anybody's
young
or
old
among
the
fraternity
of
pilots
he
was
the
patriarch
of
the
craft
he
had
been
a
keelboat
pilot
before
the
day
of
steamboats
and
a
steamboat
pilot
before
any
other
steamboat
pilot
still
surviving
at
the
time
i
speak
of
had
ever
turned
a
wheel
consequently
his
brethren
held
him
in
the
sort
of
awe
in
which
illustrious
survivors
of
a
bygone
age
are
always
held
by
their
associates
he
knew
how
he
was
regarded
and
perhaps
this
fact
added
some
trifle
of
stiffening
to
his
natural
dignity
which
had
been
sufficiently
stiff
in
its
original
state
he
left
a
diary
behind
him
but
apparently
it
did
not
date
back
to
his
first
steamboat
trip
which
was
said
to
be
the
year
the
first
steamboat
disturbed
the
waters
of
the
mississippi
at
the
time
of
his
death
a
correspondent
of
the
st
louis
republican
culled
the
following
items
from
the
diary
in
february
he
shipped
on
board
the
steamer
rambler
at
florence
ala
and
made
during
that
year
three
trips
to
new
orleans
and
back
this
on
the
gen
carrol
between
nashville
and
new
orleans
it
was
during
his
stay
on
this
boat
that
captain
sellers
introduced
the
tap
of
the
bell
as
a
signal
to
heave
the
lead
previous
to
which
time
it
was
the
custom
for
the
pilot
to
speak
to
the
men
below
when
soundings
were
wanted
the
proximity
of
the
forecastle
to
the
pilot
house
no
doubt
rendered
this
an
easy
matter
but
how
different
on
one
of
our
palaces
of
the
present
day
in
we
find
him
on
board
the
president
a
boat
of
two
hundred
and
eighty
five
tons
burden
and
plying
between
smithland
and
new
orleans
thence
he
joined
the
jubilee
in
and
on
this
boat
he
did
his
first
piloting
in
the
st
louis
trade
his
first
watch
extending
from
herculaneum
to
st
genevieve
on
may
he
completed
and
left
pittsburgh
in
charge
of
the
steamer
prairie
a
boat
of
four
hundred
tons
and
the
first
steamer
with
a
state
room
cabin
ever
seen
at
st
louis
in
he
introduced
the
signal
for
meeting
boats
and
which
has
with
some
slight
change
been
the
universal
custom
of
this
day
in
fact
is
rendered
obligatory
by
act
of
congress
as
general
items
of
river
history
we
quote
the
following
marginal
notes
from
his
general
log
in
march
gen
lafayette
left
new
orleans
for
st
louis
on
the
low
pressure
steamer
natchez
in
january
twenty
one
steamers
left
the
new
orleans
wharf
to
celebrate
the
occasion
of
gen
jackson's
visit
to
that
city
in
the
north
american
made
the
run
from
new
orleans
to
memphis
in
six
days
best
time
on
record
to
that
date
it
has
since
been
made
in
two
days
and
ten
hours
in
the
red
river
cut
off
formed
in
steamer
hudson
made
the
run
from
white
river
to
helena
a
distance
of
seventy
five
miles
in
twelve
hours
this
was
the
source
of
much
talk
and
speculation
among
parties
directly
interested
in
great
horseshoe
cut
off
formed
up
to
the
present
time
a
term
of
thirty
five
years
we
ascertain
by
reference
to
the
diary
he
has
made
four
hundred
and
sixty
round
trips
to
new
orleans
which
gives
a
distance
of
one
million
one
hundred
and
four
thousand
miles
or
an
average
of
eighty
six
miles
a
day
whenever
captain
sellers
approached
a
body
of
gossiping
pilots
a
chill
fell
there
and
talking
ceased
for
this
reason
whenever
six
pilots
were
gathered
together
there
would
always
be
one
or
two
newly
fledged
ones
in
the
lot
and
the
elder
ones
would
be
always
showing
off
before
these
poor
fellows
making
them
sorrowfully
feel
how
callow
they
were
how
recent
their
nobility
and
how
humble
their
degree
by
talking
largely
and
vaporously
of
old
time
experiences
on
the
river
always
making
it
a
point
to
date
everything
back
as
far
as
they
could
so
as
to
make
the
new
men
feel
their
newness
to
the
sharpest
degree
possible
and
envy
the
old
stagers
in
the
like
degree
and
how
these
complacent
baldheads
would
swell
and
brag
and
lie
and
date
back
ten
fifteen
twenty
years
and
how
they
did
enjoy
the
effect
produced
upon
the
marveling
and
envying
youngsters
and
perhaps
just
at
this
happy
stage
of
the
proceedings
the
stately
figure
of
captain
isaiah
sellers
that
real
and
only
genuine
son
of
antiquity
would
drift
solemnly
into
the
midst
imagine
the
size
of
the
silence
that
would
result
on
the
instant
and
imagine
the
feelings
of
those
bald
heads
and
the
exultation
of
their
recent
audience
when
the
ancient
captain
would
begin
to
drop
casual
and
indifferent
remarks
of
a
reminiscent
nature
about
islands
that
had
disappeared
and
cutoffs
that
had
been
made
a
generation
before
the
oldest
bald
head
in
the
company
had
ever
set
his
foot
in
a
pilot
house
many
and
many
a
time
did
this
ancient
mariner
appear
on
the
scene
in
the
above
fashion
and
spread
disaster
and
humiliation
around
him
if
one
might
believe
the
pilots
he
always
dated
his
islands
back
to
the
misty
dawn
of
river
history
and
he
never
used
the
same
island
twice
and
never
did
he
employ
an
island
that
still
existed
or
give
one
a
name
which
anybody
present
was
old
enough
to
have
heard
of
before
if
you
might
believe
the
pilots
he
was
always
conscientiously
particular
about
little
details
never
spoke
of
the
state
of
mississippi
for
instance
no
he
would
say
when
the
state
of
mississippi
was
where
arkansas
now
is
and
would
never
speak
of
louisiana
or
missouri
in
a
general
way
and
leave
an
incorrect
impression
on
your
mind
no
he
would
say
when
louisiana
was
up
the
river
farther
or
when
missouri
was
on
the
illinois
side
the
old
gentleman
was
not
of
literary
turn
or
capacity
but
he
used
to
jot
down
brief
paragraphs
of
plain
practical
information
about
the
river
and
sign
them
mark
twain
and
give
them
to
the
new
orleans
picayune
they
related
to
the
stage
and
condition
of
the
river
and
were
accurate
and
valuable
and
thus
far
they
contained
no
poison
but
in
speaking
of
the
stage
of
the
river
to
day
at
a
given
point
the
captain
was
pretty
apt
to
drop
in
a
little
remark
about
this
being
the
first
time
he
had
seen
the
water
so
high
or
so
low
at
that
particular
point
for
forty
nine
years
and
now
and
then
he
would
mention
island
so
and
so
and
follow
it
in
parentheses
with
some
such
observation
as
disappeared
in
if
i
remember
rightly
in
these
antique
interjections
lay
poison
and
bitterness
for
the
other
old
pilots
and
they
used
to
chaff
the
mark
twain
paragraphs
with
unsparing
mockery
it
so
chanced
that
one
of
these
paragraphs
footnote
original
ms
of
it
in
the
captain's
own
hand
has
been
sent
to
me
from
new
orleans
it
reads
as
follows
vicksburg
may
my
opinion
for
the
benefit
of
the
citizens
of
new
orleans
the
water
is
higher
this
far
up
than
it
has
been
since
my
opinion
is
that
the
water
will
be
feet
deep
in
canal
street
before
the
first
of
next
june
mrs
turner's
plantation
at
the
head
of
big
black
island
is
all
under
water
and
it
has
not
been
since
i
sellers
became
the
text
for
my
first
newspaper
article
i
burlesqued
it
broadly
very
broadly
stringing
my
fantastics
out
to
the
extent
of
eight
hundred
or
a
thousand
words
i
was
a
cub
at
the
time
i
showed
my
performance
to
some
pilots
and
they
eagerly
rushed
it
into
print
in
the
new
orleans
true
delta
it
was
a
great
pity
for
it
did
nobody
any
worthy
service
and
it
sent
a
pang
deep
into
a
good
man's
heart
there
was
no
malice
in
my
rubbish
but
it
laughed
at
the
captain
it
laughed
at
a
man
to
whom
such
a
thing
was
new
and
strange
and
dreadful
i
did
not
know
then
though
i
do
now
that
there
is
no
suffering
comparable
with
that
which
a
private
person
feels
when
he
is
for
the
first
time
pilloried
in
print
captain
sellers
did
me
the
honor
to
profoundly
detest
me
from
that
day
forth
when
i
say
he
did
me
the
honor
i
am
not
using
empty
words
it
was
a
very
real
honor
to
be
in
the
thoughts
of
so
great
a
man
as
captain
sellers
and
i
had
wit
enough
to
appreciate
it
and
be
proud
of
it
it
was
distinction
to
be
loved
by
such
a
man
but
it
was
a
much
greater
distinction
to
be
hated
by
him
because
he
loved
scores
of
people
but
he
didn't
sit
up
nights
to
hate
anybody
but
me
he
never
printed
another
paragraph
while
he
lived
and
he
never
again
signed
mark
twain
to
anything
at
the
time
that
the
telegraph
brought
the
news
of
his
death
i
was
on
the
pacific
coast
i
was
a
fresh
new
journalist
and
needed
a
nom
de
guerre
so
i
confiscated
the
ancient
mariner's
discarded
one
and
have
done
my
best
to
make
it
remain
what
it
was
in
his
hands
a
sign
and
symbol
and
warrant
that
whatever
is
found
in
its
company
may
be
gambled
on
as
being
the
petrified
truth
how
i
have
succeeded
it
would
not
be
modest
in
me
to
say
the
captain
had
an
honorable
pride
in
his
profession
and
an
abiding
love
for
it
he
ordered
his
monument
before
he
died
and
kept
it
near
him
until
he
did
die
it
stands
over
his
grave
now
in
bellefontaine
cemetery
st
louis
it
is
his
image
in
marble
standing
on
duty
at
the
pilot
wheel
and
worthy
to
stand
and
confront
criticism
for
it
represents
a
man
who
in
life
would
have
stayed
there
till
he
burned
to
a
cinder
if
duty
required
it
the
finest
thing
we
saw
on
our
whole
mississippi
trip
we
saw
as
we
approached
new
orleans
in
the
steam
tug
this
was
the
curving
frontage
of
the
crescent
city
lit
up
with
the
white
glare
of
five
miles
of
electric
lights
it
was
a
wonderful
sight
and
very
beautiful
chapter
reminiscences
we
left
for
st
louis
in
the
city
of
baton
rouge
on
a
delightfully
hot
day
but
with
the
main
purpose
of
my
visit
but
lamely
accomplished
i
had
hoped
to
hunt
up
and
talk
with
a
hundred
steamboatmen
but
got
so
pleasantly
involved
in
the
social
life
of
the
town
that
i
got
nothing
more
than
mere
five
minute
talks
with
a
couple
of
dozen
of
the
craft
i
was
on
the
bench
of
the
pilot
house
when
we
backed
out
and
straightened
up
for
the
start
the
boat
pausing
for
a
good
ready
in
the
old
fashioned
way
and
the
black
smoke
piling
out
of
the
chimneys
equally
in
the
old
fashioned
way
then
we
began
to
gather
momentum
and
presently
were
fairly
under
way
and
booming
along
it
was
all
as
natural
and
familiar
and
so
were
the
shoreward
sights
as
if
there
had
been
no
break
in
my
river
life
there
was
a
cub
and
i
judged
that
he
would
take
the
wheel
now
and
he
did
captain
bixby
stepped
into
the
pilot
house
presently
the
cub
closed
up
on
the
rank
of
steamships
he
made
me
nervous
for
he
allowed
too
much
water
to
show
between
our
boat
and
the
ships
i
knew
quite
well
what
was
going
to
happen
because
i
could
date
back
in
my
own
life
and
inspect
the
record
the
captain
looked
on
during
a
silent
half
minute
then
took
the
wheel
himself
and
crowded
the
boat
in
till
she
went
scraping
along
within
a
hand
breadth
of
the
ships
it
was
exactly
the
favor
which
he
had
done
me
about
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
in
that
same
spot
the
first
time
i
ever
steamed
out
of
the
port
of
new
orleans
it
was
a
very
great
and
sincere
pleasure
to
me
to
see
the
thing
repeated
with
somebody
else
as
victim
we
made
natchez
three
hundred
miles
in
twenty
two
hours
and
a
half
much
the
swiftest
passage
i
have
ever
made
over
that
piece
of
water
the
next
morning
i
came
on
with
the
four
o'clock
watch
and
saw
ritchie
successfully
run
half
a
dozen
crossings
in
a
fog
using
for
his
guidance
the
marked
chart
devised
and
patented
by
bixby
and
himself
this
sufficiently
evidenced
the
great
value
of
the
chart
by
and
by
when
the
fog
began
to
clear
off
i
noticed
that
the
reflection
of
a
tree
in
the
smooth
water
of
an
overflowed
bank
six
hundred
yards
away
was
stronger
and
blacker
than
the
ghostly
tree
itself
the
faint
spectral
trees
dimly
glimpsed
through
the
shredding
fog
were
very
pretty
things
to
see
we
had
a
heavy
thunder
storm
at
natchez
another
at
vicksburg
and
still
another
about
fifty
miles
below
memphis
they
had
an
old
fashioned
energy
which
had
long
been
unfamiliar
to
me
this
third
storm
was
accompanied
by
a
raging
wind
we
tied
up
to
the
bank
when
we
saw
the
tempest
coming
and
everybody
left
the
pilot
house
but
me
the
wind
bent
the
young
trees
down
exposing
the
pale
underside
of
the
leaves
and
gust
after
gust
followed
in
quick
succession
thrashing
the
branches
violently
up
and
down
and
to
this
side
and
that
and
creating
swift
waves
of
alternating
green
and
white
according
to
the
side
of
the
leaf
that
was
exposed
and
these
waves
raced
after
each
other
as
do
their
kind
over
a
wind
tossed
field
of
oats
no
color
that
was
visible
anywhere
was
quite
natural
all
tints
were
charged
with
a
leaden
tinge
from
the
solid
cloud
bank
overhead
the
river
was
leaden
all
distances
the
same
and
even
the
far
reaching
ranks
of
combing
white
caps
were
dully
shaded
by
the
dark
rich
atmosphere
through
which
their
swarming
legions
marched
the
thunder
peals
were
constant
and
deafening
explosion
followed
explosion
with
but
inconsequential
intervals
between
and
the
reports
grew
steadily
sharper
and
higher
keyed
and
more
trying
to
the
ear
the
lightning
was
as
diligent
as
the
thunder
and
produced
effects
which
enchanted
the
eye
and
sent
electric
ecstasies
of
mixed
delight
and
apprehension
shivering
along
every
nerve
in
the
body
in
unintermittent
procession
the
rain
poured
down
in
amazing
volume
the
ear
splitting
thunder
peals
broke
nearer
and
nearer
the
wind
increased
in
fury
and
began
to
wrench
off
boughs
and
tree
tops
and
send
them
sailing
away
through
space
the
pilot
house
fell
to
rocking
and
straining
and
cracking
and
surging
and
i
went
down
in
the
hold
to
see
what
time
it
was
people
boast
a
good
deal
about
alpine
thunderstorms
but
the
storms
which
i
have
had
the
luck
to
see
in
the
alps
were
not
the
equals
of
some
which
i
have
seen
in
the
mississippi
valley
i
may
not
have
seen
the
alps
do
their
best
of
course
and
if
they
can
beat
the
mississippi
i
don't
wish
to
on
this
up
trip
i
saw
a
little
towhead
infant
island
half
a
mile
long
which
had
been
formed
during
the
past
nineteen
years
since
there
was
so
much
time
to
spare
that
nineteen
years
of
it
could
be
devoted
to
the
construction
of
a
mere
towhead
where
was
the
use
originally
in
rushing
this
whole
globe
through
in
six
days
it
is
likely
that
if
more
time
had
been
taken
in
the
first
place
the
world
would
have
been
made
right
and
this
ceaseless
improving
and
repairing
would
not
be
necessary
now
but
if
you
hurry
a
world
or
a
house
you
are
nearly
sure
to
find
out
by
and
by
that
you
have
left
out
a
towhead
or
a
broom
closet
or
some
other
little
convenience
here
and
there
which
has
got
to
be
supplied
no
matter
how
much
expense
and
vexation
it
may
cost
we
had
a
succession
of
black
nights
going
up
the
river
and
it
was
observable
that
whenever
we
landed
and
suddenly
inundated
the
trees
with
the
intense
sunburst
of
the
electric
light
a
certain
curious
effect
was
always
produced
hundreds
of
birds
flocked
instantly
out
from
the
masses
of
shining
green
foliage
and
went
careering
hither
and
thither
through
the
white
rays
and
often
a
song
bird
tuned
up
and
fell
to
singing
we
judged
that
they
mistook
this
superb
artificial
day
for
the
genuine
article
we
had
a
delightful
trip
in
that
thoroughly
well
ordered
steamer
and
regretted
that
it
was
accomplished
so
speedily
by
means
of
diligence
and
activity
we
managed
to
hunt
out
nearly
all
the
old
friends
one
was
missing
however
he
went
to
his
reward
whatever
it
was
two
years
ago
but
i
found
out
all
about
him
his
case
helped
me
to
realize
how
lasting
can
be
the
effect
of
a
very
trifling
occurrence
when
he
was
an
apprentice
blacksmith
in
our
village
and
i
a
schoolboy
a
couple
of
young
englishmen
came
to
the
town
and
sojourned
a
while
and
one
day
they
got
themselves
up
in
cheap
royal
finery
and
did
the
richard
iii
swordfight
with
maniac
energy
and
prodigious
powwow
in
the
presence
of
the
village
boys
this
blacksmith
cub
was
there
and
the
histrionic
poison
entered
his
bones
this
vast
lumbering
ignorant
dull
witted
lout
was
stage
struck
and
irrecoverably
he
disappeared
and
presently
turned
up
in
st
louis
i
ran
across
him
there
by
and
by
he
was
standing
musing
on
a
street
corner
with
his
left
hand
on
his
hip
the
thumb
of
his
right
supporting
his
chin
face
bowed
and
frowning
slouch
hat
pulled
down
over
his
forehead
imagining
himself
to
be
othello
or
some
such
character
and
imagining
that
the
passing
crowd
marked
his
tragic
bearing
and
were
awestruck
i
joined
him
and
tried
to
get
him
down
out
of
the
clouds
but
did
not
succeed
however
he
casually
informed
me
presently
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
walnut
street
theater
company
and
he
tried
to
say
it
with
indifference
but
the
indifference
was
thin
and
a
mighty
exultation
showed
through
it
he
said
he
was
cast
for
a
part
in
julius
caesar
for
that
night
and
if
i
should
come
i
would
see
him
if
i
should
come
i
said
i
wouldn't
miss
it
if
i
were
dead
i
went
away
stupefied
with
astonishment
and
saying
to
myself
how
strange
it
is
we
always
thought
this
fellow
a
fool
yet
the
moment
he
comes
to
a
great
city
where
intelligence
and
appreciation
abound
the
talent
concealed
in
this
shabby
napkin
is
at
once
discovered
and
promptly
welcomed
and
honored
but
i
came
away
from
the
theater
that
night
disappointed
and
offended
for
i
had
had
no
glimpse
of
my
hero
and
his
name
was
not
in
the
bills
i
met
him
on
the
street
the
next
morning
and
before
i
could
speak
he
asked
did
you
see
me
no
you
weren't
there
he
looked
surprised
and
disappointed
he
said
yes
i
was
indeed
i
was
i
was
a
roman
soldier
which
one
why
didn't
you
see
them
roman
soldiers
that
stood
back
there
in
a
rank
and
sometimes
marched
in
procession
around
the
stage
do
you
mean
the
roman
army
those
six
sandaled
roustabouts
in
nightshirts
with
tin
shields
and
helmets
that
marched
around
treading
on
each
other's
heels
in
charge
of
a
spider
legged
consumptive
dressed
like
themselves
that's
it
that's
it
i
was
one
of
them
roman
soldiers
i
was
the
next
to
the
last
one
a
half
a
year
ago
i
used
to
always
be
the
last
one
but
i've
been
promoted
well
they
told
me
that
that
poor
fellow
remained
a
roman
soldier
to
the
last
a
matter
of
thirty
four
years
sometimes
they
cast
him
for
a
speaking
part
but
not
an
elaborate
one
he
could
be
trusted
to
go
and
say
my
lord
the
carriage
waits
but
if
they
ventured
to
add
a
sentence
or
two
to
this
his
memory
felt
the
strain
and
he
was
likely
to
miss
fire
yet
poor
devil
he
had
been
patiently
studying
the
part
of
hamlet
for
more
than
thirty
years
and
he
lived
and
died
in
the
belief
that
some
day
he
would
be
invited
to
play
it
and
this
is
what
came
of
that
fleeting
visit
of
those
young
englishmen
to
our
village
such
ages
and
ages
ago
what
noble
horseshoes
this
man
might
have
made
but
for
those
englishmen
and
what
an
inadequate
roman
soldier
he
did
make
a
day
or
two
after
we
reached
st
louis
i
was
walking
along
fourth
street
when
a
grizzly
headed
man
gave
a
sort
of
start
as
he
passed
me
then
stopped
came
back
inspected
me
narrowly
with
a
clouding
brow
and
finally
said
with
deep
asperity
look
here
have
you
got
that
drink
yet
a
maniac
i
judged
at
first
but
all
in
a
flash
i
recognized
him
i
made
an
effort
to
blush
that
strained
every
muscle
in
me
and
answered
as
sweetly
and
winningly
as
ever
i
knew
how
been
a
little
slow
but
am
just
this
minute
closing
in
on
the
place
where
they
keep
it
come
in
and
help
he
softened
and
said
make
it
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
he
was
agreeable
he
said
he
had
seen
my
name
in
the
papers
and
had
put
all
his
affairs
aside
and
turned
out
resolved
to
find
me
or
die
and
make
me
answer
that
question
satisfactorily
or
kill
me
though
the
most
of
his
late
asperity
had
been
rather
counterfeit
than
otherwise
this
meeting
brought
back
to
me
the
st
louis
riots
of
about
thirty
years
ago
i
spent
a
week
there
at
that
time
in
a
boarding
house
and
had
this
young
fellow
for
a
neighbor
across
the
hall
we
saw
some
of
the
fightings
and
killings
and
by
and
by
we
went
one
night
to
an
armory
where
two
hundred
young
men
had
met
upon
call
to
be
armed
and
go
forth
against
the
rioters
under
command
of
a
military
man
we
drilled
till
about
ten
o'clock
at
night
then
news
came
that
the
mob
were
in
great
force
in
the
lower
end
of
the
town
and
were
sweeping
everything
before
them
our
column
moved
at
once
it
was
a
very
hot
night
and
my
musket
was
very
heavy
we
marched
and
marched
and
the
nearer
we
approached
the
seat
of
war
the
hotter
i
grew
and
the
thirstier
i
got
i
was
behind
my
friend
so
finally
i
asked
him
to
hold
my
musket
while
i
dropped
out
and
got
a
drink
then
i
branched
off
and
went
home
i
was
not
feeling
any
solicitude
about
him
of
course
because
i
knew
he
was
so
well
armed
now
that
he
could
take
care
of
himself
without
any
trouble
if
i
had
had
any
doubts
about
that
i
would
have
borrowed
another
musket
for
him
i
left
the
city
pretty
early
the
next
morning
and
if
this
grizzled
man
had
not
happened
to
encounter
my
name
in
the
papers
the
other
day
in
st
louis
and
felt
moved
to
seek
me
out
i
should
have
carried
to
my
grave
a
heart
torturing
uncertainty
as
to
whether
he
ever
got
out
of
the
riots
all
right
or
not
i
ought
to
have
inquired
thirty
years
ago
i
know
that
and
i
would
have
inquired
if
i
had
had
the
muskets
but
in
the
circumstances
he
seemed
better
fixed
to
conduct
the
investigations
than
i
was
one
monday
near
the
time
of
our
visit
to
st
louis
the
globe
democrat
came
out
with
a
couple
of
pages
of
sunday
statistics
whereby
it
appeared
that
st
louis
people
attended
the
morning
and
evening
church
services
the
day
before
and
children
attended
sunday
school
thus
persons
out
of
the
city's
total
of
population
respected
the
day
religious
wise
i
found
these
statistics
in
a
condensed
form
in
a
telegram
of
the
associated
press
and
preserved
them
they
made
it
apparent
that
st
louis
was
in
a
higher
state
of
grace
than
she
could
have
claimed
to
be
in
my
time
but
now
that
i
canvass
the
figures
narrowly
i
suspect
that
the
telegraph
mutilated
them
it
cannot
be
that
there
are
more
than
catholics
in
the
town
the
other
must
be
classified
as
protestants
out
of
these
according
to
this
questionable
telegram
only
attended
church
and
sunday
school
while
out
of
the
catholics
went
to
church
and
sunday
school
chapter
a
burning
brand
all
at
once
the
thought
came
into
my
mind
i
have
not
sought
out
mr
brown
upon
that
text
i
desire
to
depart
from
the
direct
line
of
my
subject
and
make
a
little
excursion
i
wish
to
reveal
a
secret
which
i
have
carried
with
me
nine
years
and
which
has
become
burdensome
upon
a
certain
occasion
nine
years
ago
i
had
said
with
strong
feeling
if
ever
i
see
st
louis
again
i
will
seek
out
mr
brown
the
great
grain
merchant
and
ask
of
him
the
privilege
of
shaking
him
by
the
hand
the
occasion
and
the
circumstances
were
as
follows
a
friend
of
mine
a
clergyman
came
one
evening
and
said
i
have
a
most
remarkable
letter
here
which
i
want
to
read
to
you
if
i
can
do
it
without
breaking
down
i
must
preface
it
with
some
explanations
however
the
letter
is
written
by
an
ex
thief
and
ex
vagabond
of
the
lowest
origin
and
basest
rearing
a
man
all
stained
with
crime
and
steeped
in
ignorance
but
thank
god
with
a
mine
of
pure
gold
hidden
away
in
him
as
you
shall
see
his
letter
is
written
to
a
burglar
named
williams
who
is
serving
a
nine
year
term
in
a
certain
state
prison
for
burglary
williams
was
a
particularly
daring
burglar
and
plied
that
trade
during
a
number
of
years
but
he
was
caught
at
last
and
jailed
to
await
trial
in
a
town
where
he
had
broken
into
a
house
at
night
pistol
in
hand
and
forced
the
owner
to
hand
over
to
him
in
government
bonds
williams
was
not
a
common
sort
of
person
by
any
means
he
was
a
graduate
of
harvard
college
and
came
of
good
new
england
stock
his
father
was
a
clergyman
while
lying
in
jail
his
health
began
to
fail
and
he
was
threatened
with
consumption
this
fact
together
with
the
opportunity
for
reflection
afforded
by
solitary
confinement
had
its
effect
its
natural
effect
he
fell
into
serious
thought
his
early
training
asserted
itself
with
power
and
wrought
with
strong
influence
upon
his
mind
and
heart
he
put
his
old
life
behind
him
and
became
an
earnest
christian
some
ladies
in
the
town
heard
of
this
visited
him
and
by
their
encouraging
words
supported
him
in
his
good
resolutions
and
strengthened
him
to
continue
in
his
new
life
the
trial
ended
in
his
conviction
and
sentence
to
the
state
prison
for
the
term
of
nine
years
as
i
have
before
said
in
the
prison
he
became
acquainted
with
the
poor
wretch
referred
to
in
the
beginning
of
my
talk
jack
hunt
the
writer
of
the
letter
which
i
am
going
to
read
you
will
see
that
the
acquaintanceship
bore
fruit
for
hunt
when
hunt's
time
was
out
he
wandered
to
st
louis
and
from
that
place
he
wrote
his
letter
to
williams
the
letter
got
no
further
than
the
office
of
the
prison
warden
of
course
prisoners
are
not
often
allowed
to
receive
letters
from
outside
the
prison
authorities
read
this
letter
but
did
not
destroy
it
they
had
not
the
heart
to
do
it
they
read
it
to
several
persons
and
eventually
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
those
ladies
of
whom
i
spoke
a
while
ago
the
other
day
i
came
across
an
old
friend
of
mine
a
clergyman
who
had
seen
this
letter
and
was
full
of
it
the
mere
remembrance
of
it
so
moved
him
that
he
could
not
talk
of
it
without
his
voice
breaking
he
promised
to
get
a
copy
of
it
for
me
and
here
it
is
an
exact
copy
with
all
the
imperfections
of
the
original
preserved
it
has
many
slang
expressions
in
it
thieves
argot
but
their
meaning
has
been
interlined
in
parentheses
by
the
prison
authorities
st
louis
june
mr
w
friend
charlie
if
i
may
call
you
so
i
no
you
are
surprised
to
get
a
letter
from
me
but
i
hope
you
won't
be
mad
at
my
writing
to
you
i
want
to
tell
you
my
thanks
for
the
way
you
talked
to
me
when
i
was
in
prison
it
has
led
me
to
try
and
be
a
better
man
i
guess
you
thought
i
did
not
cair
for
what
you
said
at
the
first
go
off
i
didn't
but
i
noed
you
was
a
man
who
had
don
big
work
with
good
men
want
no
sucker
nor
want
gasing
all
the
boys
knod
it
i
used
to
think
at
nite
what
you
said
for
it
i
nocked
off
swearing
months
before
my
time
was
up
for
i
saw
it
want
no
good
nohow
the
day
my
time
was
up
you
told
me
if
i
would
shake
the
cross
quit
stealing
live
on
the
square
for
months
it
would
be
the
best
job
i
ever
done
in
my
life
the
state
agent
give
me
a
ticket
to
here
on
the
car
i
thought
more
of
what
you
said
to
me
but
didn't
make
up
my
mind
when
we
got
to
chicago
on
the
cars
from
there
to
here
i
pulled
off
an
old
woman's
leather
robbed
her
of
her
pocketbook
i
hadn't
no
more
than
got
it
off
when
i
wished
i
hadn't
done
it
for
awhile
before
that
i
made
up
my
mind
to
be
a
square
bloke
for
months
on
your
word
but
forgot
it
when
i
saw
the
leather
was
a
grip
easy
to
get
but
i
kept
clos
to
her
when
she
got
out
of
the
cars
at
a
way
place
i
said
marm
have
you
lost
anything
she
tumbled
discovered
her
leather
was
off
gone
is
this
it
says
i
giving
it
to
her
well
if
you
aint
honest
says
she
but
i
hadn't
got
cheak
enough
to
stand
that
sort
of
talk
so
i
left
her
in
a
hurry
when
i
got
here
i
had
and
cents
left

didn't
get
no
work
for

a
deck

the
afternoon
of
the
day
i
spent
my
last
cts

cheese
i
felt
pretty
rough

thinking
i
would
have
to

when
i
thought
of
what
you
once
said
about
a

calling
on
the
lord
when
he
was
in
hard
luck
i
thought
i

mr
brown
is
going
to
write
to
you
sometime
i
hope
some
day
you
will
write
to
me
this
letter
is
from
your
very
true
friend
c
w
who
you
know
as
jack
hunt
i
send
you
mr
brown's
card
send
my
letter
to
him
here
was
true
eloquence
irresistible
eloquence
and
without
a
single
grace
or
ornament
to
help
it
out
i
have
seldom
been
so
deeply
stirred
by
any
piece
of
writing
the
reader
of
it
halted
all
the
way
through
on
a
lame
and
broken
voice
yet
he
had
tried
to
fortify
his
feelings
by
several
private
readings
of
the
letter
before
venturing
into
company
with
it
he
was
practising
upon
me
to
see
if
there
was
any
hope
of
his
being
able
to
read
the
document
to
his
prayer
meeting
with
anything
like
a
decent
command
over
his
feelings
the
result
was
not
promising
however
he
determined
to
risk
it
and
did
he
got
through
tolerably
well
but
his
audience
broke
down
early
and
stayed
in
that
condition
to
the
end
the
fame
of
the
letter
spread
through
the
town
a
brother
minister
came
and
borrowed
the
manuscript
put
it
bodily
into
a
sermon
preached
the
sermon
to
twelve
hundred
people
on
a
sunday
morning
and
the
letter
drowned
them
in
their
own
tears
then
my
friend
put
it
into
a
sermon
and
went
before
his
sunday
morning
congregation
with
it
it
scored
another
triumph
the
house
wept
as
one
individual
my
friend
went
on
summer
vacation
up
into
the
fishing
regions
of
our
northern
british
neighbors
and
carried
this
sermon
with
him
since
he
might
possibly
chance
to
need
a
sermon
he
was
asked
to
preach
one
day
the
little
church
was
full
among
the
people
present
were
the
late
dr
j
g
holland
the
late
mr
seymour
of
the
new
york
times
mr
page
the
philanthropist
and
temperance
advocate
and
i
think
senator
frye
of
maine
the
marvelous
letter
did
its
wonted
work
all
the
people
were
moved
all
the
people
wept
the
tears
flowed
in
a
steady
stream
down
dr
holland's
cheeks
and
nearly
the
same
can
be
said
with
regard
to
all
who
were
there
mr
page
was
so
full
of
enthusiasm
over
the
letter
that
he
said
he
would
not
rest
until
he
made
pilgrimage
to
that
prison
and
had
speech
with
the
man
who
had
been
able
to
inspire
a
fellow
unfortunate
to
write
so
priceless
a
tract
ah
that
unlucky
page
and
another
man
if
they
had
only
been
in
jericho
that
letter
would
have
rung
through
the
world
and
stirred
all
the
hearts
of
all
the
nations
for
a
thousand
years
to
come
and
nobody
might
ever
have
found
out
that
it
was
the
confoundedest
brazenest
ingeniousest
piece
of
fraud
and
humbuggery
that
was
ever
concocted
to
fool
poor
confiding
mortals
with
the
letter
was
a
pure
swindle
and
that
is
the
truth
and
take
it
by
and
large
it
was
without
a
compeer
among
swindles
it
was
perfect
it
was
rounded
symmetrical
complete
colossal
the
reader
learns
it
at
this
point
but
we
didn't
learn
it
till
some
miles
and
weeks
beyond
this
stage
of
the
affair
my
friend
came
back
from
the
woods
and
he
and
other
clergymen
and
lay
missionaries
began
once
more
to
inundate
audiences
with
their
tears
and
the
tears
of
said
audiences
i
begged
hard
for
permission
to
print
the
letter
in
a
magazine
and
tell
the
watery
story
of
its
triumphs
numbers
of
people
got
copies
of
the
letter
with
permission
to
circulate
them
in
writing
but
not
in
print
copies
were
sent
to
the
sandwich
islands
and
other
far
regions
charles
dudley
warner
was
at
church
one
day
when
the
worn
letter
was
read
and
wept
over
at
the
church
door
afterward
he
dropped
a
peculiarly
cold
iceberg
down
the
clergyman's
back
with
the
question
do
you
know
that
letter
to
be
genuine
it
was
the
first
suspicion
that
had
ever
been
voiced
but
it
had
that
sickening
effect
which
first
uttered
suspicions
against
one's
idol
always
have
some
talk
followed
why
what
should
make
you
suspect
that
it
isn't
genuine
nothing
that
i
know
of
except
that
it
is
too
neat
and
compact
and
fluent
and
nicely
put
together
for
an
ignorant
person
an
unpractised
hand
i
think
it
was
done
by
an
educated
man
the
literary
artist
had
detected
the
literary
machinery
if
you
will
look
at
the
letter
now
you
will
detect
it
yourself
it
is
observable
in
every
line
straightway
the
clergyman
went
off
with
this
seed
of
suspicion
sprouting
in
him
and
wrote
to
a
minister
residing
in
that
town
where
williams
had
been
jailed
and
converted
asked
for
light
and
also
asked
if
a
person
in
the
literary
line
meaning
me
might
be
allowed
to
print
the
letter
and
tell
its
history
he
presently
received
this
answer
rev
my
dear
friend
in
regard
to
that
convict's
letter
there
can
be
no
doubt
as
to
its
genuineness
williams
to
whom
it
was
written
lay
in
our
jail
and
professed
to
have
been
converted
and
rev
mr
the
chaplain
had
great
faith
in
the
genuineness
of
the
change
as
much
as
one
can
have
in
any
such
case
the
letter
was
sent
to
one
of
our
ladies
who
is
a
sunday
school
teacher
sent
either
by
williams
himself
or
the
chaplain
of
the
state's
prison
probably
she
has
been
greatly
annoyed
in
having
so
much
publicity
lest
it
might
seem
a
breach
of
confidence
or
be
an
injury
to
williams
in
regard
to
its
publication
i
can
give
no
permission
though
if
the
names
and
places
were
omitted
and
especially
if
sent
out
of
the
country
i
think
you
might
take
the
responsibility
and
do
it
it
is
a
wonderful
letter
which
no
christian
genius
much
less
one
unsanctified
could
ever
have
written
as
showing
the
work
of
grace
in
a
human
heart
and
in
a
very
degraded
and
wicked
one
it
proves
its
own
origin
and
reproves
our
weak
faith
in
its
power
to
cope
with
any
form
of
wickedness
mr
brown
of
st
louis
some
one
said
was
a
hartford
man
do
all
whom
you
send
from
hartford
serve
their
master
as
well
p
s
williams
is
still
in
the
state's
prison
serving
out
a
long
sentence
of
nine
years
i
think
he
has
been
sick
and
threatened
with
consumption
but
i
have
not
inquired
after
him
lately
this
lady
that
i
speak
of
corresponds
with
him
i
presume
and
will
be
quite
sure
to
look
after
him
this
letter
arrived
a
few
days
after
it
was
written
and
up
went
mr
williams's
stock
again
mr
warner's
low
down
suspicion
was
laid
in
the
cold
cold
grave
where
it
apparently
belonged
it
was
a
suspicion
based
upon
mere
internal
evidence
anyway
and
when
you
come
to
internal
evidence
it's
a
big
field
and
a
game
that
two
can
play
at
as
witness
this
other
internal
evidence
discovered
by
the
writer
of
the
note
above
quoted
that
it
is
a
wonderful
letter
which
no
christian
genius
much
less
one
unsanctified
could
ever
have
written
i
had
permission
now
to
print
provided
i
suppressed
names
and
places
and
sent
my
narrative
out
of
the
country
so
i
chose
an
australian
magazine
for
vehicle
as
being
far
enough
out
of
the
country
and
set
myself
to
work
on
my
article
and
the
ministers
set
the
pumps
going
again
with
the
letter
to
work
the
handles
but
meantime
brother
page
had
been
agitating
he
had
not
visited
the
penitentiary
but
he
had
sent
a
copy
of
the
illustrious
letter
to
the
chaplain
of
that
institution
and
accompanied
it
with
apparently
inquiries
he
got
an
answer
dated
four
days
later
than
that
other
brother's
reassuring
epistle
and
before
my
article
was
complete
it
wandered
into
my
hands
the
original
is
before
me
now
and
i
here
append
it
it
is
pretty
well
loaded
with
internal
evidence
of
the
most
solid
description
state's
prison
chaplain's
office
july
dear
bro
page
herewith
please
find
the
letter
kindly
loaned
me
i
am
afraid
its
genuineness
cannot
be
established
it
purports
to
be
addressed
to
some
prisoner
here
no
such
letter
ever
came
to
a
prisoner
here
all
letters
received
are
carefully
read
by
officers
of
the
prison
before
they
go
into
the
hands
of
the
convicts
and
any
such
letter
could
not
be
forgotten
again
charles
williams
is
not
a
christian
man
but
a
dissolute
cunning
prodigal
whose
father
is
a
minister
of
the
gospel
his
name
is
an
assumed
one
i
am
glad
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
i
am
preparing
a
lecture
upon
life
seen
through
prison
bars
and
should
like
to
deliver
the
same
in
your
vicinity
and
so
ended
that
little
drama
my
poor
article
went
into
the
fire
for
whereas
the
materials
for
it
were
now
more
abundant
and
infinitely
richer
than
they
had
previously
been
there
were
parties
all
around
me
who
although
longing
for
the
publication
before
were
a
unit
for
suppression
at
this
stage
and
complexion
of
the
game
they
said
wait
the
wound
is
too
fresh
yet
all
the
copies
of
the
famous
letter
except
mine
disappeared
suddenly
and
from
that
time
onward
the
aforetime
same
old
drought
set
in
in
the
churches
as
a
rule
the
town
was
on
a
spacious
grin
for
a
while
but
there
were
places
in
it
where
the
grin
did
not
appear
and
where
it
was
dangerous
to
refer
to
the
ex
convict's
letter
a
word
of
explanation
jack
hunt
the
professed
writer
of
the
letter
was
an
imaginary
person
the
burglar
williams
harvard
graduate
son
of
a
minister
wrote
the
letter
himself
to
himself
got
it
smuggled
out
of
the
prison
got
it
conveyed
to
persons
who
had
supported
and
encouraged
him
in
his
conversion
where
he
knew
two
things
would
happen
the
genuineness
of
the
letter
would
not
be
doubted
or
inquired
into
and
the
nub
of
it
would
be
noticed
and
would
have
valuable
effect
the
effect
indeed
of
starting
a
movement
to
get
mr
williams
pardoned
out
of
prison
that
nub
is
so
ingeniously
so
casually
flung
in
and
immediately
left
there
in
the
tail
of
the
letter
undwelt
upon
that
an
indifferent
reader
would
never
suspect
that
it
was
the
heart
and
core
of
the
epistle
if
he
even
took
note
of
it
at
all
this
is
the
nub
i
hope
the
warm
weather
is
doing
your
lungs
good
i
was
afraid
when
you
was
bleeding
you
would
die
give
my
respects
etc
that
is
all
there
is
of
it
simply
touch
and
go
no
dwelling
upon
it
nevertheless
it
was
intended
for
an
eye
that
would
be
swift
to
see
it
and
it
was
meant
to
move
a
kind
heart
to
try
to
effect
the
liberation
of
a
poor
reformed
and
purified
fellow
lying
in
the
fell
grip
of
consumption
when
i
for
the
first
time
heard
that
letter
read
nine
years
ago
i
felt
that
it
was
the
most
remarkable
one
i
had
ever
encountered
and
it
so
warmed
me
toward
mr
brown
of
st
louis
that
i
said
that
if
ever
i
visited
that
city
again
i
would
seek
out
that
excellent
man
and
kiss
the
hem
of
his
garment
if
it
was
a
new
one
well
i
visited
st
louis
but
i
did
not
hunt
for
mr
brown
for
alas
the
investigations
of
long
ago
had
proved
that
the
benevolent
brown
like
jack
hunt
was
not
a
real
person
but
a
sheer
invention
of
that
gifted
rascal
williams
burglar
harvard
graduate
son
of
a
clergyman
chapter
my
boyhood's
home
we
took
passage
in
one
of
the
fast
boats
of
the
st
louis
and
st
paul
packet
company
and
started
up
the
river
when
i
as
a
boy
first
saw
the
mouth
of
the
missouri
river
it
was
twenty
two
or
twenty
three
miles
above
st
louis
according
to
the
estimate
of
pilots
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
banks
have
moved
it
down
eight
miles
since
then
and
the
pilots
say
that
within
five
years
the
river
will
cut
through
and
move
the
mouth
down
five
miles
more
which
will
bring
it
within
ten
miles
of
st
louis
about
nightfall
we
passed
the
large
and
flourishing
town
of
alton
illinois
and
before
daylight
next
morning
the
town
of
louisiana
missouri
a
sleepy
village
in
my
day
but
a
brisk
railway
center
now
however
all
the
towns
out
there
are
railway
centers
now
i
could
not
clearly
recognize
the
place
this
seemed
odd
to
me
for
when
i
retired
from
the
rebel
army
in
i
retired
upon
louisiana
in
good
order
at
least
in
good
enough
order
for
a
person
who
had
not
yet
learned
how
to
retreat
according
to
the
rules
of
war
and
had
to
trust
to
native
genius
it
seemed
to
me
that
for
a
first
attempt
at
a
retreat
it
was
not
badly
done
i
had
done
no
advancing
in
all
that
campaign
that
was
at
all
equal
to
it
there
was
a
railway
bridge
across
the
river
here
well
sprinkled
with
glowing
lights
and
a
very
beautiful
sight
it
was
at
seven
in
the
morning
we
reached
hannibal
missouri
where
my
boyhood
was
spent
i
had
had
a
glimpse
of
it
fifteen
years
ago
and
another
glimpse
six
years
earlier
but
both
were
so
brief
that
they
hardly
counted
the
only
notion
of
the
town
that
remained
in
my
mind
was
the
memory
of
it
as
i
had
known
it
when
i
first
quitted
it
twenty
nine
years
ago
that
picture
of
it
was
still
as
clear
and
vivid
to
me
as
a
photograph
i
stepped
ashore
with
the
feeling
of
one
who
returns
out
of
a
dead
and
gone
generation
i
had
a
sort
of
realizing
sense
of
what
the
bastille
prisoners
must
have
felt
when
they
used
to
come
out
and
look
upon
paris
after
years
of
captivity
and
note
how
curiously
the
familiar
and
the
strange
were
mixed
together
before
them
i
saw
the
new
houses
saw
them
plainly
enough
but
they
did
not
affect
the
older
picture
in
my
mind
for
through
their
solid
bricks
and
mortar
i
saw
the
vanished
houses
which
had
formerly
stood
there
with
perfect
distinctness
it
was
sunday
morning
and
everybody
was
abed
yet
so
i
passed
through
the
vacant
streets
still
seeing
the
town
as
it
was
and
not
as
it
is
and
recognizing
and
metaphorically
shaking
hands
with
a
hundred
familiar
objects
which
no
longer
exist
and
finally
climbed
holiday's
hill
to
get
a
comprehensive
view
the
whole
town
lay
spread
out
below
me
then
and
i
could
mark
and
fix
every
locality
every
detail
naturally
i
was
a
good
deal
moved
i
said
many
of
the
people
i
once
knew
in
this
tranquil
refuge
of
my
childhood
are
now
in
heaven
some
i
trust
are
in
the
other
place
the
things
about
me
and
before
me
made
me
feel
like
a
boy
again
convinced
me
that
i
was
a
boy
again
and
that
i
had
simply
been
dreaming
an
unusually
long
dream
but
my
reflections
spoiled
all
that
for
they
forced
me
to
say
i
see
fifty
old
houses
down
yonder
into
each
of
which
i
could
enter
and
find
either
a
man
or
a
woman
who
was
a
baby
or
unborn
when
i
noticed
those
houses
last
or
a
grandmother
who
was
a
plump
young
bride
at
that
time
from
this
vantage
ground
the
extensive
view
up
and
down
the
river
and
wide
over
the
wooded
expanses
of
illinois
is
very
beautiful
one
of
the
most
beautiful
on
the
mississippi
i
think
which
is
a
hazardous
remark
to
make
for
the
eight
hundred
miles
of
river
between
st
louis
and
st
paul
afford
an
unbroken
succession
of
lovely
pictures
it
may
be
that
my
affection
for
the
one
in
question
biases
my
judgment
in
its
favor
i
cannot
say
as
to
that
no
matter
it
was
satisfyingly
beautiful
to
me
and
it
had
this
advantage
over
all
the
other
friends
whom
i
was
about
to
greet
again
it
had
suffered
no
change
it
was
as
young
and
fresh
and
comely
and
gracious
as
ever
it
had
been
whereas
the
faces
of
the
others
would
be
old
and
scarred
with
the
campaigns
of
life
and
marked
with
their
griefs
and
defeats
and
would
give
me
no
upliftings
of
spirit
an
old
gentleman
out
on
an
early
morning
walk
came
along
and
we
discussed
the
weather
and
then
drifted
into
other
matters
i
could
not
remember
his
face
he
said
he
had
been
living
here
twenty
eight
years
so
he
had
come
after
my
time
and
i
had
never
seen
him
before
i
asked
him
various
questions
first
about
a
mate
of
mine
in
sunday
school
what
became
of
him
he
graduated
with
honor
in
an
eastern
college
wandered
off
into
the
world
somewhere
succeeded
at
nothing
passed
out
of
knowledge
and
memory
years
ago
and
is
supposed
to
have
gone
to
the
dogs
he
was
bright
and
promised
well
when
he
was
a
boy
yes
but
the
thing
that
happened
is
what
became
of
it
all
i
asked
after
another
lad
altogether
the
brightest
in
our
village
school
when
i
was
a
boy
he
too
was
graduated
with
honors
from
an
eastern
college
but
life
whipped
him
in
every
battle
straight
along
and
he
died
in
one
of
the
territories
years
ago
a
defeated
man
i
asked
after
another
of
the
bright
boys
he
is
a
success
always
has
been
always
will
be
i
think
i
inquired
after
a
young
fellow
who
came
to
the
town
to
study
for
one
of
the
professions
when
i
was
a
boy
he
went
at
something
else
before
he
got
through
went
from
medicine
to
law
or
from
law
to
medicine
then
to
some
other
new
thing
went
away
for
a
year
came
back
with
a
young
wife
fell
to
drinking
then
to
gambling
behind
the
door
finally
took
his
wife
and
two
young
children
to
her
father's
and
went
off
to
mexico
went
from
bad
to
worse
and
finally
died
there
without
a
cent
to
buy
a
shroud
and
without
a
friend
to
attend
the
funeral
pity
for
he
was
the
best
natured
and
most
cheery
and
hopeful
young
fellow
that
ever
was
i
named
another
boy
oh
he
is
all
right
lives
here
yet
has
a
wife
and
children
and
is
prospering
same
verdict
concerning
other
boys
i
named
three
school
girls
the
first
two
live
here
are
married
and
have
children
the
other
is
long
ago
dead
never
married
i
named
with
emotion
one
of
my
early
sweethearts
she
is
all
right
been
married
three
times
buried
two
husbands
divorced
from
the
third
and
i
hear
she
is
getting
ready
to
marry
an
old
fellow
out
in
colorado
somewhere
she's
got
children
scattered
around
here
and
there
most
everywheres
the
answer
to
several
other
inquiries
was
brief
and
simple
killed
in
the
war
i
named
another
boy
well
now
his
case
is
curious
there
wasn't
a
human
being
in
this
town
but
knew
that
that
boy
was
a
perfect
chucklehead
perfect
dummy
just
a
stupid
ass
as
you
may
say
everybody
knew
it
and
everybody
said
it
well
if
that
very
boy
isn't
the
first
lawyer
in
the
state
of
missouri
to
day
i'm
a
democrat
is
that
so
it's
actually
so
i'm
telling
you
the
truth
how
do
you
account
for
it
account
for
it
there
ain't
any
accounting
for
it
except
that
if
you
send
a
damned
fool
to
st
louis
and
you
don't
tell
them
he's
a
damned
fool
they'll
never
find
it
out
there's
one
thing
sure
if
i
had
a
damned
fool
i
should
know
what
to
do
with
him
ship
him
to
st
louis
it's
the
noblest
market
in
the
world
for
that
kind
of
property
well
when
you
come
to
look
at
it
all
around
and
chew
at
it
and
think
it
over
don't
it
just
bang
anything
you
ever
heard
of
well
yes
it
does
seem
to
but
don't
you
think
maybe
it
was
the
hannibal
people
who
were
mistaken
about
the
boy
and
not
the
st
louis
people
oh
nonsense
the
people
here
have
known
him
from
the
very
cradle
they
knew
him
a
hundred
times
better
than
the
st
louis
idiots
could
have
known
him
no
if
you
have
got
any
damned
fools
that
you
want
to
realize
on
take
my
advice
send
them
to
st
louis
i
mentioned
a
great
number
of
people
whom
i
had
formerly
known
some
were
dead
some
were
gone
away
some
had
prospered
some
had
come
to
naught
but
as
regarded
a
dozen
or
so
of
the
lot
the
answer
was
comforting
prosperous
live
here
yet
town
littered
with
their
children
i
asked
about
miss
died
in
the
insane
asylum
three
or
four
years
ago
never
was
out
of
it
from
the
time
she
went
in
and
was
always
suffering
too
never
got
a
shred
of
her
mind
back
if
he
spoke
the
truth
here
was
a
heavy
tragedy
indeed
thirty
six
years
in
a
madhouse
that
some
young
fools
might
have
some
fun
i
was
a
small
boy
at
the
time
and
i
saw
those
giddy
young
ladies
come
tiptoeing
into
the
room
where
miss
sat
reading
at
midnight
by
a
lamp
the
girl
at
the
head
of
the
file
wore
a
shroud
and
a
doughface
she
crept
behind
the
victim
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
and
she
looked
up
and
screamed
and
then
fell
into
convulsions
she
did
not
recover
from
the
fright
but
went
mad
in
these
days
it
seems
incredible
that
people
believed
in
ghosts
so
short
a
time
ago
but
they
did
after
asking
after
such
other
folk
as
i
could
call
to
mind
i
finally
inquired
about
myself
oh
he
succeeded
well
enough
another
case
of
damned
fool
if
they'd
sent
him
to
st
louis
he'd
have
succeeded
sooner
it
was
with
much
satisfaction
that
i
recognized
the
wisdom
of
having
told
this
candid
gentleman
in
the
beginning
that
my
name
was
smith
chapter
past
and
present
being
left
to
myself
up
there
i
went
on
picking
out
old
houses
in
the
distant
town
and
calling
back
their
former
inmates
out
of
the
moldy
past
among
them
i
presently
recognized
the
house
of
the
father
of
lem
hackett
fictitious
name
it
carried
me
back
more
than
a
generation
in
a
moment
and
landed
me
in
the
midst
of
a
time
when
the
happenings
of
life
were
not
the
natural
and
logical
results
of
great
general
laws
but
of
special
orders
and
were
freighted
with
very
precise
and
distinct
purposes
partly
punitive
in
intent
partly
admonitory
and
usually
local
in
application
when
i
was
a
small
boy
lem
hackett
was
drowned
on
a
sunday
he
fell
out
of
an
empty
flat
boat
where
he
was
playing
being
loaded
with
sin
he
went
to
the
bottom
like
an
anvil
he
was
the
only
boy
in
the
village
who
slept
that
night
we
others
all
lay
awake
repenting
we
had
not
needed
the
information
delivered
from
the
pulpit
that
evening
that
lem's
was
a
case
of
special
judgment
we
knew
that
already
there
was
a
ferocious
thunder
storm
that
night
and
it
raged
continuously
until
near
dawn
the
winds
blew
the
windows
rattled
the
rain
swept
along
the
roof
in
pelting
sheets
and
at
the
briefest
of
intervals
the
inky
blackness
of
the
night
vanished
the
houses
over
the
way
glared
out
white
and
blinding
for
a
quivering
instant
then
the
solid
darkness
shut
down
again
and
a
splitting
peal
of
thunder
followed
which
seemed
to
rend
everything
in
the
neighborhood
to
shreds
and
splinters
i
sat
up
in
bed
quaking
and
shuddering
waiting
for
the
destruction
of
the
world
and
expecting
it
to
me
there
was
nothing
strange
or
incongruous
in
heaven's
making
such
an
uproar
about
lem
hackett
apparently
it
was
the
right
and
proper
thing
to
do
not
a
doubt
entered
my
mind
that
all
the
angels
were
grouped
together
discussing
this
boy's
case
and
observing
the
awful
bombardment
of
our
beggarly
little
village
with
satisfaction
and
approval
there
was
one
thing
which
disturbed
me
in
the
most
serious
way
that
was
the
thought
that
this
centering
of
the
celestial
interest
on
our
village
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
observers
to
people
among
us
who
might
otherwise
have
escaped
notice
for
years
i
felt
that
i
was
not
only
one
of
those
people
but
the
very
one
most
likely
to
be
discovered
that
discovery
could
have
but
one
result
i
should
be
in
the
fire
with
lem
before
the
chill
of
the
river
had
been
fairly
warmed
out
of
him
i
knew
that
this
would
be
only
just
and
fair
i
was
increasing
the
chances
against
myself
all
the
time
by
feeling
a
secret
bitterness
against
lem
for
having
attracted
this
fatal
attention
to
me
but
i
could
not
help
it
this
sinful
thought
persisted
in
infesting
my
breast
in
spite
of
me
every
time
the
lightning
glared
i
caught
my
breath
and
judged
i
was
gone
in
my
terror
and
misery
i
meanly
began
to
suggest
other
boys
and
mention
acts
of
theirs
which
were
wickeder
than
mine
and
peculiarly
needed
punishment
and
i
tried
to
pretend
to
myself
that
i
was
simply
doing
this
in
a
casual
way
and
without
intent
to
divert
the
heavenly
attention
to
them
for
the
purpose
of
getting
rid
of
it
myself
with
deep
sagacity
i
put
these
mentions
into
the
form
of
sorrowing
recollections
and
left
handed
sham
supplications
that
the
sins
of
those
boys
might
be
allowed
to
pass
unnoticed
possibly
they
may
repent
it
is
true
that
jim
smith
broke
a
window
and
lied
about
it
but
maybe
he
did
not
mean
any
harm
and
although
tom
holmes
says
more
bad
words
than
any
other
boy
in
the
village
he
probably
intends
to
repent
though
he
has
never
said
he
would
and
whilst
it
is
a
fact
that
john
jones
did
fish
a
little
on
sunday
once
he
didn't
really
catch
anything
but
only
just
one
small
useless
mud
cat
and
maybe
that
wouldn't
have
been
so
awful
if
he
had
thrown
it
back
as
he
says
he
did
but
he
didn't
pity
but
they
would
repent
of
these
dreadful
things
and
maybe
they
will
yet
but
while
i
was
shamefully
trying
to
draw
attention
to
these
poor
chaps
who
were
doubtless
directing
the
celestial
attention
to
me
at
the
same
moment
though
i
never
once
suspected
that
i
had
heedlessly
left
my
candle
burning
it
was
not
a
time
to
neglect
even
trifling
precautions
there
was
no
occasion
to
add
anything
to
the
facilities
for
attracting
notice
to
me
so
i
put
the
light
out
it
was
a
long
night
to
me
and
perhaps
the
most
distressful
one
i
ever
spent
i
endured
agonies
of
remorse
for
sins
which
i
knew
i
had
committed
and
for
others
which
i
was
not
certain
about
yet
was
sure
that
they
had
been
set
down
against
me
in
a
book
by
an
angel
who
was
wiser
than
i
and
did
not
trust
such
important
matters
to
memory
it
struck
me
by
and
by
that
i
had
been
making
a
most
foolish
and
calamitous
mistake
in
one
respect
doubtless
i
had
not
only
made
my
own
destruction
sure
by
directing
attention
to
those
other
boys
but
had
already
accomplished
theirs
doubtless
the
lightning
had
stretched
them
all
dead
in
their
beds
by
this
time
the
anguish
and
the
fright
which
this
thought
gave
me
made
my
previous
sufferings
seem
trifling
by
comparison
things
had
become
truly
serious
i
resolved
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
instantly
i
also
resolved
to
connect
myself
with
the
church
the
next
day
if
i
survived
to
see
its
sun
appear
i
resolved
to
cease
from
sin
in
all
its
forms
and
to
lead
a
high
and
blameless
life
for
ever
after
i
would
be
punctual
at
church
and
sunday
school
visit
the
sick
carry
baskets
of
victuals
to
the
poor
simply
to
fulfil
the
regulation
conditions
although
i
knew
we
had
none
among
us
so
poor
but
they
would
smash
the
basket
over
my
head
for
my
pains
i
would
instruct
other
boys
in
right
ways
and
take
the
resulting
trouncings
meekly
i
would
subsist
entirely
on
tracts
i
would
invade
the
rum
shop
and
warn
the
drunkard
and
finally
if
i
escaped
the
fate
of
those
who
early
become
too
good
to
live
i
would
go
for
a
missionary
the
storm
subsided
toward
daybreak
and
i
dozed
gradually
to
sleep
with
a
sense
of
obligation
to
lem
hackett
for
going
to
eternal
suffering
in
that
abrupt
way
and
thus
preventing
a
far
more
dreadful
disaster
my
own
loss
but
when
i
rose
refreshed
by
and
by
and
found
that
those
other
boys
were
still
alive
i
had
a
dim
sense
that
perhaps
the
whole
thing
was
a
false
alarm
that
the
entire
turmoil
had
been
on
lem's
account
and
nobody's
else
the
world
looked
so
bright
and
safe
that
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
real
occasion
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
i
was
a
little
subdued
during
that
day
and
perhaps
the
next
after
that
my
purpose
of
reforming
slowly
dropped
out
of
my
mind
and
i
had
a
peaceful
comfortable
time
again
until
the
next
storm
that
storm
came
about
three
weeks
later
and
it
was
the
most
unaccountable
one
to
me
that
i
had
ever
experienced
for
on
the
afternoon
of
that
day
dutchy
was
drowned
dutchy
belonged
to
our
sunday
school
he
was
a
german
lad
who
did
not
know
enough
to
come
in
out
of
the
rain
but
he
was
exasperatingly
good
and
had
a
prodigious
memory
one
sunday
he
made
himself
the
envy
of
all
the
youth
and
the
talk
of
all
the
admiring
village
by
reciting
three
thousand
verses
of
scripture
without
missing
a
word
then
he
went
off
the
very
next
day
and
got
drowned
circumstances
gave
to
his
death
a
peculiar
impressiveness
we
were
all
bathing
in
a
muddy
creek
which
had
a
deep
hole
in
it
and
in
this
hole
the
coopers
had
sunk
a
pile
of
green
hickory
hoop
poles
to
soak
some
twelve
feet
under
water
we
were
diving
and
seeing
who
could
stay
under
longest
we
managed
to
remain
down
by
holding
on
to
the
hoop
poles
dutchy
made
such
a
poor
success
of
it
that
he
was
hailed
with
laughter
and
derision
every
time
his
head
appeared
above
water
at
last
he
seemed
hurt
with
the
taunts
and
begged
us
to
stand
still
on
the
bank
and
be
fair
with
him
and
give
him
an
honest
count
be
friendly
and
kind
just
this
once
and
not
miscount
for
the
sake
of
having
the
fun
of
laughing
at
him
treacherous
winks
were
exchanged
and
all
said
all
right
dutchy
go
ahead
we'll
play
fair
dutchy
plunged
in
but
the
boys
instead
of
beginning
to
count
followed
the
lead
of
one
of
their
number
and
scampered
to
a
range
of
blackberry
bushes
close
by
and
hid
behind
it
they
imagined
dutchy's
humiliation
when
he
should
rise
after
a
superhuman
effort
and
find
the
place
silent
and
vacant
nobody
there
to
applaud
they
were
so
full
of
laugh
with
the
idea
that
they
were
continually
exploding
into
muffled
cackles
time
swept
on
and
presently
one
who
was
peeping
through
the
briers
said
with
surprise
why
he
hasn't
come
up
yet
the
laughing
stopped
boys
it
s
a
splendid
dive
said
one
never
mind
that
said
another
the
joke
on
him
is
all
the
better
for
it
there
was
a
remark
or
two
more
and
then
a
pause
talking
ceased
and
all
began
to
peer
through
the
vines
before
long
the
boys
faces
began
to
look
uneasy
then
anxious
then
terrified
still
there
was
no
movement
of
the
placid
water
hearts
began
to
beat
fast
and
faces
to
turn
pale
we
all
glided
out
silently
and
stood
on
the
bank
our
horrified
eyes
wandering
back
and
forth
from
each
other's
countenances
to
the
water
somebody
must
go
down
and
see
yes
that
was
plain
but
nobody
wanted
that
grisly
task
draw
straws
so
we
did
with
hands
which
shook
so
that
we
hardly
knew
what
we
were
about
the
lot
fell
to
me
and
i
went
down
the
water
was
so
muddy
i
could
not
see
anything
but
i
felt
around
among
the
hoop
poles
and
presently
grasped
a
limp
wrist
which
gave
me
no
response
and
if
it
had
i
should
not
have
known
it
i
let
it
go
with
such
a
frightened
suddenness
the
boy
had
been
caught
among
the
hoop
poles
and
entangled
there
helplessly
i
fled
to
the
surface
and
told
the
awful
news
some
of
us
knew
that
if
the
boy
were
dragged
out
at
once
he
might
possibly
be
resuscitated
but
we
never
thought
of
that
we
did
not
think
of
anything
we
did
not
know
what
to
do
so
we
did
nothing
except
that
the
smaller
lads
cried
piteously
and
we
all
struggled
frantically
into
our
clothes
putting
on
anybody's
that
came
handy
and
getting
them
wrong
side
out
and
upside
down
as
a
rule
then
we
scurried
away
and
gave
the
alarm
but
none
of
us
went
back
to
see
the
end
of
the
tragedy
we
had
a
more
important
thing
to
attend
to
we
all
flew
home
and
lost
not
a
moment
in
getting
ready
to
lead
a
better
life
the
night
presently
closed
down
then
came
on
that
tremendous
and
utterly
unaccountable
storm
i
was
perfectly
dazed
i
could
not
understand
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
must
be
some
mistake
the
elements
were
turned
loose
and
they
rattled
and
banged
and
blazed
away
in
the
most
blind
and
frantic
manner
all
heart
and
hope
went
out
of
me
and
the
dismal
thought
kept
floating
through
my
brain
if
a
boy
who
knows
three
thousand
verses
by
heart
is
not
satisfactory
what
chance
is
there
for
anybody
else
of
course
i
never
questioned
for
a
moment
that
the
storm
was
on
dutchy's
account
or
that
he
or
any
other
inconsequential
animal
was
worthy
of
such
a
majestic
demonstration
from
on
high
the
lesson
of
it
was
the
only
thing
that
troubled
me
for
it
convinced
me
that
if
dutchy
with
all
his
perfections
was
not
a
delight
it
would
be
vain
for
me
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
for
i
must
infallibly
fall
hopelessly
short
of
that
boy
no
matter
how
hard
i
might
try
nevertheless
i
did
turn
it
over
a
highly
educated
fear
compelled
me
to
do
that
but
succeeding
days
of
cheerfulness
and
sunshine
came
bothering
around
and
within
a
month
i
had
so
drifted
backward
that
again
i
was
as
lost
and
comfortable
as
ever
breakfast
time
approached
while
i
mused
these
musings
and
called
these
ancient
happenings
back
to
mind
so
i
got
me
back
into
the
present
and
went
down
the
hill
on
my
way
through
town
to
the
hotel
i
saw
the
house
which
was
my
home
when
i
was
a
boy
at
present
rates
the
people
who
now
occupy
it
are
of
no
more
value
than
i
am
but
in
my
time
they
would
have
been
worth
not
less
than
five
hundred
dollars
apiece
they
are
colored
folk
after
breakfast
i
went
out
alone
again
intending
to
hunt
up
some
of
the
sunday
schools
and
see
how
this
generation
of
pupils
might
compare
with
their
progenitors
who
had
sat
with
me
in
those
places
and
had
probably
taken
me
as
a
model
though
i
do
not
remember
as
to
that
now
by
the
public
square
there
had
been
in
my
day
a
shabby
little
brick
church
called
the
old
ship
of
zion
which
i
had
attended
as
a
sunday
school
scholar
and
i
found
the
locality
easily
enough
but
not
the
old
church
it
was
gone
and
a
trig
and
rather
hilarious
new
edifice
was
in
its
place
the
pupils
were
better
dressed
and
better
looking
than
were
those
of
my
time
consequently
they
did
not
resemble
their
ancestors
and
consequently
there
was
nothing
familiar
to
me
in
their
faces
still
i
contemplated
them
with
a
deep
interest
and
a
yearning
wistfulness
and
if
i
had
been
a
girl
i
would
have
cried
for
they
were
the
offspring
and
represented
and
occupied
the
places
of
boys
and
girls
some
of
whom
i
had
loved
to
love
and
some
of
whom
i
had
loved
to
hate
but
all
of
whom
were
dear
to
me
for
the
one
reason
or
the
other
so
many
years
gone
by
and
lord
where
be
they
now
i
was
mightily
stirred
and
would
have
been
grateful
to
be
allowed
to
remain
unmolested
and
look
my
fill
but
a
bald
summited
superintendent
who
had
been
a
tow
headed
sunday
school
mate
of
mine
on
that
spot
in
the
early
ages
recognized
me
and
i
talked
a
flutter
of
wild
nonsense
to
those
children
to
hide
the
thoughts
which
were
in
me
and
which
could
not
have
been
spoken
without
a
betrayal
of
feeling
that
would
have
been
recognized
as
out
of
character
with
me
making
speeches
without
preparation
is
no
gift
of
mine
and
i
was
resolved
to
shirk
any
new
opportunity
but
in
the
next
and
larger
sunday
school
i
found
myself
in
the
rear
of
the
assemblage
so
i
was
very
willing
to
go
on
the
platform
a
moment
for
the
sake
of
getting
a
good
look
at
the
scholars
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
could
not
recall
any
of
the
old
idiotic
talks
which
visitors
used
to
insult
me
with
when
i
was
a
pupil
there
and
i
was
sorry
for
this
since
it
would
have
given
me
time
and
excuse
to
dawdle
there
and
take
a
long
and
satisfying
look
at
what
i
feel
at
liberty
to
say
was
an
array
of
fresh
young
comeliness
not
matchable
in
another
sunday
school
of
the
same
size
as
i
talked
merely
to
get
a
chance
to
inspect
and
as
i
strung
out
the
random
rubbish
solely
to
prolong
the
inspection
i
judged
it
but
decent
to
confess
these
low
motives
and
i
did
so
if
the
model
boy
was
in
either
of
these
sunday
schools
i
did
not
see
him
the
model
boy
of
my
time
we
never
had
but
the
one
was
perfect
perfect
in
manners
perfect
in
dress
perfect
in
conduct
perfect
in
filial
piety
perfect
in
exterior
godliness
but
at
bottom
he
was
a
prig
and
as
for
the
contents
of
his
skull
they
could
have
changed
place
with
the
contents
of
a
pie
and
nobody
would
have
been
the
worse
off
for
it
but
the
pie
this
fellow's
reproachlessness
was
a
standing
reproach
to
every
lad
in
the
village
he
was
the
admiration
of
all
the
mothers
and
the
detestation
of
all
their
sons
i
was
told
what
became
of
him
but
as
it
was
a
disappointment
to
me
i
will
not
enter
into
details
he
succeeded
in
life
chapter
a
vendetta
and
other
things
during
my
three
days
stay
in
the
town
i
woke
up
every
morning
with
the
impression
that
i
was
a
boy
for
in
my
dreams
the
faces
were
all
young
again
and
looked
as
they
had
looked
in
the
old
times
but
i
went
to
bed
a
hundred
years
old
every
night
for
meantime
i
had
been
seeing
those
faces
as
they
are
now
of
course
i
suffered
some
surprises
along
at
first
before
i
had
become
adjusted
to
the
changed
state
of
things
i
met
young
ladies
who
did
not
seem
to
have
changed
at
all
but
they
turned
out
to
be
the
daughters
of
the
young
ladies
i
had
in
mind
sometimes
their
grand
daughters
when
you
are
told
that
a
stranger
of
fifty
is
a
grandmother
there
is
nothing
surprising
about
it
but
if
on
the
contrary
she
is
a
person
whom
you
knew
as
a
little
girl
it
seems
impossible
you
say
to
yourself
how
can
a
little
girl
be
a
grandmother
it
takes
some
little
time
to
accept
and
realize
the
fact
that
while
you
have
been
growing
old
your
friends
have
not
been
standing
still
in
that
matter
i
noticed
that
the
greatest
changes
observable
were
with
the
women
not
the
men
i
saw
men
whom
thirty
years
had
changed
but
slightly
but
their
wives
had
grown
old
these
were
good
women
it
is
very
wearing
to
be
good
there
was
a
saddler
whom
i
wished
to
see
but
he
was
gone
dead
these
many
years
they
said
once
or
twice
a
day
the
saddler
used
to
go
tearing
down
the
street
putting
on
his
coat
as
he
went
and
then
everybody
knew
a
steamboat
was
coming
everybody
knew
also
that
john
stavely
was
not
expecting
anybody
by
the
boat
or
any
freight
either
and
stavely
must
have
known
that
everybody
knew
this
still
it
made
no
difference
to
him
he
liked
to
seem
to
himself
to
be
expecting
a
hundred
thousand
tons
of
saddles
by
this
boat
and
so
he
went
on
all
his
life
enjoying
being
faithfully
on
hand
to
receive
and
receipt
for
those
saddles
in
case
by
any
miracle
they
should
come
a
malicious
quincy
paper
used
always
to
refer
to
this
town
in
derision
as
stavely's
landing
stavely
was
one
of
my
earliest
admirations
i
envied
him
his
rush
of
imaginary
business
and
the
display
he
was
able
to
make
of
it
before
strangers
as
he
went
flying
down
the
street
struggling
with
his
fluttering
coat
but
there
was
a
carpenter
who
was
my
chiefest
hero
he
was
a
mighty
liar
but
i
did
not
know
that
i
believed
everything
he
said
he
was
a
romantic
sentimental
melodramatic
fraud
and
his
bearing
impressed
me
with
awe
i
vividly
remember
the
first
time
he
took
me
into
his
confidence
he
was
planing
a
board
and
every
now
and
then
he
would
pause
and
heave
a
deep
sigh
and
occasionally
mutter
broken
sentences
confused
and
not
intelligible
but
out
of
their
midst
an
ejaculation
sometimes
escaped
which
made
me
shiver
and
did
me
good
one
was
o
god
it
is
his
blood
i
sat
on
the
tool
chest
and
humbly
and
shudderingly
admired
him
for
i
judged
he
was
full
of
crime
at
last
he
said
in
a
low
voice
my
little
friend
can
you
keep
a
secret
i
eagerly
said
i
could
a
dark
and
dreadful
one
i
satisfied
him
on
that
point
then
i
will
tell
you
some
passages
in
my
history
for
oh
i
must
relieve
my
burdened
soul
or
i
shall
die
he
cautioned
me
once
more
to
be
as
silent
as
the
grave
then
he
told
me
he
was
a
red
handed
murderer
he
put
down
his
plane
held
his
hands
out
before
him
contemplated
them
sadly
and
said
look
with
these
hands
i
have
taken
the
lives
of
thirty
human
beings
the
effect
which
this
had
upon
me
was
an
inspiration
to
him
and
he
turned
himself
loose
upon
his
subject
with
interest
and
energy
he
left
generalizing
and
went
into
details
began
with
his
first
murder
described
it
told
what
measures
he
had
taken
to
avert
suspicion
then
passed
to
his
second
homicide
his
third
his
fourth
and
so
on
he
had
always
done
his
murders
with
a
bowie
knife
and
he
made
all
my
hairs
rise
by
suddenly
snatching
it
out
and
showing
it
to
me
at
the
end
of
this
first
seance
i
went
home
with
six
of
his
fearful
secrets
among
my
freightage
and
found
them
a
great
help
to
my
dreams
which
had
been
sluggish
for
a
while
back
i
sought
him
again
and
again
on
my
saturday
holidays
in
fact
i
spent
the
summer
with
him
all
of
it
which
was
valuable
to
me
his
fascinations
never
diminished
for
he
threw
something
fresh
and
stirring
in
the
way
of
horror
into
each
successive
murder
he
always
gave
names
dates
places
everything
this
by
and
by
enabled
me
to
note
two
things
that
he
had
killed
his
victims
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
and
that
these
victims
were
always
named
lynch
the
destruction
of
the
lynches
went
serenely
on
saturday
after
saturday
until
the
original
thirty
had
multiplied
to
sixty
and
more
to
be
heard
from
yet
then
my
curiosity
got
the
better
of
my
timidity
and
i
asked
how
it
happened
that
these
justly
punished
persons
all
bore
the
same
name
my
hero
said
he
had
never
divulged
that
dark
secret
to
any
living
being
but
felt
that
he
could
trust
me
and
therefore
he
would
lay
bare
before
me
the
story
of
his
sad
and
blighted
life
he
had
loved
one
too
fair
for
earth
and
she
had
reciprocated
with
all
the
sweet
affection
of
her
pure
and
noble
nature
but
he
had
a
rival
a
base
hireling
named
archibald
lynch
who
said
the
girl
should
be
his
or
he
would
dye
his
hands
in
her
heart's
best
blood
the
carpenter
innocent
and
happy
in
love's
young
dream
gave
no
weight
to
the
threat
but
led
his
golden
haired
darling
to
the
altar
and
there
the
two
were
made
one
there
also
just
as
the
minister's
hands
were
stretched
in
blessing
over
their
heads
the
fell
deed
was
done
with
a
knife
and
the
bride
fell
a
corpse
at
her
husband's
feet
and
what
did
the
husband
do
he
plucked
forth
that
knife
and
kneeling
by
the
body
of
his
lost
one
swore
to
consecrate
his
life
to
the
extermination
of
all
the
human
scum
that
bear
the
hated
name
of
lynch
that
was
it
he
had
been
hunting
down
the
lynches
and
slaughtering
them
from
that
day
to
this
twenty
years
he
had
always
used
that
same
consecrated
knife
with
it
he
had
murdered
his
long
array
of
lynches
and
with
it
he
had
left
upon
the
forehead
of
each
victim
a
peculiar
mark
a
cross
deeply
incised
said
he
the
cross
of
the
mysterious
avenger
is
known
in
europe
in
america
in
china
in
siam
in
the
tropics
in
the
polar
seas
in
the
deserts
of
asia
in
all
the
earth
wherever
in
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
globe
a
lynch
has
penetrated
there
has
the
mysterious
cross
been
seen
and
those
who
have
seen
it
have
shuddered
and
said
it
is
his
mark
he
has
been
here
you
have
heard
of
the
mysterious
avenger
look
upon
him
for
before
you
stands
no
less
a
person
but
beware
breathe
not
a
word
to
any
soul
be
silent
and
wait
some
morning
this
town
will
flock
aghast
to
view
a
gory
corpse
on
its
brow
will
be
seen
the
awful
sign
and
men
will
tremble
and
whisper
he
has
been
here
it
is
the
mysterious
avenger's
mark
you
will
come
here
but
i
shall
have
vanished
you
will
see
me
no
more
this
ass
had
been
reading
the
jibbenainosay
no
doubt
and
had
had
his
poor
romantic
head
turned
by
it
but
as
i
had
not
yet
seen
the
book
then
i
took
his
inventions
for
truth
and
did
not
suspect
that
he
was
a
plagiarist
however
we
had
a
lynch
living
in
the
town
and
the
more
i
reflected
upon
his
impending
doom
the
more
i
could
not
sleep
it
seemed
my
plain
duty
to
save
him
and
a
still
plainer
and
more
important
duty
to
get
some
sleep
for
myself
so
at
last
i
ventured
to
go
to
mr
lynch
and
tell
him
what
was
about
to
happen
to
him
under
strict
secrecy
i
advised
him
to
fly
and
certainly
expected
him
to
do
it
but
he
laughed
at
me
and
he
did
not
stop
there
he
led
me
down
to
the
carpenter's
shop
gave
the
carpenter
a
jeering
and
scornful
lecture
upon
his
silly
pretensions
slapped
his
face
made
him
get
down
on
his
knees
and
beg
then
went
off
and
left
me
to
contemplate
the
cheap
and
pitiful
ruin
of
what
in
my
eyes
had
so
lately
been
a
majestic
and
incomparable
hero
the
carpenter
blustered
flourished
his
knife
and
doomed
this
lynch
in
his
usual
volcanic
style
the
size
of
his
fateful
words
undiminished
but
it
was
all
wasted
upon
me
he
was
a
hero
to
me
no
longer
but
only
a
poor
foolish
exposed
humbug
i
was
ashamed
of
him
and
ashamed
of
myself
i
took
no
further
interest
in
him
and
never
went
to
his
shop
any
more
he
was
a
heavy
loss
to
me
for
he
was
the
greatest
hero
i
had
ever
known
the
fellow
must
have
had
some
talent
for
some
of
his
imaginary
murders
were
so
vividly
and
dramatically
described
that
i
remember
all
their
details
yet
the
people
of
hannibal
are
not
more
changed
than
is
the
town
it
is
no
longer
a
village
it
is
a
city
with
a
mayor
and
a
council
and
water
works
and
probably
a
debt
it
has
fifteen
thousand
people
is
a
thriving
and
energetic
place
and
is
paved
like
the
rest
of
the
west
and
south
where
a
well
paved
street
and
a
good
sidewalk
are
things
so
seldom
seen
that
one
doubts
them
when
he
does
see
them
the
customary
half
dozen
railways
center
in
hannibal
now
and
there
is
a
new
depot
which
cost
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
in
my
time
the
town
had
no
specialty
and
no
commercial
grandeur
the
daily
packet
usually
landed
a
passenger
and
bought
a
catfish
and
took
away
another
passenger
and
a
hatful
of
freight
but
now
a
huge
commerce
in
lumber
has
grown
up
and
a
large
miscellaneous
commerce
is
one
of
the
results
a
deal
of
money
changes
hands
there
now
bear
creek
so
called
perhaps
because
it
was
always
so
particularly
bare
of
bears
is
hidden
out
of
sight
now
under
islands
and
continents
of
piled
lumber
and
nobody
but
an
expert
can
find
it
i
used
to
get
drowned
in
it
every
summer
regularly
and
be
drained
out
and
inflated
and
set
going
again
by
some
chance
enemy
but
not
enough
of
it
is
unoccupied
now
to
drown
a
person
in
it
was
a
famous
breeder
of
chills
and
fever
in
its
day
i
remember
one
summer
when
everybody
in
town
had
this
disease
at
once
many
chimneys
were
shaken
down
and
all
the
houses
were
so
racked
that
the
town
had
to
be
rebuilt
the
chasm
or
gorge
between
lover's
leap
and
the
hill
west
of
it
is
supposed
by
scientists
to
have
been
caused
by
glacial
action
this
is
a
mistake
there
is
an
interesting
cave
a
mile
or
two
below
hannibal
among
the
bluffs
i
would
have
liked
to
revisit
it
but
had
not
time
in
my
time
the
person
who
then
owned
it
turned
it
into
a
mausoleum
for
his
daughter
aged
fourteen
the
body
of
this
poor
child
was
put
into
a
copper
cylinder
filled
with
alcohol
and
this
was
suspended
in
one
of
the
dismal
avenues
of
the
cave
the
top
of
the
cylinder
was
removable
and
it
was
said
to
be
a
common
thing
for
the
baser
order
of
tourists
to
drag
the
dead
face
into
view
and
examine
it
and
comment
upon
it
chapter
a
question
of
law
the
slaughter
house
is
gone
from
the
mouth
of
bear
creek
and
so
is
the
small
jail
or
calaboose
which
once
stood
in
its
neighborhood
a
citizen
asked
do
you
remember
when
jimmy
finn
the
town
drunkard
was
burned
to
death
in
the
calaboose
observe
now
how
history
becomes
defiled
through
lapse
of
time
and
the
help
of
the
bad
memories
of
men
jimmy
finn
was
not
burned
in
the
calaboose
but
died
a
natural
death
in
a
tan
vat
of
a
combination
of
delirium
tremens
and
spontaneous
combustion
when
i
say
natural
death
i
mean
it
was
a
natural
death
for
jimmy
finn
to
die
the
calaboose
victim
was
not
a
citizen
he
was
a
poor
stranger
a
harmless
whiskey
sodden
tramp
i
know
more
about
his
case
than
anybody
else
i
knew
too
much
of
it
in
that
bygone
day
to
relish
speaking
of
it
that
tramp
was
wandering
about
the
streets
one
chilly
evening
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
begging
for
a
match
he
got
neither
matches
nor
courtesy
on
the
contrary
a
troop
of
bad
little
boys
followed
him
around
and
amused
themselves
with
nagging
and
annoying
him
i
assisted
but
at
last
some
appeal
which
the
wayfarer
made
for
forbearance
accompanying
it
with
a
pathetic
reference
to
his
forlorn
and
friendless
condition
touched
such
sense
of
shame
and
remnant
of
right
feeling
as
were
left
in
me
and
i
went
away
and
got
him
some
matches
and
then
hied
me
home
and
to
bed
heavily
weighted
as
to
conscience
and
unbuoyant
in
spirit
an
hour
or
two
afterward
the
man
was
arrested
and
locked
up
in
the
calaboose
by
the
marshal
large
name
for
a
constable
but
that
was
his
title
at
two
in
the
morning
the
church
bells
rang
for
fire
and
everybody
turned
out
of
course
i
with
the
rest
the
tramp
had
used
his
matches
disastrously
he
had
set
his
straw
bed
on
fire
and
the
oaken
sheathing
of
the
room
had
caught
when
i
reached
the
ground
two
hundred
men
women
and
children
stood
massed
together
transfixed
with
horror
and
staring
at
the
grated
windows
of
the
jail
behind
the
iron
bars
and
tugging
frantically
at
them
and
screaming
for
help
stood
the
tramp
he
seemed
like
a
black
object
set
against
a
sun
so
white
and
intense
was
the
light
at
his
back
that
marshal
could
not
be
found
and
he
had
the
only
key
a
battering
ram
was
quickly
improvised
and
the
thunder
of
its
blows
upon
the
door
had
so
encouraging
a
sound
that
the
spectators
broke
into
wild
cheering
and
believed
the
merciful
battle
won
but
it
was
not
so
the
timbers
were
too
strong
they
did
not
yield
it
was
said
that
the
man's
death
grip
still
held
fast
to
the
bars
after
he
was
dead
and
that
in
this
position
the
fires
wrapped
him
about
and
consumed
him
as
to
this
i
do
not
know
what
was
seen
after
i
recognized
the
face
that
was
pleading
through
the
bars
was
seen
by
others
not
by
me
i
saw
that
face
so
situated
every
night
for
a
long
time
afterward
and
i
believed
myself
as
guilty
of
the
man's
death
as
if
i
had
given
him
the
matches
purposely
that
he
might
burn
himself
up
with
them
i
had
not
a
doubt
that
i
should
be
hanged
if
my
connection
with
this
tragedy
were
found
out
the
happenings
and
the
impressions
of
that
time
are
burnt
into
my
memory
and
the
study
of
them
entertains
me
as
much
now
as
they
themselves
distressed
me
then
if
anybody
spoke
of
that
grisly
matter
i
was
all
ears
in
a
moment
and
alert
to
hear
what
might
be
said
for
i
was
always
dreading
and
expecting
to
find
out
that
i
was
suspected
and
so
fine
and
so
delicate
was
the
perception
of
my
guilty
conscience
that
it
often
detected
suspicion
in
the
most
purposeless
remarks
and
in
looks
gestures
glances
of
the
eye
which
had
no
significance
but
which
sent
me
shivering
away
in
a
panic
of
fright
just
the
same
and
how
sick
it
made
me
when
somebody
dropped
howsoever
carelessly
and
barren
of
intent
the
remark
that
murder
will
out
for
a
boy
of
ten
years
i
was
carrying
a
pretty
weighty
cargo
all
this
time
i
was
blessedly
forgetting
one
thing
the
fact
that
i
was
an
inveterate
talker
in
my
sleep
but
one
night
i
awoke
and
found
my
bed
mate
my
younger
brother
sitting
up
in
bed
and
contemplating
me
by
the
light
of
the
moon
i
said
what
is
the
matter
you
talk
so
much
i
can't
sleep
i
came
to
a
sitting
posture
in
an
instant
with
my
kidneys
in
my
throat
and
my
hair
on
end
what
did
i
say
quick
out
with
it
what
did
i
say
nothing
much
it's
a
lie
you
know
everything
everything
about
what
you
know
well
enough
about
that
about
what
i
don't
know
what
you
are
talking
about
i
think
you
are
sick
or
crazy
or
something
but
anyway
you're
awake
and
i'll
get
to
sleep
while
i've
got
a
chance
he
fell
asleep
and
i
lay
there
in
a
cold
sweat
turning
this
new
terror
over
in
the
whirling
chaos
which
did
duty
as
my
mind
the
burden
of
my
thought
was
how
much
did
i
divulge
how
much
does
he
know
what
a
distress
is
this
uncertainty
but
by
and
by
i
evolved
an
idea
i
would
wake
my
brother
and
probe
him
with
a
supposititious
case
i
shook
him
up
and
said
suppose
a
man
should
come
to
you
drunk
this
is
foolish
i
never
get
drunk
i
don't
mean
you
idiot
i
mean
the
man
suppose
a
man
should
come
to
you
drunk
and
borrow
a
knife
or
a
tomahawk
or
a
pistol
and
you
forgot
to
tell
him
it
was
loaded
and
how
could
you
load
a
tomahawk
i
don't
mean
the
tomahawk
and
i
didn't
say
the
tomahawk
i
said
the
pistol
now
don't
you
keep
breaking
in
that
way
because
this
is
serious
there's
been
a
man
killed
what
in
this
town
yes
in
this
town
well
go
on
i
won't
say
a
single
word
well
then
suppose
you
forgot
to
tell
him
to
be
careful
with
it
because
it
was
loaded
and
he
went
off
and
shot
himself
with
that
pistol
fooling
with
it
you
know
and
probably
doing
it
by
accident
being
drunk
well
would
it
be
murder
no
suicide
no
no
i
don't
mean
his
act
i
mean
yours
would
you
be
a
murderer
for
letting
him
have
that
pistol
after
deep
thought
came
this
answer
well
i
should
think
i
was
guilty
of
something
maybe
murder
yes
probably
murder
but
i
don't
quite
know
this
made
me
very
uncomfortable
however
it
was
not
a
decisive
verdict
i
should
have
to
set
out
the
real
case
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
way
but
i
would
do
it
cautiously
and
keep
a
watch
out
for
suspicious
effects
i
said
i
was
supposing
a
case
but
i
am
coming
to
the
real
one
now
do
you
know
how
the
man
came
to
be
burned
up
in
the
calaboose
no
haven't
you
the
least
idea
not
the
least
wish
you
may
die
in
your
tracks
if
you
have
yes
wish
i
may
die
in
my
tracks
well
the
way
of
it
was
this
the
man
wanted
some
matches
to
light
his
pipe
a
boy
got
him
some
the
man
set
fire
to
the
calaboose
with
those
very
matches
and
burnt
himself
up
is
that
so
yes
it
is
now
is
that
boy
a
murderer
do
you
think
let
me
see
the
man
was
drunk
yes
he
was
drunk
very
drunk
yes
and
the
boy
knew
it
yes
he
knew
it
there
was
a
long
pause
then
came
this
heavy
verdict
if
the
man
was
drunk
and
the
boy
knew
it
the
boy
murdered
that
man
this
is
certain
faint
sickening
sensations
crept
along
all
the
fibers
of
my
body
and
i
seemed
to
know
how
a
person
feels
who
hears
his
death
sentence
pronounced
from
the
bench
i
waited
to
hear
what
my
brother
would
say
next
i
believed
i
knew
what
it
would
be
and
i
was
right
he
said
i
know
the
boy
i
had
nothing
to
say
so
i
said
nothing
i
simply
shuddered
then
he
added
yes
before
you
got
half
through
telling
about
the
thing
i
knew
perfectly
well
who
the
boy
was
it
was
ben
coontz
i
came
out
of
my
collapse
as
one
who
rises
from
the
dead
i
said
with
admiration
why
how
in
the
world
did
you
ever
guess
it
you
told
it
in
your
sleep
i
said
to
myself
how
splendid
that
is
this
is
a
habit
which
must
be
cultivated
my
brother
rattled
innocently
on
when
you
were
talking
in
your
sleep
you
kept
mumbling
something
about
matches
which
i
couldn't
make
anything
out
of
but
just
now
when
you
began
to
tell
me
about
the
man
and
the
calaboose
and
the
matches
i
remembered
that
in
your
sleep
you
mentioned
ben
coontz
two
or
three
times
so
i
put
this
and
that
together
you
see
and
right
away
i
knew
it
was
ben
that
burnt
that
man
up
i
praised
his
sagacity
effusively
presently
he
asked
are
you
going
to
give
him
up
to
the
law
no
i
said
i
believe
that
this
will
be
a
lesson
to
him
i
shall
keep
an
eye
on
him
of
course
for
that
is
but
right
but
if
he
stops
where
he
is
and
reforms
it
shall
never
be
said
that
i
betrayed
him
how
good
you
are
well
i
try
to
be
it
is
all
a
person
can
do
in
a
world
like
this
and
now
my
burden
being
shifted
to
other
shoulders
my
terrors
soon
faded
away
the
day
before
we
left
hannibal
a
curious
thing
fell
under
my
notice
the
surprising
spread
which
longitudinal
time
undergoes
there
i
learned
it
from
one
of
the
most
unostentatious
of
men
the
colored
coachman
of
a
friend
of
mine
who
lives
three
miles
from
town
he
was
to
call
for
me
at
the
park
hotel
at
p
m
and
drive
me
out
but
he
missed
it
considerably
did
not
arrive
till
ten
he
excused
himself
by
saying
de
time
is
mos
an
hour
en
a
half
slower
in
de
country
en
what
it
is
in
de
town
you'll
be
in
plenty
time
boss
sometimes
we
shoves
out
early
for
church
sunday
en
fetches
up
dah
right
plum
in
de
middle
er
de
sermon
diffunce
in
de
time
a
body
can't
make
no
calculations
bout
it
i
had
lost
two
hours
and
a
half
but
i
had
learned
a
fact
worth
four
chapter
an
archangel
from
st
louis
northward
there
are
all
the
enlivening
signs
of
the
presence
of
active
energetic
intelligent
prosperous
practical
nineteenth
century
populations
the
people
don't
dream
they
work
the
happy
result
is
manifest
all
around
in
the
substantial
outside
aspect
of
things
and
the
suggestions
of
wholesome
life
and
comfort
that
everywhere
appear
quincy
is
a
notable
example
a
brisk
handsome
well
ordered
city
and
now
as
formerly
interested
in
art
letters
and
other
high
things
but
marion
city
is
an
exception
marion
city
has
gone
backwards
in
a
most
unaccountable
way
this
metropolis
promised
so
well
that
the
projectors
tacked
city
to
its
name
in
the
very
beginning
with
full
confidence
but
it
was
bad
prophecy
when
i
first
saw
marion
city
thirty
five
years
ago
it
contained
one
street
and
nearly
or
quite
six
houses
it
contains
but
one
house
now
and
this
one
in
a
state
of
ruin
is
getting
ready
to
follow
the
former
five
into
the
river
doubtless
marion
city
was
too
near
to
quincy
it
had
another
disadvantage
it
was
situated
in
a
flat
mud
bottom
below
high
water
mark
whereas
quincy
stands
high
up
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
in
the
beginning
quincy
had
the
aspect
and
ways
of
a
model
new
england
town
and
these
she
has
yet
broad
clean
streets
trim
neat
dwellings
and
lawns
fine
mansions
stately
blocks
of
commercial
buildings
and
there
are
ample
fair
grounds
a
well
kept
park
and
many
attractive
drives
library
reading
rooms
a
couple
of
colleges
some
handsome
and
costly
churches
and
a
grand
court
house
with
grounds
which
occupy
a
square
the
population
of
the
city
is
thirty
thousand
there
are
some
large
factories
here
and
manufacturing
of
many
sorts
is
done
on
a
great
scale
la
grange
and
canton
are
growing
towns
but
i
missed
alexandria
was
told
it
was
under
water
but
would
come
up
to
blow
in
the
summer
keokuk
was
easily
recognizable
i
lived
there
in
an
extraordinary
year
there
in
real
estate
matters
the
boom
was
something
wonderful
everybody
bought
everybody
sold
except
widows
and
preachers
they
always
hold
on
and
when
the
tide
ebbs
they
get
left
anything
in
the
semblance
of
a
town
lot
no
matter
how
situated
was
salable
and
at
a
figure
which
would
still
have
been
high
if
the
ground
had
been
sodded
with
greenbacks
the
town
has
a
population
of
fifteen
thousand
now
and
is
progressing
with
a
healthy
growth
it
was
night
and
we
could
not
see
details
for
which
we
were
sorry
for
keokuk
has
the
reputation
of
being
a
beautiful
city
it
was
a
pleasant
one
to
live
in
long
ago
and
doubtless
has
advanced
not
retrograded
in
that
respect
a
mighty
work
which
was
in
progress
there
in
my
day
is
finished
now
this
is
the
canal
over
the
rapids
it
is
eight
miles
long
three
hundred
feet
wide
and
is
in
no
place
less
than
six
feet
deep
its
masonry
is
of
the
majestic
kind
which
the
war
department
usually
deals
in
and
will
endure
like
a
roman
aqueduct
the
work
cost
four
or
five
millions
after
an
hour
or
two
spent
with
former
friends
we
started
up
the
river
again
keokuk
a
long
time
ago
was
an
occasional
loafing
place
of
that
erratic
genius
henry
clay
dean
i
believe
i
never
saw
him
but
once
but
he
was
much
talked
of
when
i
lived
there
this
is
what
was
said
of
him
he
began
life
poor
and
without
education
but
he
educated
himself
on
the
curbstones
of
keokuk
he
would
sit
down
on
a
curbstone
with
his
book
careless
or
unconscious
of
the
clatter
of
commerce
and
the
tramp
of
the
passing
crowds
and
bury
himself
in
his
studies
by
the
hour
never
changing
his
position
except
to
draw
in
his
knees
now
and
then
to
let
a
dray
pass
unobstructed
and
when
his
book
was
finished
its
contents
however
abstruse
had
been
burnt
into
his
memory
and
were
his
permanent
possession
in
this
way
he
acquired
a
vast
hoard
of
all
sorts
of
learning
and
had
it
pigeon
holed
in
his
head
where
he
could
put
his
intellectual
hand
on
it
whenever
it
was
wanted
his
clothes
differed
in
no
respect
from
a
wharf
rat's
except
that
they
were
raggeder
more
ill
assorted
and
inharmonious
and
therefore
more
extravagantly
picturesque
and
several
layers
dirtier
nobody
could
infer
the
master
mind
in
the
top
of
that
edifice
from
the
edifice
itself
he
was
an
orator
by
nature
in
the
first
place
and
later
by
the
training
of
experience
and
practice
when
he
was
out
on
a
canvass
his
name
was
a
lodestone
which
drew
the
farmers
to
his
stump
from
fifty
miles
around
his
theme
was
always
politics
he
used
no
notes
for
a
volcano
does
not
need
notes
in
a
son
of
keokuk's
late
distinguished
citizen
mr
claggett
gave
me
this
incident
concerning
dean
the
war
feeling
was
running
high
in
keokuk
in
and
a
great
mass
meeting
was
to
be
held
on
a
certain
day
in
the
new
athenaeum
a
distinguished
stranger
was
to
address
the
house
after
the
building
had
been
packed
to
its
utmost
capacity
with
sweltering
folk
of
both
sexes
the
stage
still
remained
vacant
the
distinguished
stranger
had
failed
to
connect
the
crowd
grew
impatient
and
by
and
by
indignant
and
rebellious
about
this
time
a
distressed
manager
discovered
dean
on
a
curb
stone
explained
the
dilemma
to
him
took
his
book
away
from
him
rushed
him
into
the
building
the
back
way
and
told
him
to
make
for
the
stage
and
save
his
country
presently
a
sudden
silence
fell
upon
the
grumbling
audience
and
everybody's
eyes
sought
a
single
point
the
wide
empty
carpetless
stage
a
figure
appeared
there
whose
aspect
was
familiar
to
hardly
a
dozen
persons
present
it
was
the
scarecrow
dean
in
foxy
shoes
down
at
the
heels
socks
of
odd
colors
also
down
damaged
trousers
relics
of
antiquity
and
a
world
too
short
exposing
some
inches
of
naked
ankle
an
unbuttoned
vest
also
too
short
and
exposing
a
zone
of
soiled
and
wrinkled
linen
between
it
and
the
waistband
shirt
bosom
open
long
black
handkerchief
wound
round
and
round
the
neck
like
a
bandage
bob
tailed
blue
coat
reaching
down
to
the
small
of
the
back
with
sleeves
which
left
four
inches
of
forearm
unprotected
small
stiff
brimmed
soldier
cap
hung
on
a
corner
of
the
bump
of
whichever
bump
it
was
this
figure
moved
gravely
out
upon
the
stage
and
with
sedate
and
measured
step
down
to
the
front
where
it
paused
and
dreamily
inspected
the
house
saying
no
word
the
silence
of
surprise
held
its
own
for
a
moment
then
was
broken
by
a
just
audible
ripple
of
merriment
which
swept
the
sea
of
faces
like
the
wash
of
a
wave
the
figure
remained
as
before
thoughtfully
inspecting
another
wave
started
laughter
this
time
it
was
followed
by
another
then
a
third
this
last
one
boisterous
and
now
the
stranger
stepped
back
one
pace
took
off
his
soldier
cap
tossed
it
into
the
wing
and
began
to
speak
with
deliberation
nobody
listening
everybody
laughing
and
whispering
the
speaker
talked
on
unembarrassed
and
presently
delivered
a
shot
which
went
home
and
silence
and
attention
resulted
he
followed
it
quick
and
fast
with
other
telling
things
warmed
to
his
work
and
began
to
pour
his
words
out
instead
of
dripping
them
grew
hotter
and
hotter
and
fell
to
discharging
lightnings
and
thunder
and
now
the
house
began
to
break
into
applause
to
which
the
speaker
gave
no
heed
but
went
hammering
straight
on
unwound
his
black
bandage
and
cast
it
away
still
thundering
presently
discarded
the
bob
tailed
coat
and
flung
it
aside
firing
up
higher
and
higher
all
the
time
finally
flung
the
vest
after
the
coat
and
then
for
an
untimed
period
stood
there
like
another
vesuvius
spouting
smoke
and
flame
lava
and
ashes
raining
pumice
stone
and
cinders
shaking
the
moral
earth
with
intellectual
crash
upon
crash
explosion
upon
explosion
while
the
mad
multitude
stood
upon
their
feet
in
a
solid
body
answering
back
with
a
ceaseless
hurricane
of
cheers
through
a
thrashing
snowstorm
of
waving
handkerchiefs
when
dean
came
said
claggett
the
people
thought
he
was
an
escaped
lunatic
but
when
he
went
they
thought
he
was
an
escaped
archangel
burlington
home
of
the
sparkling
burdette
is
another
hill
city
and
also
a
beautiful
one
unquestionably
so
a
fine
and
flourishing
city
with
a
population
of
twenty
five
thousand
and
belted
with
busy
factories
of
nearly
every
imaginable
description
it
was
a
very
sober
city
too
for
the
moment
for
a
most
sobering
bill
was
pending
a
bill
to
forbid
the
manufacture
exportation
importation
purchase
sale
borrowing
lending
stealing
drinking
smelling
or
possession
by
conquest
inheritance
intent
accident
or
otherwise
in
the
state
of
iowa
of
each
and
every
deleterious
beverage
known
to
the
human
race
except
water
this
measure
was
approved
by
all
the
rational
people
in
the
state
but
not
by
the
bench
of
judges
burlington
has
the
progressive
modern
city's
full
equipment
of
devices
for
right
and
intelligent
government
including
a
paid
fire
department
a
thing
which
the
great
city
of
new
orleans
is
without
but
still
employs
that
relic
of
antiquity
the
independent
system
in
burlington
as
in
all
these
upper
river
towns
one
breathes
a
go
ahead
atmosphere
which
tastes
good
in
the
nostrils
an
opera
house
has
lately
been
built
there
which
is
in
strong
contrast
with
the
shabby
dens
which
usually
do
duty
as
theaters
in
cities
of
burlington's
size
we
had
not
time
to
go
ashore
in
muscatine
but
had
a
daylight
view
of
it
from
the
boat
i
lived
there
awhile
many
years
ago
but
the
place
now
had
a
rather
unfamiliar
look
so
i
suppose
it
has
clear
outgrown
the
town
which
i
used
to
know
in
fact
i
know
it
has
for
i
remember
it
as
a
small
place
which
it
isn't
now
but
i
remember
it
best
for
a
lunatic
who
caught
me
out
in
the
fields
one
sunday
and
extracted
a
butcher
knife
from
his
boot
and
proposed
to
carve
me
up
with
it
unless
i
acknowledged
him
to
be
the
only
son
of
the
devil
i
tried
to
compromise
on
an
acknowledgment
that
he
was
the
only
member
of
the
family
i
had
met
but
that
did
not
satisfy
him
he
wouldn't
have
any
half
measures
i
must
say
he
was
the
sole
and
only
son
of
the
devil
he
whetted
his
knife
on
his
boot
it
did
not
seem
worth
while
to
make
trouble
about
a
little
thing
like
that
so
i
swung
round
to
his
view
of
the
matter
and
saved
my
skin
whole
shortly
afterward
he
went
to
visit
his
father
and
as
he
has
not
turned
up
since
i
trust
he
is
there
yet
and
i
remember
muscatine
still
more
pleasantly
for
its
summer
sunsets
i
have
never
seen
any
on
either
side
of
the
ocean
that
equaled
them
they
used
the
broad
smooth
river
as
a
canvas
and
painted
on
it
every
imaginable
dream
of
color
from
the
mottled
daintinesses
and
delicacies
of
the
opal
all
the
way
up
through
cumulative
intensities
to
blinding
purple
and
crimson
conflagrations
which
were
enchanting
to
the
eye
but
sharply
tried
it
at
the
same
time
all
the
upper
mississippi
region
has
these
extraordinary
sunsets
as
a
familiar
spectacle
it
is
the
true
sunset
land
i
am
sure
no
other
country
can
show
so
good
a
right
to
the
name
the
sunrises
are
also
said
to
be
exceedingly
fine
i
do
not
know
chapter
on
the
upper
river
the
big
towns
drop
in
thick
and
fast
now
and
between
stretch
processions
of
thrifty
farms
not
desolate
solitude
hour
by
hour
the
boat
plows
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
great
and
populous
north
west
and
with
each
successive
section
of
it
which
is
revealed
one's
surprise
and
respect
gather
emphasis
and
increase
such
a
people
and
such
achievements
as
theirs
compel
homage
this
is
an
independent
race
who
think
for
themselves
and
who
are
competent
to
do
it
because
they
are
educated
and
enlightened
they
read
they
keep
abreast
of
the
best
and
newest
thought
they
fortify
every
weak
place
in
their
land
with
a
school
a
college
a
library
and
a
newspaper
and
they
live
under
law
solicitude
for
the
future
of
a
race
like
this
is
not
in
order
this
region
is
new
so
new
that
it
may
be
said
to
be
still
in
its
babyhood
by
what
it
has
accomplished
while
still
teething
one
may
forecast
what
marvels
it
will
do
in
the
strength
of
its
maturity
it
is
so
new
that
the
foreign
tourist
has
not
heard
of
it
yet
and
has
not
visited
it
for
sixty
years
the
foreign
tourist
has
steamed
up
and
down
the
river
between
st
louis
and
new
orleans
and
then
gone
home
and
written
his
book
believing
he
had
seen
all
of
the
river
that
was
worth
seeing
or
that
had
anything
to
see
in
not
six
of
all
these
books
is
there
mention
of
these
upper
river
towns
for
the
reason
that
the
five
or
six
tourists
who
penetrated
this
region
did
it
before
these
towns
were
projected
the
latest
tourist
of
them
all
made
the
same
old
regulation
trip
he
had
not
heard
that
there
was
anything
north
of
st
louis
yet
there
was
there
was
this
amazing
region
bristling
with
great
towns
projected
day
before
yesterday
so
to
speak
and
built
next
morning
a
score
of
them
number
from
fifteen
hundred
to
five
thousand
people
then
we
have
muscatine
ten
thousand
winona
ten
thousand
moline
ten
thousand
rock
island
twelve
thousand
la
crosse
twelve
thousand
burlington
twenty
five
thousand
dubuque
twenty
five
thousand
davenport
thirty
thousand
st
paul
fifty
eight
thousand
minneapolis
sixty
thousand
and
upward
the
foreign
tourist
has
never
heard
of
these
there
is
no
note
of
them
in
his
books
they
have
sprung
up
in
the
night
while
he
slept
so
new
is
this
region
that
i
who
am
comparatively
young
am
yet
older
than
it
is
when
i
was
born
st
paul
had
a
population
of
three
persons
minneapolis
had
just
a
third
as
many
the
then
population
of
minneapolis
died
two
years
ago
and
when
he
died
he
had
seen
himself
undergo
an
increase
in
forty
years
of
fifty
nine
thousand
nine
hundred
and
ninety
nine
persons
he
had
a
frog's
fertility
i
must
explain
that
the
figures
set
down
above
as
the
population
of
st
paul
and
minneapolis
are
several
months
old
these
towns
are
far
larger
now
in
fact
i
have
just
seen
a
newspaper
estimate
which
gives
the
former
seventy
one
thousand
and
the
latter
seventy
eight
thousand
this
book
will
not
reach
the
public
for
six
or
seven
months
yet
none
of
the
figures
will
be
worth
much
then
we
had
a
glimpse
of
davenport
which
is
another
beautiful
city
crowning
a
hill
a
phrase
which
applies
to
all
these
towns
for
they
are
all
comely
all
well
built
clean
orderly
pleasant
to
the
eye
and
cheering
to
the
spirit
and
they
are
all
situated
upon
hills
therefore
we
will
give
that
phrase
a
rest
the
indians
have
a
tradition
that
marquette
and
joliet
camped
where
davenport
now
stands
in
the
next
white
man
who
camped
there
did
it
about
a
hundred
and
seventy
years
later
in
davenport
has
gathered
its
thirty
thousand
people
within
the
past
thirty
years
she
sends
more
children
to
her
schools
now
than
her
whole
population
numbered
twenty
three
years
ago
she
has
the
usual
upper
river
quota
of
factories
newspapers
and
institutions
of
learning
she
has
telephones
local
telegraphs
an
electric
alarm
and
an
admirable
paid
fire
department
consisting
of
six
hook
and
ladder
companies
four
steam
fire
engines
and
thirty
churches
davenport
is
the
official
residence
of
two
bishops
episcopal
and
catholic
opposite
davenport
is
the
flourishing
town
of

island
which
lies
at
the
foot
of
the
upper

a
great
railroad
bridge
connects
the
two
towns
one
of
the
thirteen
which
fret
the

the
charming
island
of
rock
island
three
miles
long
and
half
a
mile
wide
belongs
to
the
united
states
and
the
government
has
turned
it
into
a
wonderful
park
enhancing
its
natural
attractions
by
art
and
threading
its
fine
forests
with
many
miles
of
drives
near
the
center
of
the

one
catches
glimpses
through
the
trees
of
ten
vast
stone
four
story
buildings
each
of
which
covers
an
acre
of
ground
these
are
the

for
the

establishment
is
a
national
armory
and
arsenal
we
move
up
the
river
always
through
enchanting
scenery
there
being
no
other
kind
on
the
upper

pass

a

of
vast
manufacturing
industries
and
clinton
and
lyons
great
lumber
centers
and
presently
reach
dubuque
which
is
situated
in
a
rich
mineral
region
the
lead
mines
are
very
productive
and
of
wide
extent
dubuque
has
a
great
number
of
manufacturing
establishments
among
them
a
plow
factory
which
has
for
customers
all
christendom
in
general
at
least
so
i
was
told
by
an
agent
of
the
concern
who
was
on
the
boat
he
said
you
show
me
any
country
under
the
sun
where
they
really
know
how
to
plow
and
if
i
don't
show
you
our
mark
on
the
plow
they
use
i'll
eat
that
plow
and
i
won't
ask
for
any
woostershyre
sauce
to
flavor
it
up
with
either
all
this
part
of
the
river
is
rich
in
indian
history
and
traditions
black
hawk's
was
once
a
puissant
name
hereabouts
as
was
keokuk's
further
down
a
few
miles
below
dubuque
is
the
tete
de
mort
death's
head
rock
or
bluff
to
the
top
of
which
the
french
drove
a
band
of
indians
in
early
times
and
cooped
them
up
there
with
death
for
a
certainty
and
only
the
manner
of
it
matter
of
choice
to
starve
or
jump
off
and
kill
themselves
black
hawk
adopted
the
ways
of
the
white
people
toward
the
end
of
his
life
and
when
he
died
he
was
buried
near
des
moines
in
christian
fashion
modified
by
indian
custom
that
is
to
say
clothed
in
a
christian
military
uniform
and
with
a
christian
cane
in
his
hand
but
deposited
in
the
grave
in
a
sitting
posture
formerly
a
horse
had
always
been
buried
with
a
chief
the
substitution
of
the
cane
shows
that
black
hawk's
haughty
nature
was
really
humbled
and
he
expected
to
walk
when
he
got
over
we
noticed
that
above
dubuque
the
water
of
the
mississippi
was
olive
green
rich
and
beautiful
and
semi
transparent
with
the
sun
on
it
of
course
the
water
was
nowhere
as
clear
or
of
as
fine
a
complexion
as
it
is
in
some
other
seasons
of
the
year
for
now
it
was
at
flood
stage
and
therefore
dimmed
and
blurred
by
the
mud
manufactured
from
caving
banks
the
majestic
bluffs
that
overlook
the
river
along
through
this
region
charm
one
with
the
grace
and
variety
of
their
forms
and
the
soft
beauty
of
their
adornment
the
steep
verdant
slope
whose
base
is
at
the
water's
edge
is
topped
by
a
lofty
rampart
of
broken
turreted
rocks
which
are
exquisitely
rich
and
mellow
in
color
mainly
dark
browns
and
dull
greens
but
splashed
with
other
tints
and
then
you
have
the
shining
river
winding
here
and
there
and
yonder
its
sweep
interrupted
at
intervals
by
clusters
of
wooded
islands
threaded
by
silver
channels
and
you
have
glimpses
of
distant
villages
asleep
upon
capes
and
of
stealthy
rafts
slipping
along
in
the
shade
of
the
forest
walls
and
of
white
steamers
vanishing
around
remote
points
and
it
is
all
as
tranquil
and
reposeful
as
dreamland
and
has
nothing
this
worldly
about
it
nothing
to
hang
a
fret
or
a
worry
upon
until
the
unholy
train
comes
tearing
along
which
it
presently
does
ripping
the
sacred
solitude
to
rags
and
tatters
with
its
devil's
warwhoop
and
the
roar
and
thunder
of
its
rushing
wheels
and
straightway
you
are
back
in
this
world
and
with
one
of
its
frets
ready
to
hand
for
your
entertainment
for
you
remember
that
this
is
the
very
road
whose
stock
always
goes
down
after
you
buy
it
and
always
goes
up
again
as
soon
as
you
sell
it
it
makes
me
shudder
to
this
day
to
remember
that
i
once
came
near
not
getting
rid
of
my
stock
at
all
it
must
be
an
awful
thing
to
have
a
railroad
left
on
your
hands
the
locomotive
is
in
sight
from
the
deck
of
the
steamboat
almost
the
whole
way
from
st
louis
to
st
paul
eight
hundred
miles
these
railroads
have
made
havoc
with
the
steamboat
commerce
the
clerk
of
our
boat
was
a
steamboat
clerk
before
these
roads
were
built
in
that
day
the
influx
of
population
was
so
great
and
the
freight
business
so
heavy
that
the
boats
were
not
able
to
keep
up
with
the
demands
made
upon
their
carrying
capacity
consequently
the
captains
were
very
independent
and
airy
pretty
biggity
as
uncle
remus
would
say
the
clerk
nut
shelled
the
contrast
between
the
former
time
and
the
present
thus
boat
used
to
land
captain
on
hurricane
roof
mighty
stiff
and
straight
iron
ramrod
for
a
spine
kid
gloves
plug
tile
hair
parted
behind
man
on
shore
takes
off
hat
and
says
got
twenty
eight
tons
of
wheat
cap'n
be
great
favor
if
you
can
take
them
captain
says
ll
take
two
of
them
and
don't
even
condescend
to
look
at
him
but
nowadays
the
captain
takes
off
his
old
slouch
and
smiles
all
the
way
around
to
the
back
of
his
ears
and
gets
off
a
bow
which
he
hasn't
got
any
ramrod
to
interfere
with
and
says
glad
to
see
you
smith
glad
to
see
you
you're
looking
well
haven't
seen
you
looking
so
well
for
years
what
you
got
for
us
nuth'n
says
smith
and
keeps
his
hat
on
and
just
turns
his
back
and
goes
to
talking
with
somebody
else
oh
yes
eight
years
ago
the
captain
was
on
top
but
it's
smith's
turn
now
eight
years
ago
a
boat
used
to
go
up
the
river
with
every
stateroom
full
and
people
piled
five
and
six
deep
on
the
cabin
floor
and
a
solid
deck
load
of
immigrants
and
harvesters
down
below
into
the
bargain
to
get
a
first
class
stateroom
you'd
got
to
prove
sixteen
quarterings
of
nobility
and
four
hundred
years
of
descent
or
be
personally
acquainted
with
the
nigger
that
blacked
the
captain's
boots
but
it's
all
changed
now
plenty
staterooms
above
no
harvesters
below
there's
a
patent
self
binder
now
and
they
don't
have
harvesters
any
more
they've
gone
where
the
woodbine
twineth
and
they
didn't
go
by
steamboat
either
went
by
the
train
up
in
this
region
we
met
massed
acres
of
lumber
rafts
coming
down
but
not
floating
leisurely
along
in
the
old
fashioned
way
manned
with
joyous
and
reckless
crews
of
fiddling
song
singing
whiskey
drinking
breakdown
dancing
rapscallions
no
the
whole
thing
was
shoved
swiftly
along
by
a
powerful
stern
wheeler
modern
fashion
and
the
small
crews
were
quiet
orderly
men
of
a
sedate
business
aspect
with
not
a
suggestion
of
romance
about
them
anywhere
along
here
somewhere
on
a
black
night
we
ran
some
exceedingly
narrow
and
intricate
island
chutes
by
aid
of
the
electric
light
behind
was
solid
blackness
a
crackless
bank
of
it
ahead
a
narrow
elbow
of
water
curving
between
dense
walls
of
foliage
that
almost
touched
our
bows
on
both
sides
and
here
every
individual
leaf
and
every
individual
ripple
stood
out
in
its
natural
color
and
flooded
with
a
glare
as
of
noonday
intensified
the
effect
was
strange
and
fine
and
very
striking
we
passed
prairie
du
chien
another
of
father
marquette's
camping
places
and
after
some
hours
of
progress
through
varied
and
beautiful
scenery
reached
la
crosse
here
is
a
town
of
twelve
or
thirteen
thousand
population
with
electric
lighted
streets
and
with
blocks
of
buildings
which
are
stately
enough
and
also
architecturally
fine
enough
to
command
respect
in
any
city
it
is
a
choice
town
and
we
made
satisfactory
use
of
the
hour
allowed
us
in
roaming
it
over
though
the
weather
was
rainier
than
necessary
chapter
legends
and
scenery
we
added
several
passengers
to
our
list
at
la
crosse
among
others
an
old
gentleman
who
had
come
to
this
north
western
region
with
the
early
settlers
and
was
familiar
with
every
part
of
it
pardonably
proud
of
it
too
he
said
you'll
find
scenery
between
here
and
st
paul
that
can
give
the
hudson
points
you'll
have
the
queen's
bluff
seven
hundred
feet
high
and
just
as
imposing
a
spectacle
as
you
can
find
anywheres
and
trempeleau
island
which
isn't
like
any
other
island
in
america
i
believe
for
it
is
a
gigantic
mountain
with
precipitous
sides
and
is
full
of
indian
traditions
and
used
to
be
full
of
rattlesnakes
if
you
catch
the
sun
just
right
there
you
will
have
a
picture
that
will
stay
with
you
and
above
winona
you'll
have
lovely
prairies
and
then
come
the
thousand
islands
too
beautiful
for
anything
green
why
you
never
saw
foliage
so
green
nor
packed
so
thick
it's
like
a
thousand
plush
cushions
afloat
on
a
looking
glass
when
the
water
s
still
and
then
the
monstrous
bluffs
on
both
sides
of
the
river
ragged
rugged
dark
complected
just
the
frame
that's
wanted
you
always
want
a
strong
frame
you
know
to
throw
up
the
nice
points
of
a
delicate
picture
and
make
them
stand
out
the
old
gentleman
also
told
us
a
touching
indian
legend
or
two
but
not
very
powerful
ones
after
this
excursion
into
history
he
came
back
to
the
scenery
and
described
it
detail
by
detail
from
the
thousand
islands
to
st
paul
naming
its
names
with
such
facility
tripping
along
his
theme
with
such
nimble
and
confident
ease
slamming
in
a
three
ton
word
here
and
there
with
such
a
complacent
air
of
t
isn't
anything
i
can
do
it
any
time
i
want
to
and
letting
off
fine
surprises
of
lurid
eloquence
at
such
judicious
intervals
that
i
presently
began
to
suspect
but
no
matter
what
i
began
to
suspect
hear
him
ten
miles
above
winona
we
come
to
fountain
city
nestling
sweetly
at
the
feet
of
cliffs
that
lift
their
awful
fronts
jovelike
toward
the
blue
depths
of
heaven
bathing
them
in
virgin
atmospheres
that
have
known
no
other
contact
save
that
of
angels
wings
and
next
we
glide
through
silver
waters
amid
lovely
and
stupendous
aspects
of
nature
that
attune
our
hearts
to
adoring
admiration
about
twelve
miles
and
strike
mount
vernon
six
hundred
feet
high
with
romantic
ruins
of
a
once
first
class
hotel
perched
far
among
the
cloud
shadows
that
mottle
its
dizzy
heights
sole
remnant
of
once
flourishing
mount
vernon
town
of
early
days
now
desolate
and
utterly
deserted
and
so
we
move
on
past
chimney
rock
we
fly
noble
shaft
of
six
hundred
feet
then
just
before
landing
at
minnieska
our
attention
is
attracted
by
a
most
striking
promontory
rising
over
five
hundred
feet
the
ideal
mountain
pyramid
its
conic
shape
thickly
wooded
surface
girding
its
sides
and
its
apex
like
that
of
a
cone
cause
the
spectator
to
wonder
at
nature's
workings
from
its
dizzy
heights
superb
views
of
the
forests
streams
bluffs
hills
and
dales
below
and
beyond
for
miles
are
brought
within
its
focus
what
grander
river
scenery
can
be
conceived
as
we
gaze
upon
this
enchanting
landscape
from
the
uppermost
point
of
these
bluffs
upon
the
valleys
below
the
primeval
wildness
and
awful
loneliness
of
these
sublime
creations
of
nature
and
nature's
god
excite
feelings
of
unbounded
admiration
and
the
recollection
of
which
can
never
be
effaced
from
the
memory
as
we
view
them
in
any
direction
next
we
have
the
lion's
head
and
the
lioness's
head
carved
by
nature's
hand
to
adorn
and
dominate
the
beauteous
stream
and
then
anon
the
river
widens
and
a
most
charming
and
magnificent
view
of
the
valley
before
us
suddenly
bursts
upon
our
vision
rugged
hills
clad
with
verdant
forests
from
summit
to
base
level
prairie
lands
holding
in
their
lap
the
beautiful
wabasha
city
of
the
healing
waters
puissant
foe
of
bright's
disease
and
that
grandest
conception
of
nature's
works
incomparable
lake
pepin
these
constitute
a
picture
whereon
the
tourist's
eye
may
gaze
uncounted
hours
with
rapture
unappeased
and
unappeasable
and
so
we
glide
along
in
due
time
encountering
those
majestic
domes
the
mighty
sugar
loaf
and
the
sublime
maiden's
rock
which
latter
romantic
superstition
has
invested
with
a
voice
and
oft
times
as
the
birch
canoe
glides
near
at
twilight
the
dusky
paddler
fancies
he
hears
the
soft
sweet
music
of
the
long
departed
winona
darling
of
indian
song
and
story
then
frontenac
looms
upon
our
vision
delightful
resort
of
jaded
summer
tourists
then
progressive
red
wing
and
diamond
bluff
impressive
and
preponderous
in
its
lone
sublimity
then
prescott
and
the
st
croix
and
anon
we
see
bursting
upon
us
the
domes
and
steeples
of
st
paul
giant
young
chief
of
the
north
marching
with
seven
league
stride
in
the
van
of
progress
banner
bearer
of
the
highest
and
newest
civilization
carving
his
beneficent
way
with
the
tomahawk
of
commercial
enterprise
sounding
the
warwhoop
of
christian
culture
tearing
off
the
reeking
scalp
of
sloth
and
superstition
to
plant
there
the
steam
plow
and
the
school
house
ever
in
his
front
stretch
arid
lawlessness
ignorance
crime
despair
ever
in
his
wake
bloom
the
jail
the
gallows
and
the
pulpit
and
ever
have
you
ever
traveled
with
a
panorama
i
have
formerly
served
in
that
capacity
my
suspicion
was
confirmed
do
you
still
travel
with
it
no
she
is
laid
up
till
the
fall
season
opens
i
am
helping
now
to
work
up
the
materials
for
a
tourist's
guide
which
the
st
louis
and
st
paul
packet
company
are
going
to
issue
this
summer
for
the
benefit
of
travelers
who
go
by
that
line
when
you
were
talking
of
maiden's
rock
you
spoke
of
the
long
departed
winona
darling
of
indian
song
and
story
is
she
the
maiden
of
the
rock
and
are
the
two
connected
by
legend
yes
and
a
very
tragic
and
painful
one
perhaps
the
most
celebrated
as
well
as
the
most
pathetic
of
all
the
legends
of
the
mississippi
we
asked
him
to
tell
it
he
dropped
out
of
his
conversational
vein
and
back
into
his
lecture
gait
without
an
effort
and
rolled
on
as
follows
a
little
distance
above
lake
city
is
a
famous
point
known
as
maiden's
rock
which
is
not
only
a
picturesque
spot
but
is
full
of
romantic
interest
from
the
event
which
gave
it
its
name
not
many
years
ago
this
locality
was
a
favorite
resort
for
the
sioux
indians
on
account
of
the
fine
fishing
and
hunting
to
be
had
there
and
large
numbers
of
them
were
always
to
be
found
in
this
locality
among
the
families
which
used
to
resort
here
was
one
belonging
to
the
tribe
of
wabasha
we
no
na
first
born
was
the
name
of
a
maiden
who
had
plighted
her
troth
to
a
lover
belonging
to
the
same
band
but
her
stern
parents
had
promised
her
hand
to
another
a
famous
warrior
and
insisted
on
her
wedding
him
the
day
was
fixed
by
her
parents
to
her
great
grief
she
appeared
to
accede
to
the
proposal
and
accompany
them
to
the
rock
for
the
purpose
of
gathering
flowers
for
the
feast
on
reaching
the
rock
we
no
na
ran
to
its
summit
and
standing
on
its
edge
upbraided
her
parents
who
were
below
for
their
cruelty
and
then
singing
a
death
dirge
threw
herself
from
the
precipice
and
dashed
them
in
pieces
on
the
rock
below
dashed
who
in
pieces
her
parents
yes
well
it
certainly
was
a
tragic
business
as
you
say
and
moreover
there
is
a
startling
kind
of
dramatic
surprise
about
it
which
i
was
not
looking
for
it
is
a
distinct
improvement
upon
the
threadbare
form
of
indian
legend
there
are
fifty
lover's
leaps
along
the
mississippi
from
whose
summit
disappointed
indian
girls
have
jumped
but
this
is
the
only
jump
in
the
lot
hat
turned
out
in
the
right
and
satisfactory
way
what
became
of
winona
she
was
a
good
deal
jarred
up
and
jolted
but
she
got
herself
together
and
disappeared
before
the
coroner
reached
the
fatal
spot
and
tis
said
she
sought
and
married
her
true
love
and
wandered
with
him
to
some
distant
clime
where
she
lived
happy
ever
after
her
gentle
spirit
mellowed
and
chastened
by
the
romantic
incident
which
had
so
early
deprived
her
of
the
sweet
guidance
of
a
mother's
love
and
a
father's
protecting
arm
and
thrown
her
all
unfriended
upon
the
cold
charity
of
a
censorious
world
i
was
glad
to
hear
the
lecturer's
description
of
the
scenery
for
it
assisted
my
appreciation
of
what
i
saw
of
it
and
enabled
me
to
imagine
such
of
it
as
we
lost
by
the
intrusion
of
night
as
the
lecturer
remarked
this
whole
region
is
blanketed
with
indian
tales
and
traditions
but
i
reminded
him
that
people
usually
merely
mention
this
fact
doing
it
in
a
way
to
make
a
body's
mouth
water
and
judiciously
stopped
there
why
because
the
impression
left
was
that
these
tales
were
full
of
incident
and
imagination
a
pleasant
impression
which
would
be
promptly
dissipated
if
the
tales
were
told
i
showed
him
a
lot
of
this
sort
of
literature
which
i
had
been
collecting
and
he
confessed
that
it
was
poor
stuff
exceedingly
sorry
rubbish
and
i
ventured
to
add
that
the
legends
which
he
had
himself
told
us
were
of
this
character
with
the
single
exception
of
the
admirable
story
of
winona
he
granted
these
facts
but
said
that
if
i
would
hunt
up
mr
schoolcraft's
book
published
near
fifty
years
ago
and
now
doubtless
out
of
print
i
would
find
some
indian
inventions
in
it
that
were
very
far
from
being
barren
of
incident
and
imagination
that
the
tales
in
hiawatha
were
of
this
sort
and
they
came
from
schoolcraft's
book
and
that
there
were
others
in
the
same
book
which
mr
longfellow
could
have
turned
into
verse
with
good
effect
for
instance
there
was
the
legend
of
the
undying
head
he
could
not
tell
it
for
many
of
the
details
had
grown
dim
in
his
memory
but
he
would
recommend
me
to
find
it
and
enlarge
my
respect
for
the
indian
imagination
he
said
that
this
tale
and
most
of
the
others
in
the
book
were
current
among
the
indians
along
this
part
of
the
mississippi
when
he
first
came
here
and
that
the
contributors
to
schoolcraft's
book
had
got
them
directly
from
indian
lips
and
had
written
them
down
with
strict
exactness
and
without
embellishments
of
their
own
i
have
found
the
book
the
lecturer
was
right
there
are
several
legends
in
it
which
confirm
what
he
said
i
will
offer
two
of
them
the
undying
head
and
peboan
and
seegwun
an
allegory
of
the
seasons
the
latter
is
used
in
hiawatha
but
it
is
worth
reading
in
the
original
form
if
only
that
one
may
see
how
effective
a
genuine
poem
can
be
without
the
helps
and
graces
of
poetic
measure
and
rhythm
peboan
and
seegwun
an
old
man
was
sitting
alone
in
his
lodge
by
the
side
of
a
frozen
stream
it
was
the
close
of
winter
and
his
fire
was
almost
out
he
appeared
very
old
and
very
desolate
his
locks
were
white
with
age
and
he
trembled
in
every
joint
day
after
day
passed
in
solitude
and
he
heard
nothing
but
the
sound
of
the
tempest
sweeping
before
it
the
new
fallen
snow
one
day
as
his
fire
was
just
dying
a
handsome
young
man
approached
and
entered
his
dwelling
his
cheeks
were
red
with
the
blood
of
youth
his
eyes
sparkled
with
animation
and
a
smile
played
upon
his
lips
he
walked
with
a
light
and
quick
step
his
forehead
was
bound
with
a
wreath
of
sweet
grass
in
place
of
a
warrior's
frontlet
and
he
carried
a
bunch
of
flowers
in
his
hand
ah
my
son
said
the
old
man
i
am
happy
to
see
you
come
in
come
and
tell
me
of
your
adventures
and
what
strange
lands
you
have
been
to
see
let
us
pass
the
night
together
i
will
tell
you
of
my
prowess
and
exploits
and
what
i
can
perform
you
shall
do
the
same
and
we
will
amuse
ourselves
he
then
drew
from
his
sack
a
curiously
wrought
antique
pipe
and
having
filled
it
with
tobacco
rendered
mild
by
a
mixture
of
certain
leaves
handed
it
to
his
guest
when
this
ceremony
was
concluded
they
began
to
speak
i
blow
my
breath
said
the
old
man
and
the
stream
stands
still
the
water
becomes
stiff
and
hard
as
clear
stone
i
breathe
said
the
young
man
and
flowers
spring
up
over
the
plain
i
shake
my
locks
retorted
the
old
man
and
snow
covers
the
land
the
leaves
fall
from
the
trees
at
my
command
and
my
breath
blows
them
away
the
birds
get
up
from
the
water
and
fly
to
a
distant
land
the
animals
hide
themselves
from
my
breath
and
the
very
ground
becomes
as
hard
as
flint
i
shake
my
ringlets
rejoined
the
young
man
and
warm
showers
of
soft
rain
fall
upon
the
earth
the
plants
lift
up
their
heads
out
of
the
earth
like
the
eyes
of
children
glistening
with
delight
my
voice
recalls
the
birds
the
warmth
of
my
breath
unlocks
the
streams
music
fills
the
groves
wherever
i
walk
and
all
nature
rejoices
at
length
the
sun
began
to
rise
a
gentle
warmth
came
over
the
place
the
tongue
of
the
old
man
became
silent
the
robin
and
bluebird
began
to
sing
on
the
top
of
the
lodge
the
stream
began
to
murmur
by
the
door
and
the
fragrance
of
growing
herbs
and
flowers
came
softly
on
the
vernal
breeze
daylight
fully
revealed
to
the
young
man
the
character
of
his
entertainer
when
he
looked
upon
him
he
had
the
icy
visage
of
peboan
footnote
streams
began
to
flow
from
his
eyes
as
the
sun
increased
he
grew
less
and
less
in
stature
and
anon
had
melted
completely
away
nothing
remained
on
the
place
of
his
lodge
fire
but
the
miskodeed

trailing

flower
with
a
pink
border

the
undying

is
a
rather
long
tale
but
it
makes
up
in
weird
conceits

tale
prodigies
variety

speculations
and
conclusions
we
reached
st
paul
at
the
head
of
navigation
of
the
mississippi
and
there
our
voyage
of
two
thousand
miles
from
new
orleans
ended
it
is
about
a
ten
day
trip
by
steamer
it
can
probably
be
done
quicker
by
rail
i
judge
so
because
i
know
that
one
may
go
by
rail
from
st
louis
to
hannibal
a
distance
of
at
least
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
in
seven
hours
this
is
better
than
walking
unless
one
is
in
a
hurry
the
season
being
far
advanced
when
we
were
in
new
orleans
the
roses
and
magnolia
blossoms
were
falling
but
here
in
st
paul
it
was
the
snow
in
new
orleans
we
had
caught
an
occasional
withering
breath
from
over
a
crater
apparently
here
in
st
paul
we
caught
a
frequent
benumbing
one
from
over
a
glacier
apparently
but
i
wander
from
my
theme
st
paul
is
a
wonderful
town
it
is
put
together
in
solid
blocks
of
honest
brick
and
stone
and
has
the
air
of
intending
to
stay
its
post
office
was
established
thirty
six
years
ago
and
by
and
by
when
the
postmaster
received
a
letter
he
carried
it
to
washington
horseback
to
inquire
what
was
to
be
done
with
it
such
is
the
legend
two
frame
houses
were
built
that
year
and
several
persons
were
added
to
the
population
a
recent
number
of
the
leading
st
paul
paper
the
pioneer
press
gives
some
statistics
which
furnish
a
vivid
contrast
to
that
old
state
of
things
to
wit
population
autumn
of
the
present
year
number
of
letters
handled
first
half
of
the

number
of

built
during
three
quarters
of
the
year
their
cost
the
increase
of
letters
over
the
corresponding
six
months
of
last
year
was
fifty
per
cent
last
year
the
new
buildings
added
to
the
city
cost
above
st
paul's
strength
lies
in
her
commerce
i
mean
his
commerce
he
is
a
manufacturing
city
of
course
all
the
cities
of
that
region
are
but
he
is
peculiarly
strong
in
the
matter
of
commerce
last
year
his
jobbing
trade
amounted
to
upwards
of
he
has
a
custom
house
and
is
building
a
costly
capitol
to
replace
the
one
recently
burned
for
he
is
the
capital
of
the
state
he
has
churches
without
end
and
not
the
cheap
poor
kind
but
the
kind
that
the
rich
protestant
puts
up
the
kind
that
the
poor
irish
hired
girl
delights
to
erect
what
a
passion
for
building
majestic
churches
the
irish
hired
girl
has
it
is
a
fine
thing
for
our
architecture
but
too
often
we
enjoy
her
stately
fanes
without
giving
her
a
grateful
thought
in
fact
instead
of
reflecting
that
every
brick
and
every
stone
in
this
beautiful
edifice
represents
an
ache
or
a
pain
and
a
handful
of
sweat
and
hours
of
heavy
fatigue
contributed
by
the
back
and
forehead
and
bones
of
poverty
it
is
our
habit
to
forget
these
things
entirely
and
merely
glorify
the
mighty
temple
itself
without
vouchsafing
one
praiseful
thought
to
its
humble
builder
whose
rich
heart
and
withered
purse
it
symbolizes
this
is
a
land
of
libraries
and
schools
st
paul
has
three
public
libraries
and
they
contain
in
the
aggregate
some
forty
thousand
books
he
has
one
hundred
and
sixteen
school
houses
and
pays
out
more
than
seventy
thousand
dollars
a
year
in
teachers
salaries
there
is
an
unusually
fine
railway
station
so
large
is
it
in
fact
that
it
seemed
somewhat
overdone
in
the
matter
of
size
at
first
but
at
the
end
of
a
few
months
it
was
perceived
that
the
mistake
was
distinctly
the
other
way
the
error
is
to
be
corrected
the
town
stands
on
high
ground
it
is
about
seven
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
level
it
is
so
high
that
a
wide
view
of
river
and
lowland
is
offered
from
its
streets
it
is
a
very
wonderful
town
indeed
and
is
not
finished
yet
all
the
streets
are
obstructed
with
building
material
and
this
is
being
compacted
into
houses
as
fast
as
possible
to
make
room
for
more
for
other
people
are
anxious
to
build
as
soon
as
they
can
get
the
use
of
the
streets
to
pile
up
their
bricks
and
stuff
in
how
solemn
and
beautiful
is
the
thought
that
the
earliest
pioneer
of
civilization
the
van
leader
of
civilization
is
never
the
steamboat
never
the
railroad
never
the
newspaper
never
the
sabbath
school
never
the
missionary
but
always
whiskey
such
is
the
case
look
history
over
you
will
see
the
missionary
comes
after
the
whiskey
i
mean
he
arrives
after
the
whiskey
has
arrived
next
comes
the
poor
immigrant
with
ax
and
hoe
and
rifle
next
the
trader
next
the
miscellaneous
rush
next
the
gambler
the
desperado
the
highwayman
and
all
their
kindred
in
sin
of
both
sexes
and
next
the
smart
chap
who
has
bought
up
an
old
grant
that
covers
all
the
land
this
brings
the
lawyer
tribe
the
vigilance
committee
brings
the
undertaker
all
these
interests
bring
the
newspaper
the
newspaper
starts
up
politics
and
a
railroad
all
hands
turn
to
and
build
a
church
and
a
jail
and
behold
civilization
is
established
for
ever
in
the
land
but
whiskey
you
see
was
the
van
leader
in
this
beneficent
work
it
always
is
it
was
like
a
foreigner
and
excusable
in
a
foreigner
to
be
ignorant
of
this
great
truth
and
wander
off
into
astronomy
to
borrow
a
symbol
but
if
he
had
been
conversant
with
the
facts
he
would
have
said
westward
the
jug
of
empire
takes
its
way
this
great
van
leader
arrived
upon
the
ground
which
st
paul
now
occupies
in
june
yes
at
that
date
pierre
parrant
a
canadian
built
the
first
cabin
uncorked
his
jug
and
began
to
sell
whiskey
to
the
indians
the
result
is
before
us
all
that
i
have
said
of
the
newness
briskness
swift
progress
wealth
intelligence
fine
and
substantial
architecture
and
general
slash
and
go
and
energy
of
st
paul
will
apply
to
his
near
neighbor
minneapolis
with
the
addition
that
the
latter
is
the
bigger
of
the
two
cities
these
extraordinary
towns
were
ten
miles
apart
a
few
months
ago
but
were
growing
so
fast
that
they
may
possibly
be
joined
now
and
getting
along
under
a
single
mayor
at
any
rate
within
five
years
from
now
there
will
be
at
least
such
a
substantial
ligament
of
buildings
stretching
between
them
and
uniting
them
that
a
stranger
will
not
be
able
to
tell
where
the
one
siamese
twin
leaves
off
and
the
other
begins
combined
they
will
then
number
a
population
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
if
they
continue
to
grow
as
they
are
now
growing
thus
this
center
of
population
at
the
head
of
mississippi
navigation
will
then
begin
a
rivalry
as
to
numbers
with
that
center
of
population
at
the
foot
of
it
new
orleans
minneapolis
is
situated
at
the

of
st

stretch
across

fifteen
hundred
feet
and
have
a
fall
of
eighty
two

which
by
art
has
been
made

inestimable
value

somewhat

the

a
spectacle

a
background
against

get
your

taken

choicest

so

sufficiently
celebrated
they
do
not
need
a
lift
from
me
in
that
direction
the
white

lake
is
less
known
it
is
a
lovely
sheet
of
water
and
is
being
utilized
as
a
summer
resort
by
the
wealth
and
fashion
of
the
state
it
has
its
club

its

with

but
the
white

lake
is
the
resort
connected
with
white

lake
is
a
most
idiotic
indian
legend
i
would
resist
the
temptation
to
print
it
here
if
i
could
but
the
task
is
beyond

strength
the

names
the

of

compliments
his
facile
pen
without
further
comment
or
delay
then
let
us
turn
the
said
facile
pen
loose
upon
the
reader
a
legend
of
white
bear
lake
every
spring
for
perhaps
a
century
or
as
long
as
there
has
been
a
nation
of
red
men
an
island
in
the
middle
of
white
bear
lake
has
been
visited
by
a
band
of
indians
for
the
purpose
of
making
maple
sugar
tradition
says
that
many
springs
ago
while
upon
this
island
a
young
warrior
loved
and
wooed
the
daughter
of
his
chief
and
it
is
said
also
the
maiden
loved
the
warrior
he
had
again
and
again
been
refused
her
hand
by
her
parents
the
old
chief
alleging
that
he
was
no
brave
and
his
old
consort
called
him
a
woman
the
sun
had
again
set
upon
the
sugar
bush
and
the
bright
moon
rose
high
in
the
bright
blue
heavens
when
the
young
warrior
took
down
his
flute
and
went
out
alone
once
more
to
sing
the
story
of
his
love
the
mild
breeze
gently
moved
the
two
gay
feathers
in
his
head
dress
and
as
he
mounted
on
the
trunk
of
a
leaning
tree
the
damp
snow
fell
from
his
feet
heavily
as
he
raised
his
flute
to
his
lips
his
blanket
slipped
from
his
well
formed
shoulders
and
lay
partly
on
the
snow
beneath
he
began
his
weird
wild
love
song
but
soon
felt
that
he
was
cold
and
as
he
reached
back
for
his
blanket
some
unseen
hand
laid
it
gently
on
his
shoulders
it
was
the
hand
of
his
love
his
guardian
angel
she
took
her
place
beside
him
and
for
the
present
they
were
happy
for
the
indian
has
a
heart
to
love
and
in
this
pride
he
is
as
noble
as
in
his
own
freedom
which
makes
him
the
child
of
the
forest
as
the
legend
runs
a
large
white
bear
thinking
perhaps
that
polar
snows
and
dismal
winter
weather
extended
everywhere
took
up
his
journey
southward
he
at
length
approached
the
northern
shore
of
the
lake
which
now
bears
his
name
walked
down
the
bank
and
made
his
way
noiselessly
through
the
deep
heavy
snow
toward
the
island
it
was
the
same
spring
ensuing
that
the
lovers
met
they
had
left
their
first
retreat
and
were
now
seated
among
the
branches
of
a
large
elm
which
hung
far
over
the
lake
the
same
tree
is
still
standing
and
excites
universal
curiosity
and
interest
for
fear
of
being
detected
they
talked
almost
in
a
whisper
and
now
that
they
might
get
back
to
camp
in
good
time
and
thereby
avoid
suspicion
they
were
just
rising
to
return
when
the
maiden
uttered
a
shriek
which
was
heard
at
the
camp
and
bounding
toward
the
young
brave
she
caught
his
blanket
but
missed
the
direction
of
her
foot
and
fell
bearing
the
blanket
with
her
into
the
great
arms
of
the
ferocious
monster
instantly
every
man
woman
and
child
of
the
band
were
upon
the
bank
but
all
unarmed
cries
and
wailings
went
up
from
every
mouth
what
was
to
be
done
in
the
meantime
this
white
and
savage
beast
held
the
breathless
maiden
in
his
huge
grasp
and
fondled
with
his
precious
prey
as
if
he
were
used
to
scenes
like
this
one
deafening
yell
from
the
lover
warrior
is
heard
above
the
cries
of
hundreds
of
his
tribe
and
dashing
away
to
his
wigwam
he
grasps
his
faithful
knife
returns
almost
at
a
single
bound
to
the
scene
of
fear
and
fright
rushes
out
along
the
leaning
tree
to
the
spot
where
his
treasure
fell
and
springing
with
the
fury
of
a
mad
panther
pounced
upon
his
prey
the
animal
turned
and
with
one
stroke
of
his
huge
paw
brought
the
lovers
heart
to
heart
but
the
next
moment
the
warrior
with
one
plunge
of
the
blade
of
his
knife
opened
the
crimson
sluices
of
death
and
the
dying
bear
relaxed
his
hold
that
night
there
was
no
more
sleep
for
the
band
or
the
lovers
and
as
the
young
and
the
old
danced
about
the
carcass
of
the
dead
monster
the
gallant
warrior
was
presented
with
another
plume
and
ere
another
moon
had
set
he
had
a
living
treasure
added
to
his
heart
their
children
for
many
years
played
upon
the
skin
of
the
white
bear
from
which
the
lake
derives
its
name
and
the
maiden
and
the
brave
remembered
long
the
fearful
scene
and
rescue
that
made
them
one
for
kis
se
me
pa
and
ka
go
ka
could
never
forget
their
fearful
encounter
with
the
huge
monster
that
came
so
near
sending
them
to
the
happy
hunting
ground
it
is
a
perplexing
business
first
she
fell
down
out
of
the
tree
she
and
the
blanket
and
the
bear
caught
her
and
fondled
her
her
and
the
blanket
then
she
fell
up
into
the
tree
again
leaving
the
blanket
meantime
the
lover
goes
war
whooping
home
and
comes
back
heeled
climbs
the
tree
jumps
down
on
the
bear
the
girl
jumps
down
after
him
apparently
for
she
was
up
the
tree
resumes
her
place
in
the
bear's
arms
along
with
the
blanket
the
lover
rams
his
knife
into
the
bear
and
saves
whom
the
blanket
no
nothing
of
the
sort
you
get
yourself
all
worked
up
and
excited
about
that
blanket
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
just
when
a
happy
climax
seems
imminent
you
are
let
down
flat
nothing
saved
but
the
girl
whereas
one
is
not
interested
in
the
girl
she
is
not
the
prominent
feature
of
the
legend
nevertheless
there
you
are
left
and
there
you
must
remain
for
if
you
live
a
thousand
years
you
will
never
know
who
got
the
blanket
a
dead
man
could
get
up
a
better
legend
than
this
one
i
don't
mean
a
fresh
dead
man
either
i
mean
a
man
that's
been
dead
weeks
and
weeks
we
struck
the
home
trail
now
and
in
a
few
hours
were
in
that
astonishing
chicago
a
city
where
they
are
always
rubbing
the
lamp
and
fetching
up
the
genii
and
contriving
and
achieving
new
impossibilities
it
is
hopeless
for
the
occasional
visitor
to
try
to
keep
up
with
chicago
she
outgrows
his
prophecies
faster
than
he
can
make
them
she
is
always
a
novelty
for
she
is
never
the
chicago
you
saw
when
you
passed
through
the
last
time
the
pennsylvania
road
rushed
us
to
new
york
without
missing
schedule
time
ten
minutes
anywhere
on
the
route
and
there
ended
one
of
the
most
enjoyable
five
thousand
mile
journeys
i
have
ever
had
the
good
fortune
to
make
appendix
appendix
a
from
the
new
orleans
times
democrat
of
march
voyage
of
the
times
democrat's
relief
boat
through
the
inundated
regions
it
was
nine
o'clock
thursday
morning
when
the
susie
left
the
mississippi
and
entered
old
river
or
what
is
now
called
the
mouth
of
the
red
ascending
on
the
left
a
flood
was
pouring
in
through
and
over
the
levees
on
the
chandler
plantation
the
most
northern
point
in
pointe
coupee
parish
the
water
completely
covered
the
place
although
the
levees
had
given
way
but
a
short
time
before
the
stock
had
been
gathered
in
a
large
flat
boat
where
without
food
as
we
passed
the
animals
were
huddled
together
waiting
for
a
boat
to
tow
them
off
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
river
is
turnbull's
island
and
on
it
is
a
large
plantation
which
formerly
was
pronounced
one
of
the
most
fertile
in
the
state
the
water
has
hitherto
allowed
it
to
go
scot
free
in
usual
floods
but
now
broad
sheets
of
water
told
only
where
fields
were
the
top
of
the
protecting
levee
could
be
seen
here
and
there
but
nearly
all
of
it
was
submerged
the
trees
have
put
on
a
greener
foliage
since
the
water
has
poured
in
and
the
woods
look
bright
and
fresh
but
this
pleasant
aspect
to
the
eye
is
neutralized
by
the
interminable
waste
of
water
we
pass
mile
after
mile
and
it
is
nothing
but
trees
standing
up
to
their
branches
in
water
a
water
turkey
now
and
again
rises
and
flies
ahead
into
the
long
avenue
of
silence
a
pirogue
sometimes
flits
from
the
bushes
and
crosses
the
red
river
on
its
way
out
to
the
mississippi
but
the
sad
faced
paddlers
never
turn
their
heads
to
look
at
our
boat
the
puffing
of
the
boat
is
music
in
this
gloom
which
affects
one
most
curiously
it
is
not
the
gloom
of
deep
forests
or
dark
caverns
but
a
peculiar
kind
of
solemn
silence
and
impressive
awe
that
holds
one
perforce
to
its
recognition
we
passed
two
negro
families
on
a
raft
tied
up
in
the
willows
this
morning
they
were
evidently
of
the
well
to
do
class
as
they
had
a
supply
of
meal
and
three
or
four
hogs
with
them
their
rafts
were
about
twenty
feet
square
and
in
front
of
an
improvised
shelter
earth
had
been
placed
on
which
they
built
their
fire
the
current
running
down
the
atchafalaya
was
very
swift
the
mississippi
showing
a
predilection
in
that
direction
which
needs
only
to
be
seen
to
enforce
the
opinion
of
that
river's
desperate
endeavors
to
find
a
short
way
to
the
gulf
small
boats
skiffs
pirogues
etc
are
in
great
demand
and
many
have
been
stolen
by
piratical
negroes
who
take
them
where
they
will
bring
the
greatest
price
from
what
was
told
me
by
mr
c
p
ferguson
a
planter
near
red
river
landing
whose
place
has
just
gone
under
there
is
much
suffering
in
the
rear
of
that
place
the
negroes
had
given
up
all
thoughts
of
a
crevasse
there
as
the
upper
levee
had
stood
so
long
and
when
it
did
come
they
were
at
its
mercy
on
thursday
a
number
were
taken
out
of
trees
and
off
of
cabin
roofs
and
brought
in
many
yet
remaining
one
does
not
appreciate
the
sight
of
earth
until
he
has
traveled
through
a
flood
at
sea
one
does
not
expect
or
look
for
it
but
here
with
fluttering
leaves
shadowy
forest
aisles
house
tops
barely
visible
it
is
expected
in
fact
a
grave
yard
if
the
mounds
were
above
water
would
be
appreciated
the
river
here
is
known
only
because
there
is
an
opening
in
the
trees
and
that
is
all
it
is
in
width
from
fort
adams
on
the
left
bank
of
the
mississippi
to
the
bank
of
rapides
parish
a
distance
of
about
sixty
miles
a
large
portion
of
this
was
under
cultivation
particularly
along
the
mississippi
and
back
of
the
red
when
red
river
proper
was
entered
a
strong
current
was
running
directly
across
it
pursuing
the
same
direction
as
that
of
the
mississippi
after
a
run
of
some
hours
black
river
was
reached
hardly
was
it
entered
before
signs
of
suffering
became
visible
all
the
willows
along
the
banks
were
stripped
of
their
leaves
one
man
whom
your
correspondent
spoke
to
said
that
he
had
had
one
hundred
and
fifty
head
of
cattle
and
one
hundred
head
of
hogs
at
the
first
appearance
of
water
he
had
started
to
drive
them
to
the
high
lands
of
avoyelles
thirty
five
miles
off
but
he
lost
fifty
head
of
the
beef
cattle
and
sixty
hogs
black
river
is
quite
picturesque
even
if
its
shores
are
under
water
a
dense
growth
of
ash
oak
gum
and
hickory
make
the
shores
almost
impenetrable
and
where
one
can
get
a
view
down
some
avenue
in
the
trees
only
the
dim
outlines
of
distant
trunks
can
be
barely
distinguished
in
the
gloom
a
few
miles
up
this
river
the
depth
of
water
on
the
banks
was
fully
eight
feet
and
on
all
sides
could
be
seen
still
holding
against
the
strong
current
the
tops
of
cabins
here
and
there
one
overturned
was
surrounded
by
drift
wood
forming
the
nucleus
of
possibly
some
future
island
in
order
to
save
coal
as
it
was
impossible
to
get
that
fuel
at
any
point
to
be
touched
during
the
expedition
a
look
out
was
kept
for
a
wood
pile
on
rounding
a
point
a
pirogue
skilfully
paddled
by
a
youth
shot
out
and
in
its
bow
was
a
girl
of
fifteen
of
fair
face
beautiful
black
eyes
and
demure
manners
the
boy
asked
for
a
paper
which
was
thrown
to
him
and
the
couple
pushed
their
tiny
craft
out
into
the
swell
of
the
boat
presently
a
little
girl
not
certainly
over
twelve
years
paddled
out
in
the
smallest
little
canoe
and
handled
it
with
all
the
deftness
of
an
old
voyageur
the
little
one
looked
more
like
an
indian
than
a
white
child
and
laughed
when
asked
if
she
were
afraid
she
had
been
raised
in
a
pirogue
and
could
go
anywhere
she
was
bound
out
to
pick
willow
leaves
for
the
stock
and
she
pointed
to
a
house
near
by
with
water
three
inches
deep
on
the
floors
at
its
back
door
was
moored
a
raft
about
thirty
feet
square
with
a
sort
of
fence
built
upon
it
and
inside
of
this
some
sixteen
cows
and
twenty
hogs
were
standing
the
family
did
not
complain
except
on
account
of
losing
their
stock
and
promptly
brought
a
supply
of
wood
in
a
flat
from
this
point
to
the
mississippi
river
fifteen
miles
there
is
not
a
spot
of
earth
above
water
and
to
the
westward
for
thirty
five
miles
there
is
nothing
but
the
river's
flood
black
river
had
risen
during
thursday
the
three
quarters
inches
and
was
going
up
at
night
still
as
we
progress
up
the
river
habitations
become
more
frequent
but
are
yet
still
miles
apart
nearly
all
of
them
are
deserted
and
the
out
houses
floated
off
to
add
to
the
gloom
almost
every
living
thing
seems
to
have
departed
and
not
a
whistle
of
a
bird
nor
the
bark
of
the
squirrel
can
be
heard
in
this
solitude
sometimes
a
morose
gar
will
throw
his
tail
aloft
and
disappear
in
the
river
but
beyond
this
everything
is
quiet
the
quiet
of
dissolution
down
the
river
floats
now
a
neatly
whitewashed
hen
house
then
a
cluster
of
neatly
split
fence
rails
or
a
door
and
a
bloated
carcass
solemnly
guarded
by
a
pair
of
buzzards
the
only
bird
to
be
seen
which
feast
on
the
carcass
as
it
bears
them
along
a
picture
frame
in
which
there
was
a
cheap
lithograph
of
a
soldier
on
horseback
as
it
floated
on
told
of
some
hearth
invaded
by
the
water
and
despoiled
of
this
ornament
at
dark
as
it
was
not
prudent
to
run
a
place
alongside
the
woods
was
hunted
and
to
a
tall
gum
tree
the
boat
was
made
fast
for
the
night
a
pretty
quarter
of
the
moon
threw
a
pleasant
light
over
forest
and
river
making
a
picture
that
would
be
a
delightful
piece
of
landscape
study
could
an
artist
only
hold
it
down
to
his
canvas
the
motion
of
the
engines
had
ceased
the
puffing
of
the
escaping
steam
was
stilled
and
the
enveloping
silence
closed
upon
us
and
such
silence
it
was
usually
in
a
forest
at
night
one
can
hear
the
piping
of
frogs
the
hum
of
insects
or
the
dropping
of
limbs
but
here
nature
was
dumb
the
dark
recesses
those
aisles
into
this
cathedral
gave
forth
no
sound
and
even
the
ripplings
of
the
current
die
away
at
daylight
friday
morning
all
hands
were
up
and
up
the
black
we
started
the
morning
was
a
beautiful
one
and
the
river
which
is
remarkably
straight
put
on
its
loveliest
garb
the
blossoms
of
the
haw
perfumed
the
air
deliciously
and
a
few
birds
whistled
blithely
along
the
banks
the
trees
were
larger
and
the
forest
seemed
of
older
growth
than
below
more
fields
were
passed
than
nearer
the
mouth
but
the
same
scene
presented
itself
smoke
houses
drifting
out
in
the
pastures
negro
quarters
anchored
in
confusion
against
some
oak
and
the
modest
residence
just
showing
its
eaves
above
water
the
sun
came
up
in
a
glory
of
carmine
and
the
trees
were
brilliant
in
their
varied
shades
of
green
not
a
foot
of
soil
is
to
be
seen
anywhere
and
the
water
is
apparently
growing
deeper
and
deeper
for
it
reaches
up
to
the
branches
of
the
largest
trees
all
along
the
bordering
willows
have
been
denuded
of
leaves
showing
how
long
the
people
have
been
at
work
gathering
this
fodder
for
their
animals
an
old
man
in
a
pirogue
was
asked
how
the
willow
leaves
agreed
with
his
cattle
he
stopped
in
his
work
and
with
an
ominous
shake
of
his
head
replied
well
sir
it
s
enough
to
keep
warmth
in
their
bodies
and
that's
all
we
expect
but
it's
hard
on
the
hogs
particularly
the
small
ones
they
is
dropping
off
powerful
fast
but
what
can
you
do
it
s
all
we've
got
at
thirty
miles
above
the
mouth
of
black
river
the
water
extends
from
natchez
on
the
mississippi
across
to
the
pine
hills
of
louisiana
a
distance
of
seventy
three
miles
and
there
is
hardly
a
spot
that
is
not
ten
feet
under
it
the
tendency
of
the
current
up
the
black
is
toward
the
west
in
fact
so
much
is
this
the
case
the
waters
of
red
river
have
been
driven
down
from
toward
the
calcasieu
country
and
the
waters
of
the
black
enter
the
red
some
fifteen
miles
above
the
mouth
of
the
former
a
thing
never
before
seen
by
even
the
oldest
steamboatmen
the
water
now
in
sight
of
us
is
entirely
from
the
mississippi
up
to
trinity
or
rather
troy
which
is
but
a
short
distance
below
the
people
have
nearly
all
moved
out
those
remaining
having
enough
for
their
present
personal
needs
their
cattle
though
are
suffering
and
dying
off
quite
fast
as
the
confinement
on
rafts
and
the
food
they
get
breeds
disease
after
a
short
stop
we
started
and
soon
came
to
a
section
where
there
were
many
open
fields
and
cabins
thickly
scattered
about
here
were
seen
more
pictures
of
distress
on
the
inside
of
the
houses
the
inmates
had
built
on
boxes
a
scaffold
on
which
they
placed
the
furniture
the
bed
posts
were
sawed
off
on
top
as
the
ceiling
was
not
more
than
four
feet
from
the
improvised
floor
the
buildings
looked
very
insecure
and
threatened
every
moment
to
float
off
near
the
houses
were
cattle
standing
breast
high
in
the
water
perfectly
impassive
they
did
not
move
in
their
places
but
stood
patiently
waiting
for
help
to
come
the
sight
was
a
distressing
one
and
the
poor
creatures
will
be
sure
to
die
unless
speedily
rescued
cattle
differ
from
horses
in
this
peculiar
quality
a
horse
after
finding
no
relief
comes
will
swim
off
in
search
of
food
whereas
a
beef
will
stand
in
its
tracks
until
with
exhaustion
it
drops
in
the
water
and
drowns
at
half
past
twelve
o'clock
a
hail
was
given
from
a
flat
boat
inside
the
line
of
the
bank
rounding
to
we
ran
alongside
and
general
york
stepped
aboard
he
was
just
then
engaged
in
getting
off
stock
and
welcomed
the
times
democrat
boat
heartily
as
he
said
there
was
much
need
for
her
he
said
that
the
distress
was
not
exaggerated
in
the
least
people
were
in
a
condition
it
was
difficult
even
for
one
to
imagine
the
water
was
so
high
there
was
great
danger
of
their
houses
being
swept
away
it
had
already
risen
so
high
that
it
was
approaching
the
eaves
and
when
it
reaches
this
point
there
is
always
imminent
risk
of
their
being
swept
away
if
this
occurs
there
will
be
great
loss
of
life
the
general
spoke
of
the
gallant
work
of
many
of
the
people
in
their
attempts
to
save
their
stock
but
thought
that
fully
twenty
five
per
cent
had
perished
already
twenty
five
hundred
people
had
received
rations
from
troy
on
black
river
and
he
had
towed
out
a
great
many
cattle
but
a
very
great
quantity
remained
and
were
in
dire
need
the
water
was
now
eighteen
inches
higher
than
in
and
there
was
no
land
between
vidalia
and
the
hills
of
catahoula
at
two
o'clock
the
susie
reached
troy
sixty
five
miles
above
the
mouth
of
black
river
here
on
the
left
comes
in
little
river
just
beyond
that
the
ouachita
and
on
the
right
the
tensas
these
three
rivers
form
the
black
river
troy
or
a
portion
of
it
is
situated
on
and
around
three
large
indian
mounds
circular
in
shape
which
rise
above
the
present
water
about
twelve
feet
they
are
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
diameter
and
are
about
two
hundred
yards
apart
the
houses
are
all
built
between
these
mounds
and
hence
are
all
flooded
to
a
depth
of
eighteen
inches
on
their
floors
these
elevations
built
by
the
aborigines
hundreds
of
years
ago
are
the
only
points
of
refuge
for
miles
when
we
arrived
we
found
them
crowded
with
stock
all
of
which
was
thin
and
hardly
able
to
stand
up
they
were
mixed
together
sheep
hogs
horses
mules
and
cattle
one
of
these
mounds
has
been
used
for
many
years
as
the
grave
yard
and
to
day
we
saw
attenuated
cows
lying
against
the
marble
tomb
stones
chewing
their
cud
in
contentment
after
a
meal
of
corn
furnished
by
general
york
here
as
below
the
remarkable
skill
of
the
women
and
girls
in
the
management
of
the
smaller
pirogues
was
noticed
children
were
paddling
about
in
these
most
ticklish
crafts
with
all
the
nonchalance
of
adepts
general
york
has
put
into
operation
a
perfect
system
in
regard
to
furnishing
relief
he
makes
a
personal
inspection
of
the
place
where
it
is
asked
sees
what
is
necessary
to
be
done
and
then
having
two
boats
chartered
with
flats
sends
them
promptly
to
the
place
when
the
cattle
are
loaded
and
towed
to
the
pine
hills
and
uplands
of
catahoula
he
has
made
troy
his
headquarters
and
to
this
point
boats
come
for
their
supply
of
feed
for
cattle
on
the
opposite
side
of
little
river
which
branches
to
the
left
out
of
black
and
between
it
and
the
ouachita
is
situated
the
town
of
trinity
which
is
hourly
threatened
with
destruction
it
is
much
lower
than
troy
and
the
water
is
eight
and
nine
feet
deep
in
the
houses
a
strong
current
sweeps
through
it
and
it
is
remarkable
that
all
of
its
houses
have
not
gone
before
the
residents
of
both
troy
and
trinity
have
been
cared
for
yet
some
of
their
stock
have
to
be
furnished
with
food
as
soon
as
the
susie
reached
troy
she
was
turned
over
to
general
york
and
placed
at
his
disposition
to
carry
out
the
work
of
relief
more
rapidly
nearly
all
her
supplies
were
landed
on
one
of
the
mounds
to
lighten
her
and
she
was
headed
down
stream
to
relieve
those
below
at
tom
hooper's
place
a
few
miles
from
troy
a
large
flat
with
about
fifty
head
of
stock
on
board
was
taken
in
tow
the
animals
were
fed
and
soon
regained
some
strength
to
day
we
go
on
little
river
where
the
suffering
is
greatest
down
black
river
saturday
evening
march
we
started
down
black
river
quite
early
under
the
direction
of
general
york
to
bring
out
what
stock
could
be
reached
going
down
river
a
flat
in
tow
was
left
in
a
central
locality
and
from
there
men
poled
her
back
in
the
rear
of
plantations
picking
up
the
animals
wherever
found
in
the
loft
of
a
gin
house
there
were
seventeen
head
found
and
after
a
gangway
was
built
they
were
led
down
into
the
flat
without
difficulty
taking
a
skiff
with
the
general
your
reporter
was
pulled
up
to
a
little
house
of
two
rooms
in
which
the
water
was
standing
two
feet
on
the
floors
in
one
of
the
large
rooms
were
huddled
the
horses
and
cows
of
the
place
while
in
the
other
the
widow
taylor
and
her
son
were
seated
on
a
scaffold
raised
on
the
floor
one
or
two
dug
outs
were
drifting
about
in
the
roam
ready
to
be
put
in
service
at
any
time
when
the
flat
was
brought
up
the
side
of
the
house
was
cut
away
as
the
only
means
of
getting
the
animals
out
and
the
cattle
were
driven
on
board
the
boat
general
york
in
this
as
in
every
case
inquired
if
the
family
desired
to
leave
informing
them
that
major
burke
of
the
times
democrat
has
sent
the
susie
up
for
that
purpose
mrs
taylor
said
she
thanked
major
burke
but
she
would
try
and
hold
out
the
remarkable
tenacity
of
the
people
here
to
their
homes
is
beyond
all
comprehension
just
below
at
a
point
sixteen
miles
from
troy
information
was
received
that
the
house
of
mr
tom
ellis
was
in
danger
and
his
family
were
all
in
it
we
steamed
there
immediately
and
a
sad
picture
was
presented
looking
out
of
the
half
of
the
window
left
above
water
was
mrs
ellis
who
is
in
feeble
health
whilst
at
the
door
were
her
seven
children
the
oldest
not
fourteen
years
one
side
of
the
house
was
given
up
to
the
work
animals
some
twelve
head
besides
hogs
in
the
next
room
the
family
lived
the
water
coming
within
two
inches
of
the
bed
rail
the
stove
was
below
water
and
the
cooking
was
done
on
a
fire
on
top
of
it
the
house
threatened
to
give
way
at
any
moment
one
end
of
it
was
sinking
and
in
fact
the
building
looked
a
mere
shell
as
the
boat
rounded
to
mr
ellis
came
out
in
a
dug
out
and
general
york
told
him
that
he
had
come
to
his
relief
that
the
times
democrat
boat
was
at
his
service
and
would
remove
his
family
at
once
to
the
hills
and
on
monday
a
flat
would
take
out
his
stock
as
until
that
time
they
would
be
busy
notwithstanding
the
deplorable
situation
himself
and
family
were
in
mr
ellis
did
not
want
to
leave
he
said
he
thought
he
would
wait
until
monday
and
take
the
risk
of
his
house
falling
the
children
around
the
door
looked
perfectly
contented
seeming
to
care
little
for
the
danger
they
were
in
these
are
but
two
instances
of
the
many
after
weeks
of
privation
and
suffering
people
still
cling
to
their
houses
and
leave
only
when
there
is
not
room
between
the
water
and
the
ceiling
to
build
a
scaffold
on
which
to
stand
it
seemed
to
be
incomprehensible
yet
the
love
for
the
old
place
was
stronger
than
that
for
safety
after
leaving
the
ellis
place
the
next
spot
touched
at
was
the
oswald
place
here
the
flat
was
towed
alongside
the
gin
house
where
there
were
fifteen
head
standing
in
water
and
yet
as
they
stood
on
scaffolds
their
heads
were
above
the
top
of
the
entrance
it
was
found
impossible
to
get
them
out
without
cutting
away
a
portion
of
the
front
and
so
axes
were
brought
into
requisition
and
a
gap
made
after
much
labor
the
horses
and
mules
were
securely
placed
on
the
flat
at
each
place
we
stop
there
are
always
three
four
or
more
dug
outs
arriving
bringing
information
of
stock
in
other
places
in
need
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
a
great
many
had
driven
a
part
of
their
stock
to
the
hills
some
time
ago
there
yet
remains
a
large
quantity
which
general
york
who
is
working
with
indomitable
energy
will
get
landed
in
the
pine
hills
by
tuesday
all
along
black
river
the
susie
has
been
visited
by
scores
of
planters
whose
tales
are
the
repetition
of
those
already
heard
of
suffering
and
loss
an
old
planter
who
has
lived
on
the
river
since
said
there
never
was
such
a
rise
and
he
was
satisfied
more
than
one
quarter
of
the
stock
has
been
lost
luckily
the
people
cared
first
for
their
work
stock
and
when
they
could
find
it
horses
and
mules
were
housed
in
a
place
of
safety
the
rise
which
still
continues
and
was
two
inches
last
night
compels
them
to
get
them
out
to
the
hills
hence
it
is
that
the
work
of
general
york
is
of
such
a
great
value
from
daylight
to
late
at
night
he
is
going
this
way
and
that
cheering
by
his
kindly
words
and
directing
with
calm
judgment
what
is
to
be
done
one
unpleasant
story
of
a
certain
merchant
in
new
orleans
is
told
all
along
the
river
it
appears
for
some
years
past
the
planters
have
been
dealing
with
this
individual
and
many
of
them
had
balances
in
his
hands
when
the
overflow
came
they
wrote
for
coffee
for
meal
and
in
fact
for
such
little
necessities
as
were
required
no
response
to
these
letters
came
and
others
were
written
and
yet
these
old
customers
with
plantations
under
water
were
refused
even
what
was
necessary
to
sustain
life
it
is
needless
to
say
he
is
not
popular
now
on
back
river
the
hills
spoken
of
as
the
place
of
refuge
for
the
people
and
stock
on
black
river
are
in
catahoula
parish
twenty
four
miles
from
black
river
after
filling
the
flat
with
cattle
we
took
on
board
the
family
of
t
s
hooper
seven
in
number
who
could
not
longer
remain
in
their
dwelling
and
we
are
now
taking
them
up
little
river
to
the
hills
the
flood
still
rising
troy
march
noon
the
flood
here
is
rising
about
three
and
a
half
inches
every
twenty
four
hours
and
rains
have
set
in
which
will
increase
this
general
york
feels
now
that
our
efforts
ought
to
be
directed
towards
saving
life
as
the
increase
of
the
water
has
jeopardized
many
houses
we
intend
to
go
up
the
tensas
in
a
few
minutes
and
then
we
will
return
and
go
down
black
river
to
take
off
families
there
is
a
lack
of
steam
transportation
here
to
meet
the
emergency
the
general
has
three
boats
chartered
with
flats
in
tow
but
the
demand
for
these
to
tow
out
stock
is
greater
than
they
can
meet
with
promptness
all
are
working
night
and
day
and
the
susie
hardly
stops
for
more
than
an
hour
anywhere
the
rise
has
placed
trinity
in
a
dangerous
plight
and
momentarily
it
is
expected
that
some
of
the
houses
will
float
off
troy
is
a
little
higher
yet
all
are
in
the
water
reports
have
come
in
that
a
woman
and
child
have
been
washed
away
below
here
and
two
cabins
floated
off
their
occupants
are
the
same
who
refused
to
come
off
day
before
yesterday
one
would
not
believe
the
utter
passiveness
of
the
people
as
yet
no
news
has
been
received
of
the
steamer
delia
which
is
supposed
to
be
the
one
sunk
in
yesterday's
storm
on
lake
catahoula
she
is
due
here
now
but
has
not
arrived
even
the
mail
here
is
most
uncertain
and
this
i
send
by
skiff
to
natchez
to
get
it
to
you
it
is
impossible
to
get
accurate
data
as
to
past
crops
etc
as
those
who
know
much
about
the
matter
have
gone
and
those
who
remain
are
not
well
versed
in
the
production
of
this
section
general
york
desires
me
to
say
that
the
amount
of
rations
formerly
sent
should
be
duplicated
and
sent
at
once
it
is
impossible
to
make
any
estimate
for
the
people
are
fleeing
to
the
hills
so
rapid
is
the
rise
the
residents
here
are
in
a
state
of
commotion
that
can
only
be
appreciated
when
seen
and
complete
demoralization
has
set
in
if
rations
are
drawn
for
any
particular
section
hereabouts
they
would
not
be
certain
to
be
distributed
so
everything
should
be
sent
to
troy
as
a
center
and
the
general
will
have
it
properly
disposed
of
he
has
sent
for
one
hundred
tents
and
if
all
go
to
the
hills
who
are
in
motion
now
two
hundred
will
be
required
appendix
b
the
mississippi
river
commission
the
condition
of
this
rich
valley
of
the
lower
mississippi
immediately
after
and
since
the
war
constituted
one
of
the
disastrous
effects
of
war
most
to
be
deplored
fictitious
property
in
slaves
was
not
only
righteously
destroyed
but
very
much
of
the
work
which
had
depended
upon
the
slave
labor
was
also
destroyed
or
greatly
impaired
especially
the
levee
system
it
might
have
been
expected
by
those
who
have
not
investigated
the
subject
that
such
important
improvements
as
the
construction
and
maintenance
of
the
levees
would
have
been
assumed
at
once
by
the
several
states
but
what
can
the
state
do
where
the
people
are
under
subjection
to
rates
of
interest
ranging
from
to
per
cent
and
are
also
under
the
necessity
of
pledging
their
crops
in
advance
even
of
planting
at
these
rates
for
the
privilege
of
purchasing
all
of
their
supplies
at
per
cent

it
has
needed
but
little
attention
to
make
it
perfectly
obvious

undertaken
at
all
must

by

the
river
must
be
treated
as

its

cannot

system
of
administration
neither
are
the
states

interested
competent
to
combine
among
themselves
for
the
necessary
operations
the
work
must
begin
far
up
the
river
at

as
far
as
cairo
if
not
beyond
and
must
be
conducted
upon
a
consistent
general
plan
throughout
the
course
of

it
does
not
need
technical
or
scientific
knowledge
to
comprehend
the
elements
of
the
case
if
one
will
give
a
little
time
and
attention
to
the
subject
and
when
a
mississippi
river
commission
has
been
constituted
as
the
existing
commission
is
of
thoroughly
able
men
of
different
walks
in
life
may
it
not
be
suggested
that
their
verdict
in
the
case
should
be
accepted
as
conclusive
so
far
as
any
a
priori
theory
of
construction
or
control
can
be
considered
conclusive
it
should
be
remembered
that
upon
this
board
are
general
gilmore
general
comstock
and
general
suter
of
the
united

engineers
professor
henry

the

whose
success
with

is
a

of
his
competency
and

of

it
would
be
presumption
on
the
part
of
any
single
man
however
skilled
to
contest
the
judgment
of
such
a
board
as
this
the
method
of
improvement
proposed
by
the
commission
is
at
once
in
accord
with
the
results
of
engineering
experience
and
with
observations
of
nature
where
meeting
our
wants
as
in
nature
the
growth
of
trees
and
their
proneness
where
undermined
to
fall
across
the
slope
and
support
the
bank
secures
at
some
points
a
fair
depth
of
channel
and
some
degree
of
permanence
so
in
the
project
of
the
engineer
the
use
of
timber
and
brush
and
the
encouragement
of
forest
growth
are
the
main
features
it
is
proposed
to
reduce
the
width
where
excessive
by
brushwood
dykes
at
first
low
but
raised
higher
and
higher
as
the
mud
of
the
river
settles
under
their
shelter
and
finally
slope
them
back
at
the
angle
upon
which
willows
will
grow
freely
in
this
work
there
are
many
details
connected
with
the
forms
of
these
shelter
dykes
their
arrangements
so
as
to
present
a
series
of
settling
basins
etc
a
description
of
which
would
only
complicate
the
conception
through
the
larger
part
of
the
river
works
of
contraction
will
not
be
required
but
nearly
all
the
banks
on
the
concave
side
of
the
beds
must
be
held
against
the
wear
of
the
stream
and
much
of
the
opposite
banks
defended
at
critical
points
the
works
having
in
view
this
conservative
object
may
be
generally
designated
works
of
revetment
and
these
also
will
be
largely
of
brushwood
woven
in
continuous
carpets
or
twined
into
wire
netting
this
veneering
process
has
been
successfully
employed
on
the
missouri
river
and
in
some
cases
they
have
so
covered
themselves
with
sediments
and
have
become
so
overgrown
with
willows
that
they
may
be
regarded
as
permanent
in
securing
these
mats
rubble
stone
is
to
be
used
in
small
quantities
and
in
some
instances
the
dressed
slope
between
high
and
low
river
will
have
to
be
more
or
less
paved
with
stone
any
one
who
has
been
on
the
rhine
will
have
observed
operations
not
unlike
those
to
which
we
have
just
referred
and
indeed
most
of
the
rivers
of
europe
flowing
among
their
own
alluvia
have
required
similar
treatment
in
the
interest
of
navigation
and
agriculture
the
levee
is
the
crowning
work
of
bank
revetment
although
not
necessarily
in
immediate
connection
it
may
be
set
back
a
short
distance
from
the
revetted
bank
but
it
is
in
effect
the
requisite
parapet
the
flood
river
and
the
low
river
cannot
be
brought
into
register
and
compelled
to
unite
in
the
excavation
of
a
single
permanent
channel
without
a
complete
control
of
all
the
stages
and
even
the
abnormal
rise
must
be
provided
against
because
this
would
endanger
the
levee
and
once
in
force
behind
the
works
of
revetment
would
tear
them
also
away
under
the
general
principle
that
the
local
slope
of
a
river
is
the
result
and
measure
of
the
resistance
of
its
bed
it
is
evident
that
a
narrow
and
deep
stream
should
have
less
slope
because
it
has
less
frictional
surface
in
proportion
to
capacity
i
e
less
perimeter
in
proportion
to
area
of
cross
section
the
ultimate
effect
of
levees
and
revetments
confining
the
floods
and
bringing
all
the
stages
of
the
river
into
register
is
to
deepen
the
channel
and
let
down
the
slope
the
first
effect
of
the
levees
is
to
raise
the
surface
but
this
by
inducing
greater
velocity
of
flow
inevitably
causes
an
enlargement
of
section
and
if
this
enlargement
is
prevented
from
being
made
at
the
expense
of
the
banks
the
bottom
must
give
way
and
the
form
of
the
waterway
be
so
improved
as
to
admit
this
flow
with
less
rise
the
actual
experience
with
levees
upon
the
mississippi
river
with
no
attempt
to
hold
the
banks
has
been
favorable
and
no
one
can
doubt
upon
the
evidence
furnished
in
the
reports
of
the
commission
that
if
the
earliest
levees
had
been
accompanied
by
revetment
of
banks
and
made
complete
we
should
have
to
day
a
river
navigable
at
low
water
and
an
adjacent
country
safe
from
inundation
of
course
it
would
be
illogical
to
conclude
that
the
constrained
river
can
ever
lower
its
flood
slope
so
as
to
make
levees
unnecessary
but
it
is
believed
that
by
this
lateral
constraint
the
river
as
a
conduit
may
be
so
improved
in
form
that
even
those
rare
floods
which
result
from
the
coincident
rising
of
many
tributaries
will
find
vent
without
destroying
levees
of
ordinary
height
that
the
actual
capacity
of
a
channel
through
alluvium
depends
upon
its
service
during
floods
has
been
often
shown
but
this
capacity
does
not
include
anomalous
but
recurrent
floods
it
is
hardly
worth
while
to
consider
the
projects
for
relieving
the
mississippi
river
floods
by
creating
new
outlets
since
these
sensational
propositions
have
commended
themselves
only
to
unthinking
minds
and
have
no
support
among
engineers
were
the
river
bed
cast
iron
a
resort
to
openings
for
surplus
waters
might
be
a
necessity
but
as
the
bottom
is
yielding
and
the
best
form
of
outlet
is
a
single
deep
channel
as
realizing
the
least
ratio
of
perimeter
to
area
of
cross
section
there
could
not
well
be
a
more
unphilosophical
method
of
treatment
than
the
multiplication
of
avenues
of
escape
in
the
foregoing
statement
the
attempt
has
been
made
to
condense
in
as
limited
a
space
as
the
importance
of
the
subject
would
permit
the
general
elements
of
the
problem
and
the
general
features
of
the
proposed
method
of
improvement
which
has
been
adopted
by
the
mississippi
river
commission
the
writer
cannot
help
feeling
that
it
is
somewhat
presumptuous
on
his
part
to
attempt
to
present
the
facts
relating
to
an
enterprise
which
calls
for
the
highest
scientific
skill
but
it
is
a
matter
which
interests
every
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
is
one
of
the
methods
of
reconstruction
which
ought
to
be
approved
it
is
a
war
claim
which
implies
no
private
gain
and
no
compensation
except
for
one
of
the
cases
of
destruction
incident
to
war
which
may
well
be
repaired
by
the
people
of
the
whole
country

appendix
c
reception
of
captain
basil
hall's
book
in
the
united
states
having
now
arrived
nearly
at
the
end
of
our
travels
i
am
induced
ere
i
conclude
again
to
mention
what
i
consider
as
one
of
the
most
remarkable
traits
in
the
national
character
of
the
americans
namely
their
exquisite
sensitiveness
and
soreness
respecting
everything
said
or
written
concerning
them
of
this
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
example
i
can
give
is
the
effect
produced
on
nearly
every
class
of
readers
by
the
appearance
of
captain
basil
hall's
travels
in
north
america
in
fact
it
was
a
sort
of
moral
earthquake
and
the
vibration
it
occasioned
through
the
nerves
of
the
republic
from
one
corner
of
the
union
to
the
other
was
by
no
means
over
when
i
left
the
country
in
july
a
couple
of
years
after
the
shock
i
was
in
cincinnati
when
these
volumes
came
out
but
it
was
not
till
july
that
i
procured
a
copy
of
them
one
bookseller
to
whom
i
applied
told
me
that
he
had
had
a
few
copies
before
he
understood
the
nature
of
the
work
but
that
after
becoming
acquainted
with
it
nothing
should
induce
him
to
sell
another
other
persons
of
his
profession
must
however
have
been
less
scrupulous
for
the
book
was
read
in
city
town
village
and
hamlet
steamboat
and
stage
coach
and
a
sort
of
war
whoop
was
sent
forth
perfectly
unprecedented
in
my
recollection
upon
any
occasion
whatever
an
ardent
desire
for
approbation
and
a
delicate
sensitiveness
under
censure
have
always
i
believe
been
considered
as
amiable
traits
of
character
but
the
condition
into
which
the
appearance
of
captain
hall's
work
threw
the
republic
shows
plainly
that
these
feelings
if
carried
to
excess
produce
a
weakness
which
amounts
to
imbecility
it
was
perfectly
astonishing
to
hear
men
who
on
other
subjects
were
of
some
judgment
utter
their
opinions
upon
this
i
never
heard
of
any
instance
in
which
the
commonsense
generally
found
in
national
criticism
was
so
overthrown
by
passion
i
do
not
speak
of
the
want
of
justice
and
of
fair
and
liberal
interpretation
these
perhaps
were
hardly
to
be
expected
other
nations
have
been
called
thin
skinned
but
the
citizens
of
the
union
have
apparently
no
skins
at
all
they
wince
if
a
breeze
blows
over
them
unless
it
be
tempered
with
adulation
it
was
not
therefore
very
surprising
that
the
acute
and
forcible
observations
of
a
traveler
they
knew
would
be
listened
to
should
be
received
testily
the
extraordinary
features
of
the
business
were
first
the
excess
of
the
rage
into
which
they
lashed
themselves
and
secondly
the
puerility
of
the
inventions
by
which
they
attempted
to
account
for
the
severity
with
which
they
fancied
they
had
been
treated
not
content
with
declaring
that
the
volumes
contained
no
word
of
truth
from
beginning
to
end
which
is
an
assertion
i
heard
made
very
nearly
as
often
as
they
were
mentioned
the
whole
country
set
to
work
to
discover
the
causes
why
captain
hall
had
visited
the
united
states
and
why
he
had
published
his
book
i
have
heard
it
said
with
as
much
precision
and
gravity
as
if
the
statement
had
been
conveyed
by
an
official
report
that
captain
hall
had
been
sent
out
by
the
british
government
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
checking
the
growing
admiration
of
england
for
the
government
of
the
united
states
that
it
was
by
a
commission
from
the
treasury
he
had
come
and
that
it
was
only
in
obedience
to
orders
that
he
had
found
anything
to
object
to
i
do
not
give
this
as
the
gossip
of
a
coterie
i
am
persuaded
that
it
is
the
belief
of
a
very
considerable
portion
of
the
country
so
deep
is
the
conviction
of
this
singular
people
that
they
cannot
be
seen
without
being
admired
that
they
will
not
admit
the
possibility
that
any
one
should
honestly
and
sincerely
find
aught
to
disapprove
in
them
or
their
country
the
american
reviews
are
many
of
them
i
believe
well
known
in
england
i
need
not
therefore
quote
them
here
but
i
sometimes
wondered
that
they
none
of
them
ever
thought
of
translating
obadiah's
curse
into
classic
american
if
they
had
done
so
on
placing
he
basil
hall
between
brackets
instead
of
he
obadiah
it
would
have
saved
them
a
world
of
trouble
i
can
hardly
describe
the
curiosity
with
which
i
sat
down
at
length
to
peruse
these
tremendous
volumes
still
less
can
i
do
justice
to
my
surprise
at
their
contents
to
say
that
i
found
not
one
exaggerated
statement
throughout
the
work
is
by
no
means
saying
enough
it
is
impossible
for
any
one
who
knows
the
country
not
to
see
that
captain
hall
earnestly
sought
out
things
to
admire
and
commend
when
he
praises
it
is
with
evident
pleasure
and
when
he
finds
fault
it
is
with
evident
reluctance
and
restraint
excepting
where
motives
purely
patriotic
urge
him
to
state
roundly
what
it
is
for
the
benefit
of
his
country
should
be
known
in
fact
captain
hall
saw
the
country
to
the
greatest
possible
advantage
furnished
of
course
with
letters
of
introduction
to
the
most
distinguished
individuals
and
with
the
still
more
influential
recommendation
of
his
own
reputation
he
was
received
in
full
drawing
room
style
and
state
from
one
end
of
the
union
to
the
other
he
saw
the
country
in
full
dress
and
had
little
or
no
opportunity
of
judging
of
it
unhouselled
unanointed
unannealed
with
all
its
imperfections
on
its
head
as
i
and
my
family
too
often
had
captain
hall
had
certainly
excellent
opportunities
of
making
himself
acquainted
with
the
form
of
the
government
and
the
laws
and
of
receiving
moreover
the
best
oral
commentary
upon
them
in
conversation
with
the
most
distinguished
citizens
of
these
opportunities
he
made
excellent
use
nothing
important
met
his
eye
which
did
not
receive
that
sort
of
analytical
attention
which
an
experienced
and
philosophical
traveler
alone
can
give
this
has
made
his
volumes
highly
interesting
and
valuable
but
i
am
deeply
persuaded
that
were
a
man
of
equal
penetration
to
visit
the
united
states
with
no
other
means
of
becoming
acquainted
with
the
national
character
than
the
ordinary
working
day
intercourse
of
life
he
would
conceive
an
infinitely
lower
idea
of
the
moral
atmosphere
of
the
country
than
captain
hall
appears
to
have
done
and
the
internal
conviction
on
my
mind
is
strong
that
if
captain
hall
had
not
placed
a
firm
restraint
on
himself
he
must
have
given
expression
to
far
deeper
indignation
than
any
he
has
uttered
against
many
points
in
the
american
character
with
which
he
shows
from
other
circumstances
that
he
was
well
acquainted
his
rule
appears
to
have
been
to
state
just
so
much
of
the
truth
as
would
leave
on
the
mind
of
his
readers
a
correct
impression
at
the
least
cost
of
pain
to
the
sensitive
folks
he
was
writing
about
he
states
his
own
opinions
and
feelings
and
leaves
it
to
be
inferred
that
he
has
good
grounds
for
adopting
them
but
he
spares
the
americans
the
bitterness
which
a
detail
of
the
circumstances
would
have
produced
if
any
one
chooses
to
say
that
some
wicked
antipathy
to
twelve
millions
of
strangers
is
the
origin
of
my
opinion
i
must
bear
it
and
were
the
question
one
of
mere
idle
speculation
i
certainly
would
not
court
the
abuse
i
must
meet
for
stating
it
but
it
is
not
so
the
candor
which
he
expresses
and
evidently
feels
they
mistake
for
irony
or
totally
distrust
his
unwillingness
to
give
pain
to
persons
from
whom
he
has
received
kindness
they
scornfully
reject
as
affectation
and
although
they
must
know
right
well
in
their
own
secret
hearts
how
infinitely
more
they
lay
at
his
mercy
than
he
has
chosen
to
betray
they
pretend
even
to
themselves
that
he
has
exaggerated
the
bad
points
of
their
character
and
institutions
whereas
the
truth
is
that
he
has
let
them
off
with
a
degree
of
tenderness
which
may
be
quite
suitable
for
him
to
exercise
however
little
merited
while
at
the
same
time
he
has
most
industriously
magnified
their
merits
whenever
he
could
possibly
find
anything
favorable

barbs
in
the
ground
telling
his
sister
where
they
had
been
placed
every
morning
she
would
go
in
search
and
never
fail
of
finding
each
stuck
through
the
heart
of
a
deer
she
had
then
only
to
drag
them
into
the
lodge
and
prepare
their
food
thus
she
lived
till
she
attained
womanhood
when
one
day
her
brother
whose
name
was
iamo
said
to
her
sister
the
time
is
at
hand
when
you
will
be
ill
listen
to
my
advice
if
you
do
not
it
will
probably
be
the
cause
of
my
death
take
the
implements
with
which
we
kindle
our
fires
go
some
distance
from
our
lodge
and
build
a
separate
fire
when
you
are
in
want
of
food
i
will
tell
you
where
to
find
it
you
must
cook
for
yourself
and
i
will
for
myself
when
you
are
ill
do
not
attempt
to
come
near
the
lodge
or
bring
any
of
the
utensils
you
use
be
sure
always
to
fasten
to
your
belt
the
implements
you
need
for
you
do
not
know
when
the
time
will
come
as
for
myself
i
must
do
the
best
i
can
his
sister
promised
to
obey
him
in
all
he
had
said
shortly
after
her
brother
had
cause
to
go
from
home
she
was
alone
in
her
lodge
combing
her
hair
she
had
just
untied
the
belt
to
which
the
implements
were
fastened
when
suddenly
the
event
to
which
her
brother
had
alluded
occurred
she
ran
out
of
the
lodge
but
in
her
haste
forgot
the
belt
afraid
to
return
she
stood
for
some
time
thinking
finally
she
decided
to
enter
the
lodge
and
get
it
for
thought
she
my
brother
is
not
at
home
and
i
will
stay
but
a
moment
to
catch
hold
of
it
she
went
back
running
in
suddenly
she
caught
hold
of
it
and
was
coming
out
when
her
brother
came
in
sight
he
knew
what
was
the
matter
oh
he
said
did
i
not
tell
you
to
take
care
but
now
you
have
killed
me
she
was
going
on
her
way
but
her
brother
said
to
her
what
can
you
do
there
now
the
accident
has
happened
go
in
and
stay
where
you
have
always
stayed
and
what
will
become
of
you
you
have
killed
me
he
then
laid
aside
his
hunting
dress
and
accoutrements
and
soon
after
both
his
feet
began
to
turn
black
so
that
he
could
not
move
still
he
directed
his
sister
where
to
place
the
arrows
that
she
might
always
have
food
the
inflammation
continued
to
increase
and
had
now
reached
his
first
rib
and
he
said
sister
my
end
is
near
you
must
do
as
i
tell
you
you
see
my
medicine
sack
and
my
war
club
tied
to
it
it
contains
all
my
medicines
and
my
war
plumes
and
my
paints
of
all
colors
as
soon
as
the
inflammation
reaches
my
breast
you
will
take
my
war
club
it
has
a
sharp
point
and
you
will
cut
off
my
head
when
it
is
free
from
my
body
take
it
place
its
neck
in
the
sack
which
you
must
open
at
one
end
then
hang
it
up
in
its
former
place
do
not
forget
my
bow
and
arrows
one
of
the
last
you
will
take
to
procure
food
the
remainder
tie
in
my
sack
and
then
hang
it
up
so
that
i
can
look
towards
the
door
now
and
then
i
will
speak
to
you
but
not
often
his
sister
again
promised
to
obey
in
a
little
time
his
breast
was
affected
now
said
he
take
the
club
and
strike
off
my
head
she
was
afraid
but
he
told
her
to
muster
courage
strike
said
he
and
a
smile
was
on
his
face
mustering
all
her
courage
she
gave
the
blow
and
cut
off
the
head
now
said
the
head
place
me
where
i
told
you
and
fearfully
she
obeyed
it
in
all
its
commands
retaining
its
animation
it
looked
around
the
lodge
as
usual
and
it
would
command
its
sister
to
go
in
such
places
as
it
thought
would
procure
for
her
the
flesh
of
different
animals
she
needed
one
day
the
head
said
the
time
is
not
distant
when
i
shall
be
freed
from
this
situation
and
i
shall
have
to
undergo
many
sore
evils
so
the
superior
manito
decrees
and
i
must
bear
all
patiently
in
this
situation
we
must
leave
the
head
in
a
certain
part
of
the
country
was
a
village
inhabited
by
a
numerous
and
warlike
band
of
indians
in
this
village
was
a
family
of
ten
young
men
brothers
it
was
in
the
spring
of
the
year
that
the
youngest
of
these
blackened
his
face
and
fasted
his
dreams
were
propitious
having
ended
his
fast
he
went
secretly
for
his
brothers
at
night
so
that
none
in
the
village
could
overhear
or
find
out
the
direction
they
intended
to
go
though
their
drum
was
heard
yet
that
was
a
common
occurrence
having
ended
the
usual
formalities
he
told
how
favorable
his
dreams
were
and
that
he
had
called
them
together
to
know
if
they
would
accompany
him
in
a
war
excursion
they
all
answered
they
would
the
third
brother
from
the
eldest
noted
for
his
oddities
coming
up
with
his
war
club
when
his
brother
had
ceased
speaking
jumped
up
yes
said
he
i
will
go
and
this
will
be
the
way
i
will
treat
those
i
am
going
to
fight
and
he
struck
the
post
in
the
center
of
the
lodge
and
gave
a
yell
the
others
spoke
to
him
saying
slow
slow
mudjikewis
when
you
are
in
other
people's
lodges
so
he
sat
down
then
in
turn
they
took
the
drum
and
sang
their
songs
and
closed
with
a
feast
the
youngest
told
them
not
to
whisper
their
intention
to
their
wives
but
secretly
to
prepare
for
their
journey
they
all
promised
obedience
and
mudjikewis
was
the
first
to
say
so
the
time
for
their
departure
drew
near
word
was
given
to
assemble
on
a
certain
night
when
they
would
depart
immediately
mudjikewis
was
loud
in
his
demands
for
his
moccasins
several
times
his
wife
asked
him
the
reason
besides
said
she
you
have
a
good
pair
on
quick
quick
said
he
since
you
must
know
we
are
going
on
a
war
excursion
so
be
quick
he
thus
revealed
the
secret
that
night
they
met
and
started
the
snow
was
on
the
ground
and
they
traveled
all
night
lest
others
should
follow
them
when
it
was
daylight
the
leader
took
snow
and
made
a
ball
of
it
then
tossing
it
into
the
air
he
said
it
was
in
this
way
i
saw
snow
fall
in
a
dream
so
that
i
could
not
be
tracked
and
he
told
them
to
keep
close
to
each
other
for
fear
of
losing
themselves
as
the
snow
began
to
fall
in
very
large
flakes
near
as
they
walked
it
was
with
difficulty
they
could
see
each
other
the
snow
continued
falling
all
that
day
and
the
following
night
so
it
was
impossible
to
track
them
they
had
now
walked
for
several
days
and
mudjikewis
was
always
in
the
rear
one
day
running
suddenly
forward
he
gave
the
saw
saw
quan
footnote
whoop
and
struck
a
tree
with
his
war
club
and
it
broke
into
pieces
as
if
struck
with
lightning
brothers
said
he
this
will
be
the
way
i
will
serve
those
we
are
going
to
fight
the
leader
answered
slow
slow
mudjikewis
the
one
i
lead
you
to
is
not
to
be
thought
of
so
lightly
again
he
fell
back
and
thought
to
himself
what
what
who
can
this
be
he
is
leading
us
to
he
felt
fearful
and
was
silent
day
after
day
they
traveled
on
till
they
came
to
an
extensive
plain
on
the
borders
of
which
human
bones
were
bleaching
in
the
sun
the
leader
spoke
they
are
the
bones
of
those
who
have
gone
before
us
none
has
ever
yet
returned
to
tell
the
sad
tale
of
their
fate
again
mudjikewis
became
restless
and
running
forward
gave
the
accustomed
yell
advancing
to
a
large
rock
which
stood
above
the
ground
he
struck
it
and
it
fell
to
pieces
see
brothers
said
he
thus
will
i
treat
those
whom
we
are
going
to
fight
still
still
once
more
said
the
leader
he
to
whom
i
am
leading
you
is
not
to
be
compared
to
the
rock
mudjikewis
fell
back
thoughtful
saying
to
himself
i
wonder
who
this
can
be
that
he
is
going
to
attack
and
he
was
afraid
still
they
continued
to
see
the
remains
of
former
warriors
who
had
been
to
the
place
where
they
were
now
going
some
of
whom
had
retreated
as
far
back
as
the
place
where
they
first
saw
the
bones
beyond
which
no
one
had
ever
escaped
at
last
they
came
to
a
piece
of
rising
ground
from
which
they
plainly
distinguished
sleeping
on
a
distant
mountain
a
mammoth
bear
the
distance
between
them
was
very
great
but
the
size
of
the
animal
caused
him
to
be
plainly
seen
there
said
the
leader
it
is
he
to
whom
i
am
leading
you
here
our
troubles
will
commence
for
he
is
a
mishemokwa
and
a
manito
it
is
he
who
has
that
we
prize
so
dearly
i
e
wampum
to
obtain
which
the
warriors
whose
bones
we
saw
sacrificed
their
lives
you
must
not
be
fearful
be
manly
we
shall
find
him
asleep
then
the
leader
went
forward
and
touched
the
belt
around
the
animal's
neck
this
said
he
is
what
we
must
get
it
contains
the
wampum
then
they
requested
the
eldest
to
try
and
slip
the
belt
over
the
bear's
head
who
appeared
to
be
fast
asleep
as
he
was
not
in
the
least
disturbed
by
the
attempt
to
obtain
the
belt
all
their
efforts
were
in
vain
till
it
came
to
the
one
next
the
youngest
he
tried
and
the
belt
moved
nearly
over
the
monster's
head
but
he
could
get
it
no
farther
then
the
youngest
one
and
the
leader
made
his
attempt
and
succeeded
placing
it
on
the
back
of
the
oldest
he
said
now
we
must
run
and
off
they
started
when
one
became
fatigued
with
its
weight
another
would
relieve
him
thus
they
ran
till
they
had
passed
the
bones
of
all
former
warriors
and
were
some
distance
beyond
when
looking
back
they
saw
the
monster
slowly
rising
he
stood
some
time
before
he
missed
his
wampum
soon
they
heard
his
tremendous
howl
like
distant
thunder
slowly
filling
all
the
sky
and
then
they
heard
him
speak
and
say
who
can
it
be
that
has
dared
to
steal
my
wampum
earth
is
not
so
large
but
that
i
can
find
them
and
he
descended
from
the
hill
in
pursuit
as
if
convulsed
the
earth
shook
with
every
jump
he
made
very
soon
he
approached
the
party
they
however
kept
the
belt
exchanging
it
from
one
to
another
and
encouraging
each
other
but
he
gained
on
them
fast
brothers
said
the
leader
has
never
any
one
of
you
when
fasting
dreamed
of
some
friendly
spirit
who
would
aid
you
as
a
guardian
a
dead
silence
followed
well
said
he
fasting
i
dreamed
of
being
in
danger
of
instant
death
when
i
saw
a
small
lodge
with
smoke
curling
from
its
top
an
old
man
lived
in
it
and
i
dreamed
he
helped
me
and
may
it
be
verified
soon
he
said
running
forward
and
giving
the
peculiar
yell
and
a
howl
as
if
the
sounds
came
from
the
depths
of
his
stomach
and
what
is
called
checaudum
getting
upon
a
piece
of
rising
ground
behold
a
lodge
with
smoke
curling
from
its
top
appeared
this
gave
them
all
new
strength
and
they
ran
forward
and
entered
it
the
leader
spoke
to
the
old
man
who
sat
in
the
lodge
saying
nemesho
help
us
we
claim
your
protection
for
the
great
bear
will
kill
us
sit
down
and
eat
my
grandchildren
said
the
old
man
who
is
a
great
manito
said
he
there
is
none
but
me
but
let
me
look
and
he
opened
the
door
of
the
lodge
when
lo
at
a
little
distance
he
saw
the
enraged
animal
coming
on
with
slow
but
powerful
leaps
he
closed
the
door
yes
said
he
he
is
indeed
a
great
manito
my
grandchildren
you
will
be
the
cause
of
my
losing
my
life
you
asked
my
protection
and
i
granted
it
so
now
come
what
may
i
will
protect
you
when
the
bear
arrives
at
the
door
you
must
run
out
of
the
other
door
of
the
lodge
then
putting
his
hand
to
the
side
of
the
lodge
where
he
sat
he
brought
out
a
bag
which
he
opened
taking
out
two
small
black
dogs
he
placed
them
before
him
these
are
the
ones
i
use
when
i
fight
said
he
and
he
commenced
patting
with
both
hands
the
sides
of
one
of
them
and
he
began
to
swell
out
so
that
he
soon
filled
the
lodge
by
his
bulk
and
he
had
great
strong
teeth
when
he
attained
his
full
size
he
growled
and
from
that
moment
as
from
instinct
he
jumped
out
at
the
door
and
met
the
bear
who
in
another
leap
would
have
reached
the
lodge
a
terrible
combat
ensued
the
skies
rang
with
the
howls
of
the
fierce
monsters
the
remaining
dog
soon
took
the
field
the
brothers
at
the
onset
took
the
advice
of
the
old
man
and
escaped
through
the
opposite
side
of
the
lodge
they
had
not
proceeded
far
before
they
heard
the
dying
cry
of
one
of
the
dogs
and
soon
after
of
the
other
well
said
the
leader
the
old
man
will
share
their
fate
so
run
he
will
soon
be
after
us
they
started
with
fresh
vigor
for
they
had
received
food
from
the
old
man
but
very
soon
the
bear
came
in
sight
and
again
was
fast
gaining
upon
them
again
the
leader
asked
the
brothers
if
they
could
do
nothing
for
their
safety
all
were
silent
the
leader
running
forward
did
as
before
i
dreamed
he
cried
that
being
in
great
trouble
an
old
man
helped
me
who
was
a
manito
we
shall
soon
see
his
lodge
taking
courage
they
still
went
on
after
going
a
short
distance
they
saw
the
lodge
of
the
old
manito
they
entered
immediately
and
claimed
his
protection
telling
him
a
manito
was
after
them
the
old
man
setting
meat
before
them
said
eat
who
is
a
manito
there
is
no
manito
but
me
there
is
none
whom
i
fear
and
the
earth
trembled
as
the
monster
advanced
the
old
man
opened
the
door
and
saw
him
coming
he
shut
it
slowly
and
said
yes
my
grandchildren
you
have
brought
trouble
upon
me
procuring
his
medicine
sack
he
took
out
his
small
war
clubs
of
black
stone
and
told
the
young
men
to
run
through
the
other
side
of
the
lodge
as
he
handled
the
clubs
they
became
very
large
and
the
old
man
stepped
out
just
as
the
bear
reached
the
door
then
striking
him
with
one
of
the
clubs
it
broke
in
pieces
the
bear
stumbled
renewing
the
attempt
with
the
other
war
club
that
also
was
broken
but
the
bear
fell
senseless
each
blow
the
old
man
gave
him
sounded
like
a
clap
of
thunder
and
the
howls
of
the
bear
ran
along
till
they
filled
the
heavens
the
young
men
had
now
run
some
distance
when
they
looked
back
they
could
see
that
the
bear
was
recovering
from
the
blows
first
he
moved
his
paws
and
soon
they
saw
him
rise
on
his
feet
the
old
man
shared
the
fate
of
the
first
for
they
now
heard
his
cries
as
he
was
torn
in
pieces
again
the
monster
was
in
pursuit
and
fast
overtaking
them
not
yet
discouraged
the
young
men
kept
on
their
way
but
the
bear
was
now
so
close
that
the
leader
once
more
applied
to
his
brothers
but
they
could
do
nothing
well
said
he
my
dreams
will
soon
be
exhausted
after
this
i
have
but
one
more
he
advanced
invoking
his
guardian
spirit
to
aid
him
once
said
he
i
dreamed
that
being
sorely
pressed
i
came
to
a
large
lake
on
the
shore
of
which
was
a
canoe
partly
out
of
water
having
ten
paddles
all
in
readiness
do
not
fear
he
cried
we
shall
soon
get
it
and
so
it
was
even
as
he
had
said
coming
to
the
lake
they
saw
the
canoe
with
ten
paddles
and
immediately
they
embarked
scarcely
had
they
reached
the
center
of
the
lake
when
they
saw
the
bear
arrive
at
its
borders
lifting
himself
on
his
hind
legs
he
looked
all
around
then
he
waded
into
the
water
then
losing
his
footing
he
turned
back
and
commenced
making
the
circuit
of
the
lake
meantime
the
party
remained
stationary
in
the
center
to
watch
his
movements
he
traveled
all
around
till
at
last
he
came
to
the
place
from
whence
he
started
then
he
commenced
drinking
up
the
water
and
they
saw
the
current
fast
setting
in
towards
his
open
mouth
the
leader
encouraged
them
to
paddle
hard
for
the
opposite
shore
when
only
a
short
distance
from
land
the
current
had
increased
so
much
that
they
were
drawn
back
by
it
and
all
their
efforts
to
reach
it
were
in
vain
then
the
leader
again
spoke
telling
them
to
meet
their
fates
manfully
now
is
the
time
mudjikewis
said
he
to
show
your
prowess
take
courage
and
sit
at
the
bow
of
the
canoe
and
when
it
approaches
his
mouth
try
what
effect
your
club
will
have
on
his
head
he
obeyed
and
stood
ready
to
give
the
blow
while
the
leader
who
steered
directed
the
canoe
for
the
open
mouth
of
the
monster
rapidly
advancing
they
were
just
about
to
enter
his
mouth
when
mudjikewis
struck
him
a
tremendous
blow
on
the
head
and
gave
the
saw
saw
quan
the
bear's
limbs
doubled
under
him
and
he
fell
stunned
by
the
blow
but
before
mudjikewis
could
renew
it
the
monster
disgorged
all
the
water
he
had
drank
with
a
force
which
sent
the
canoe
with
great
velocity
to
the
opposite
shore
instantly
leaving
the
canoe
again
they
fled
and
on
they
went
till
they
were
completely
exhausted
the
earth
again
shook
and
soon
they
saw
the
monster
hard
after
them
their
spirits
drooped
and
they
felt
discouraged
the
leader
exerted
himself
by
actions
and
words
to
cheer
them
up
and
once
more
he
asked
them
if
they
thought
of
nothing
or
could
do
nothing
for
their
rescue
and
as
before
all
were
silent
then
he
said
this
is
the
last
time
i
can
apply
to
my
guardian
spirit
now
if
we
do
not
succeed
our
fates
are
decided
he
ran
forward
invoking
his
spirit
with
great
earnestness
and
gave
the
yell
we
shall
soon
arrive
said
he
to
his
brothers
at
the
place
where
my
last
guardian
spirit
dwells
in
him
i
place
great
confidence
do
not
do
not
be
afraid
or
your
limbs
will
be
fear
bound
we
shall
soon
reach
his
lodge
run
run
he
cried
returning
now
to
iamo
he
had
passed
all
the
time
in
the
same
condition
we
had
left
him
the
head
directing
his
sister
in
order
to
procure
food
where
to
place
the
magic
arrows
and
speaking
at
long
intervals
one
day
the
sister
saw
the
eyes
of
the
head
brighten
as
if
with
pleasure
at
last
it
spoke
oh
sister
it
said
in
what
a
pitiful
situation
you
have
been
the
cause
of
placing
me
soon
very
soon
a
party
of
young
men
will
arrive
and
apply
to
me
for
aid
but
alas
how
can
i
give
what
i
would
have
done
with
so
much
pleasure
nevertheless
take
two
arrows
and
place
them
where
you
have
been
in
the
habit
of
placing
the
others
and
have
meat
prepared
and
cooked
before
they
arrive
when
you
hear
them
coming
and
calling
on
my
name
go
out
and
say
alas
it
is
long
ago
that
an
accident
befell
him
i
was
the
cause
of
it
if
they
still
come
near
ask
them
in
and
set
meat
before
them
and
now
you
must
follow
my
directions
strictly
when
the
bear
is
near
go
out
and
meet
him
you
will
take
my
medicine
sack
bows
and
arrows
and
my
head
you
must
then
untie
the
sack
and
spread
out
before
you
my
paints
of
all
colors
my
war
eagle
feathers
my
tufts
of
dried
hair
and
whatever
else
it
contains
as
the
bear
approaches
you
will
take
all
these
articles
one
by
one
and
say
to
him
this
is
my
deceased
brother's
paint
and
so
on
with
all
the
other
articles
throwing
each
of
them
as
far
as
you
can
the
virtues
contained
in
them
will
cause
him
to
totter
and
to
complete
his
destruction
you
will
take
my
head
and
that
too
you
will
cast
as
far
off
as
you
can
crying
aloud
see
this
is
my
deceased
brother's
head
he
will
then
fall
senseless
by
this
time
the
young
men
will
have
eaten
and
you
will
call
them
to
your
assistance
you
must
then
cut
the
carcass
into
pieces
yes
into
small
pieces
and
scatter
them
to
the
four
winds
for
unless
you
do
this
he
will
again
revive
she
promised
that
all
should
be
done
as
he
said
she
had
only
time
to
prepare
the
meat
when
the
voice
of
the
leader
was
heard
calling
upon
iamo
for
aid
the
woman
went
out
and
said
as
her
brother
had
directed
but
the
war
party
being
closely
pursued
came
up
to
the
lodge
she
invited
them
in
and
placed
the
meat
before
them
while
they
were
eating
they
heard
the
bear
approaching
untying
the
medicine
sack
and
taking
the
head
she
had
all
in
readiness
for
his
approach
when
he
came
up
she
did
as
she
had
been
told
and
before
she
had
expended
the
paints
and
feathers
the
bear
began
to
totter
but
still
advancing
came
close
to
the
woman
saying
as
she
was
commanded
she
then
took
the
head
and
cast
it
as
far
from
her
as
she
could
as
it
rolled
along
the
ground
the
blood
excited
by
the
feelings
of
the
head
in
this
terrible
scene
gushed
from
the
nose
and
mouth
the
bear
tottering
soon
fell
with
a
tremendous
noise
then
she
cried
for
help
and
the
young
men
came
rushing
out
having
partially
regained
their
strength
and
spirits
mudjikewis
stepping
up
gave
a
yell
and
struck
him
a
blow
upon
the
head
this
he
repeated
till
it
seemed
like
a
mass
of
brains
while
the
others
as
quick
as
possible
cut
him
into
very
small
pieces
which
they
then
scattered
in
every
direction
while
thus
employed
happening
to
look
around
where
they
had
thrown
the
meat
wonderful
to
behold
they
saw
starting
up
and
turning
off
in
every
direction
small
black
bears
such
as
are
seen
at
the
present
day
the
country
was
soon
overspread
with
these
black
animals
and
it
was
from
this
monster
that
the
present
race
of
bears
derived
their
origin
having
thus
overcome
their
pursuer
they
returned
to
the
lodge
in
the
meantime
the
woman
gathering
the
implements
she
had
used
and
the
head
placed
them
again
in
the
sack
but
the
head
did
not
speak
again
probably
from
its
great
exertion
to
overcome
the
monster
having
spent
so
much
time
and
traversed
so
vast
a
country
in
their
flight
the
young
men
gave
up
the
idea
of
ever
returning
to
their
own
country
and
game
being
plenty
they
determined
to
remain
where
they
now
were
one
day
they
moved
off
some
distance
from
the
lodge
for
the
purpose
of
hunting
having
left
the
wampum
with
the
woman
they
were
very
successful
and
amused
themselves
as
all
young
men
do
when
alone
by
talking
and
jesting
with
each
other
one
of
them
spoke
and
said
we
have
all
this
sport
to
ourselves
let
us
go
and
ask
our
sister
if
she
will
not
let
us
bring
the
head
to
this
place
as
it
is
still
alive
it
may
be
pleased
to
hear
us
talk
and
be
in
our
company
in
the
meantime
take
food
to
our
sister
they
went
and
requested
the
head
she
told
them
to
take
it
and
they
took
it
to
their
hunting
grounds
and
tried
to
amuse
it
but
only
at
times
did
they
see
its
eyes
beam
with
pleasure
one
day
while
busy
in
their
encampment
they
were
unexpectedly
attacked
by
unknown
indians
the
skirmish
was
long
contested
and
bloody
many
of
their
foes
were
slain
but
still
they
were
thirty
to
one
the
young
men
fought
desperately
till
they
were
all
killed
the
attacking
party
then
retreated
to
a
height
of
ground
to
muster
their
men
and
to
count
the
number
of
missing
and
slain
one
of
their
young
men
had
stayed
away
and
in
endeavoring
to
overtake
them
came
to
the
place
where
the
head
was
hung
up
seeing
that
alone
retain
animation
he
eyed
it
for
some
time
with
fear
and
surprise
however
he
took
it
down
and
opened
the
sack
and
was
much
pleased
to
see
the
beautiful
feathers
one
of
which
he
placed
on
his
head
starting
off
it
waved
gracefully
over
him
till
he
reached
his
party
when
he
threw
down
the
head
and
sack
and
told
them
how
he
had
found
it
and
that
the
sack
was
full
of
paints
and
feathers
they
all
looked
at
the
head
and
made
sport
of
it
numbers
of
the
young
men
took
the
paint
and
painted
themselves
and
one
of
the
party
took
the
head
by
the
hair
and
said
look
you
ugly
thing
and
see
your
paints
on
the
faces
of
warriors
but
the
feathers
were
so
beautiful
that
numbers
of
them
also
placed
them
on
their
heads
then
again
they
used
all
kinds
of
indignity
to
the
head
for
which
they
were
in
turn
repaid
by
the
death
of
those
who
had
used
the
feathers
then
the
chief
commanded
them
to
throw
away
all
except
the
head
we
will
see
said
he
when
we
get
home
what
we
can
do
with
it
we
will
try
to
make
it
shut
its
eyes
when
they
reached
their
homes
they
took
it
to
the
council
lodge
and
hung
it
up
before
the
fire
fastening
it
with
raw
hide
soaked
which
would
shrink
and
become
tightened
by
the
action
of
the
fire
we
will
then
see
they
said
if
we
cannot
make
it
shut
its
eyes
meantime
for
several
days
the
sister
had
been
waiting
for
the
young
men
to
bring
back
the
head
till
at
last
getting
impatient
she
went
in
search
of
it
the
young
men
she
found
lying
within
short
distances
of
each
other
dead
and
covered
with
wounds
various
other
bodies
lay
scattered
in
different
directions
around
them
she
searched
for
the
head
and
sack
but
they
were
nowhere
to
be
found
she
raised
her
voice
and
wept
and
blackened
her
face
then
she
walked
in
different
directions
till
she
came
to
the
place
from
whence
the
head
had
been
taken
then
she
found
the
magic
bow
and
arrows
where
the
young
men
ignorant
of
their
qualities
had
left
them
she
thought
to
herself
that
she
would
find
her
brother's
head
and
came
to
a
piece
of
rising
ground
and
there
saw
some
of
his
paints
and
feathers
these
she
carefully
put
up
and
hung
upon
the
branch
of
a
tree
till
her
return
at
dusk
she
arrived
at
the
first
lodge
of
a
very
extensive
village
here
she
used
a
charm
common
among
indians
when
they
wish
to
meet
with
a
kind
reception
on
applying
to
the
old
man
and
woman
of
the
lodge
she
was
kindly
received
she
made
known
her
errand
the
old
man
promised
to
aid
her
and
told
her
the
head
was
hung
up
before
the
council
fire
and
that
the
chiefs
of
the
village
with
their
young
men
kept
watch
over
it
continually
the
former
are
considered
as
manitoes
she
said
she
only
wished
to
see
it
and
would
be
satisfied
if
she
could
only
get
to
the
door
of
the
lodge
she
knew
she
had
not
sufficient
power
to
take
it
by
force
come
with
me
said
the
indian
i
will
take
you
there
they
went
and
they
took
their
seats
near
the
door
the
council
lodge
was
filled
with
warriors
amusing
themselves
with
games
and
constantly
keeping
up
a
fire
to
smoke
the
head
as
they
said
to
make
dry
meat
they
saw
the
head
move
and
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
it
one
spoke
and
said
ha
ha
it
is
beginning
to
feel
the
effects
of
the
smoke
the
sister
looked
up
from
the
door
and
her
eyes
met
those
of
her
brother
and
tears
rolled
down
the
cheeks
of
the
head
well
said
the
chief
i
thought
we
would
make
you
do
something
at
last
look
look
at
it
shedding
tears
said
he
to
those
around
him
and
they
all
laughed
and
passed
their
jokes
upon
it
the
chief
looking
around
and
observing
the
woman
after
some
time
said
to
the
man
who
came
with
her
who
have
you
got
there
i
have
never
seen
that
woman
before
in
our
village
yes
replied
the
man
you
have
seen
her
she
is
a
relation
of
mine
and
seldom
goes
out
she
stays
at
my
lodge
and
asked
me
to
allow
her
to
come
with
me
to
this
place
in
the
center
of
the
lodge
sat
one
of
those
young
men
who
are
always
forward
and
fond
of
boasting
and
displaying
themselves
before
others
why
said
he
i
have
seen
her
often
and
it
is
to
this
lodge
i
go
almost
every
night
to
court
her
all
the
others
laughed
and
continued
their
games
the
young
man
did
not
know
he
was
telling
a
lie
to
the
woman's
advantage
who
by
that
means
escaped
she
returned
to
the
man's
lodge
and
immediately
set
out
for
her
own
country
coming
to
the
spot
where
the
bodies
of
her
adopted
brothers
lay
she
placed
them
together
their
feet
toward
the
east
then
taking
an
ax
which
she
had
she
cast
it
up
into
the
air
crying
out
brothers
get
up
from
under
it
or
it
will
fall
on
you
this
she
repeated
three
times
and
the
third
time
the
brothers
all
arose
and
stood
on
their
feet
mudjikewis
commenced
rubbing
his
eyes
and
stretching
himself
why
said
he
i
have
overslept
myself
no
indeed
said
one
of
the
others
do
you
not
know
we
were
all
killed
and
that
it
is
our
sister
who
has
brought
us
to
life
the
young
men
took
the
bodies
of
their
enemies
and
burned
them
soon
after
the
woman
went
to
procure
wives
for
them
in
a
distant
country
they
knew
not
where
but
she
returned
with
ten
young
women
which
she
gave
to
the
ten
young
men
beginning
with
the
eldest
mudjikewis
stepped
to
and
fro
uneasy
lest
he
should
not
get
the
one
he
liked
but
he
was
not
disappointed
for
she
fell
to
his
lot
and
they
were
well
matched
for
she
was
a
female
magician
they
then
all
moved
into
a
very
large
lodge
and
their
sister
told
them
that
the
women
must
now
take
turns
in
going
to
her
brother's
head
every
night
trying
to
untie
it
they
all
said
they
would
do
so
with
pleasure
the
eldest
made
the
first
attempt
and
with
a
rushing
noise
she
fled
through
the
air
toward
daylight
she
returned
she
had
been
unsuccessful
as
she
succeeded
in
untying
only
one
of
the
knots
all
took
their
turns
regularly
and
each
one
succeeded
in
untying
only
one
knot
each
time
but
when
the
youngest
went
she
commenced
the
work
as
soon
as
she
reached
the
lodge
although
it
had
always
been
occupied
still
the
indians
never
could
see
any
one
for
ten
nights
now
the
smoke
had
not
ascended
but
filled
the
lodge
and
drove
them
out
this
last
night
they
were
all
driven
out
and
the
young
woman
carried
off
the
head
the
young
people
and
the
sister
heard
the
young
woman
coming
high
through
the
air
and
they
heard
her
saying
prepare
the
body
of
our
brother
and
as
soon
as
they
heard
it
they
went
to
a
small
lodge
where
the
black
body
of
iamo
lay
his
sister
commenced
cutting
the
neck
part
from
which
the
neck
had
been
severed
she
cut
so
deep
as
to
cause
it
to
bleed
and
the
others
who
were
present
by
rubbing
the
body
and
applying
medicines
expelled
the
blackness
in
the
meantime
the
one
who
brought
it
by
cutting
the
neck
of
the
head
caused
that
also
to
bleed
as
soon
as
she
arrived
they
placed
that
close
to
the
body
and
by
aid
of
medicines
and
various
other
means
succeeded
in
restoring
iamo
to
all
his
former
beauty
and
manliness
all
rejoiced
in
the
happy
termination
of
their
troubles
and
they
had
spent
some
time
joyfully
together
when
iamo
said
now
i
will
divide
the
wampum
and
getting
the
belt
which
contained
it
he
commenced
with
the
eldest
giving
it
in
equal
portions
but
the
youngest
got
the
most
splendid
and
beautiful
as
the
bottom
of
the
belt
held
the
richest
and
rarest
they
were
told
that
since
they
had
all
once
died
and
were
restored
to
life
they
were
no
longer
mortal
but
spirits
and
they
were
assigned
different
stations
in
the
invisible
world
only
mudjikewis's
place
was
however
named
he
was
to
direct
the
west
wind
hence
generally
called
kebeyun
there
to
remain
for
ever
they
were
commanded
as
they
had
it
in
their
power
to
do
good
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
earth
and
forgetting
their
sufferings
in
procuring
the
wampum
to
give
all
things
with
a
liberal
hand
and
they
were
also
commanded
that
it
should
also
be
held
by
them
sacred
those
grains
or
shells
of
the
pale
hue
to
be
emblematic
of
peace
while
those
of
the
darker
hue
would
lead
to
evil
and
war
the
spirits
then
amid
songs
and
shouts
took
their
flight
to
their
respective
abodes
on
high
while
iamo
with
his
sister
iamoqua
descended
into
the
depths
below
